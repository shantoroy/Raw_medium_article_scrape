Because being able to see what the program actually does is critical when transacting on the blockchain where code is law.In this quick guide you\u2019ll learn the language basics so that you are too able to to create vyper contracts.Why VyperThe language\u2019s principals are simple:- Security: it should be designed in a way that security comes automatically when writing the smart contract without having to do extensive tests and security checks.- Language and compiler simplicity: both should strive to create simple code that is not overcomplicated with unnecessary functionality.- Auditability: the ultimate goal is to have a programming language that is simple to read by any person regardless of their experience with computers in order to give them understanding while keeping security a priority by making difficult to write bad code.That\u2019s why Vyper is limited in functions compared to Solidity where you have less restrictions in place, to help people understand the code while making it secure. Based on those 3 principals, Vyper has a unique set of features for smart contract programming:- Bounds and overflow checking: On array accesses as well as on arithmetic level. Many of the issues with traditional smart contracts written in solidity is the fact that mathematical calculations are insecure because of the EVM\u2019s natural restrictions. You can\u2019t store an endlessly large number on a uint variable because it would be abused, and miners would have to process excessive computations every time. Vyper aims to solve that by checking overflow and underflow issues when compiling.- Support for signed integers and decimal fixed-point numbers: in this programming language you can have positive and negative integers with decimals unlike Solidity where decimals are not allowed because of number rounding limitations.- Decidability: It should be possible to compute a precise upper bound for the gas consumption of any function call. In other words, every function should provide a clear indication of how much gas it consumes at any point.- Strong typing: Including support for units (e.g. timestamp, timedelta, seconds, wei, wei per second, meters per second squared). Many new types are added to Vyper to provide better readability.- Small and understandable compiler code: the compiler code is optimized as much as possible in every contract.- Limited support for pure functions: Anything marked constant is not allowed to change the state which forces developers to guarantee that the code is behaving as expected.However, to fully implement the desired goals, Vyper is limited in functionality and thus it doesn\u2019t have the following programming capabilities:- Modifiers: they are not available because they may code tedious to understand since you have to jump back and forth to the modifier definition and because developers could write misleading code with unexpected functionality.- Class inheritance: when a smart contract inherits from many others, you have to jump back and forth between them to fully understand what is going on. Also, it\u2019s another point where programmers could write misleading code that executes unexpected functionality.- Inline assembly: assembly code is not searchable since functions and variables change their names to simpler values that are harder to understand and modify.- Function overloading: it\u2019s a problematic feature where the same function with different parameters could damage users with dangerous code.- Operator overloading: another problematic feature where developers could for instance, change the + operator to a potentially dangerous function.- Recursive calling: it makes function gas costs hard to predict and it\u2019s one of the many reasons you can\u2019t fully know how much gas you need to execute every function in solidity. By removing this feature, we also remove the possibility of gas limit attacks such as the reentrancy attack.- Endless loops: such as while and for loops without restrictions. They make impossible to calculate gas limits and could be used as an attack vector.- Binary fixed point: decimal fixed point is better, because any decimal fixed point value written as a literal in code has an exact representation, whereas with binary fixed point approximations are often required (e.g. (0.2)10 = (0.001100110011\u2026)2, which needs to be truncated), leading to unintuitive results, e.g. in Python 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.1 != 1.File structureIn Vyper you don\u2019t have to specify the version of the compiler since the best one is automatically chosen for your smart contract. You can start writing code immediately in a .vy file or using an online compiler such as vyper.online which I recommend to help you with debugging and compiling quickly as you develop.VariablesVyper has a wider variety of types of variables because they want to improve readability as much as possible. Therefore, what\u2019s better than a descriptive type of variable?In Vyper you start with the variable name, then a colon and the variable type with the visibility. Variable\u2019s visibility is the same as in solidity and you specify them like so:myVariableName: public(uint256)As you can see, you start with the variable\u2019s name and then you declare the type without a semicolon at the end since this is a python-based language.Variables in Vyper can either be private or public. Public means that anybody can access that variable including external contracts and private means that the variable can only be modified internally in this contract. To make a variable public, use the keyword public before the type and to make it private, just use the type without the public keyword.myVariableName: public(uint256) # A public variablemySecondVariable: uint256 # A private variableRemember that each smart contract needs to be setup in a single file so it\u2019s independent. These are state variables that get declared at the top of the contract. Note that you can\u2019t give a value to the variable when defining the type of the state variables.Following are the types of variables available in vyper:- uints: unsigned-integers which just like in solidity, can only be positive numbers. In vyper you only have the 256-bit version so all your unsigned-integers must be declared as uint256 including the number at the end instead of just uint. For example:myNumber: uint256- ints: signed-integers. These integers can be either positive or negative and as such, can only hold up to 128 bits of data so all your ints will be int128. Additionally, you can use the min(x, y) and max(x, y) functions with integers for making quick calculations. For example:myNumber: int128- booleans: they can either be true or false. You specify them with the bool keyword. For example:isValid: boolWhen dealing with if statements and conditions using Booleans you have several operators that you need to know such as:x not y: Logical negation. Instead of using the ! symbol in front of the boolean, you use the not keyword.x and y: Logical conjunction instead of using the usual && symbol.x or y: Logical disjunction instead of the usual || symbol.- decimals: this new type of variable stores a number with a precision of 10 decimal places between -2**127 and (2**127\u20131). Remember that in order to compare numerical variables, they must be of the same type i.e. both numbers have to be decimals. For example:myDecimalNumber: decimal- addresses: just like in solidity, a variable that contains an Ethereum address in hexadecimal notation with a leading 0x marker. For example:myAddress: addressNote that you can retrieve the balance contained in an address with the balance member variable:myAddress.balance- bytes: bytes store pieces of text in hexadecimal format. You can either use bytes32 or a custom bytes size. The larger it is, the longer text you\u2019ll be able to store inside with some clear limitations based on the gas limits. Basically they are strings with limited length. Fixed-size byte arrays can hold strings with equal or fewer characters than the maximum length of the byte array. For instance:username: public(bytes32)myArticle: bytes[1000]The variable myArticle will be able to store a string of up to 1000 characters while the username will be able to store a 32-character text. Custom-size byte arrays have several interesting functions that you\u2019ll often use when dealing with large strings:len(x): returns the length of the string.sha3(): returns the keccak256 hash as bytes32 of the string.concat(x, . . .) concatenates multiple byte texts into one.slice(x, start=y, len=z): to cut a string into a shorter piece. Starts at y with the length z.Those are the main variable types available in vyper. After that, you have personalized unit types based on decimals, uints and ints. These are new types that you can freely create to improve the readability of your code by using custom words. Vyper has 3 unit types built in:- timestamp and timedelta: both measure time in seconds so 1 unit of this type is 1 second. Timestamp represents a point of time i.e. a specific date while timedelta contains the number of seconds. For instance:whenThisWasDone: timestampexpirationTime: timedeltaThey measure time and are based on the uint256 type.- wei_value: a measure of ether in the smallest unit, the wei which is one 18th part of 1 ether. Again, based on the uint256 type so it has the same limitations regarding positive-only numbers. For instance:amountSpent: wei_valueAlternatively, you can create your own custom unit types for improving your code\u2019s readability. Here\u2019s how it would look like:units: {   centimeter: \u201ccentimeter\u201d,   km: \u201ckilometer\u201d}Define them at the top of the file. You\u2019ll then be able to use them with a conversion parameter being either uint256, int128 or decimal. For instance:myCustomMeasure: uint256(centimeter)distanceFromMars: decimal(km)Those variables will store the same numerical values as simple uints or decimals, but they now have a specific unit type that give them a deeper meaning that improves readability to the external programmer.ArraysArrays in Vyper are pretty much the same thing as in Solidity. They are called lists since that\u2019s the official python terminology but in my opinion, it\u2019s just easier to call them arrays. You can create multidimensional arrays and simple arrays with square brackets however they all must be fixed with a limited size set beforehand. For instance:# An array of uintsmyNumbers: public(uint256[10])# A multidimensional array of addressesmyAddresses: address[10][20]# An array of 30 texts of 1000 characters eachmyArticles: public(bytes[1000][30])To add elements to your fixed-size arrays, you\u2019ll often have a counter of the latest modified index so that you can update it:myNumbers[3] = 25# With a counter variable it would look like thismyNumbers[latestNumberIndex] = 25# Set multiple valuesmyNumbers = [1, 4, 7, 3, 2, 9, 1, 3, 0, 9]# Get the value of a specific indexreturn myNumbers[4]Remember that arrays have 4 useful functions to get the length, calculate the hash, concatenate arrays and to slice them as previously seen in the bytes type definition.StructsStructs are pretty straightforward. You define them like in solidity but with python\u2019s syntax so it will look like this:# Create a structstruct Tree:   age: timestamp   name: bytes32# Create the struct instance variable (inside a function only)myTrees: Tree[10]# Initialize the struct (inside a function only)myTrees[0] = Tree({12, \u201cMy own tree\u201d})# Accessing a value (inside a function only)myTrees[0].timestamp = 19182They are great for creating objects that store complex types of data.MappingsMappings work the same way as in solidity. They just store endless amounts of variables in hash tables that can be retrieved with the index type. You can only declare them as state variables and modify them inside functions. Here\u2019s the syntax:myMapping: map(int128, bool)# To access a value (can only be done inside functions)myMapping[28] = TrueThat\u2019s all about Vyper\u2019s variables. You now know how to use them and how to define them. Let\u2019s take a look at functions and to fully understand a smart contract\u2019s structure.EventsEvents in vyper are pretty straightforward:# Event definitionMyEvent: event({from: indexed(address), amount: uint256})# Calling the event inside a functionlog.MyEvent(msg.sender, 10)As you can see, the event is similar to how you create it on solidity. You can use the keyword indexed to make that parameter searchable inside the blockchain\u2019s past events. Then, you can execute it with the function log.<yourEvent>().Note that they must be defined at the top of the file before the state variables and functions.FunctionsFunctions in vyper are similar to those on solidity but with python syntax. You still have to specify the visibility, the return values and the parameters. Here\u2019s how a function in vyper looks like:@publicdef sumTwoNumbers(numberA: uint256, numberB: uint256) -> uint256:   return numberA + numberThe return value is indicated with the arrow syntax -> instead of using the returns() keyword compared to solidity and the visibility is indicated using decorators which are just special keywords on top of the function.Functions in vyper can either be public or private. Public means that anybody can access and execute the function while private means that it can only be executed by the contract itself, just like internal functions in solidity.You can also add the @payable decorator to be able to receive funds with the function call. For instance:FundsReceived: event({amount: wei_value})@public@payabledef receiveFunds():   log.FundsReceived(msg.value)When a function is payable, you can access the ether received with msg.value.To read of modify state variables inside functions, you must use the self keyword. Here\u2019s how it looks like:myNumber: uint256@publicdef exampleFunction():   self.myNumber = 3If you don\u2019t, the compiler will think that you want to access the local variable with that name which makes the use of underscores before the variable naming unnecessary for function parameters compared to solidity where you must use underscores to update state variables easily.The constructorThe constructor is just like in python. Use the __init__ function to setup initial variables or execute internal mechanisms when the contract is deployed. For instance:@publicdef __init__():   # Do something here when the contract is deployedObviously, the constructor can\u2019t return any value, so it makes no sense to provide a return value to it.The fallback functionThis function is the one being executed when you send a transaction to the contract without specifying the function that you want to call, basically when making ether transfers to the contract. Here\u2019s how it looks like in vyper:@public@payabledef __default__():   # Do something when receiving a transferDocumenting your functions with NatSpecThe NatSpec documentation is a simple way to explain what your functions are supposed to do. It\u2019s important that you use to facility the understanding of your code for future developers and to improve it in the longer term. Here\u2019s how it looks like:@publicdef addNumbers(numberA: int128, numberB: int128) -> int128:   \"\"\"   @author Merunas Grincalaitis   @notice Adds 2 given integers and returns the result   @dev Works with either positive and negative numbers   @param numberA The first number to add   @param numberB The second number to add   @return int128 The number resulting after the addition   \"\"\"   return numberA + numberBAs you can see, you have several parameters to describe your functions. @notice is the one used to explain what the function is supposed to do for external readers. Be as concise and clear as possible. @param and @author describe the parameters of the function and the function\u2019s creator.And @dev is for giving additional information for coders to help understand some internal logic that may be irrelevant to the end users.SummaryThat\u2019s about it!

All Vyper syntax is valid Python 3 syntax, although it has not adopted the entirety of Python 3\u2019s feature set. Vyper is in its early stages of development, but the open source project is available for us to dive into and contribute to right now.This article will outline the real principles and reasons behind Vyper, the differences to Solidity, and various syntax we should be aware of. Finally we will visit the installation process of Vpyer.I personally like the project \u2014 looking at their example smart contracts is very seducing; they look and feel like Python; the contracts present themselves in a very familiar way Python developers have come to appreciate, and this simplicity is beneficial for reasons we will discuss further down the article.If you would like to familiarise yourself with Solidity as well as Vyper, visit my Solidity on-boarding article aimed at developers to start writing smart contracts with the language:Writing Smart Contracts with Solidity > 0.5A brief walkthrough to start writing Ethereum smart contracts with Solidity 0.5 and abovemedium.comVyper First Glance & PreconceptionsAt a first glance we notice some very nice Pythonic ways that Vyper smart contracts are created with. Decorators are used to inject extra functionality into each method, scrapping Solidity\u2019s modifiers in the process. We use the familiar __init__ as the contract\u2019s constructor method, which is executed once when the contract is first deployed. Defining contract parameters is clean. With Python being a statically typed language, we define the signatures of each parameter we will be working with at the top of the contract, in a name: scope(type) like fashion, for example:highestBid: public(wei_value)As you can see here with wei_value, Vyper have introduced some Ethereum specific data types \u2014 this is only one of a range of types we can exploit in Vyper smart contracts.Vyper aims to minimise bugs, maximise auditabilityThe wei_value type demonstrates well what Vyper is all about.wei_value is the smallest denomination of Ether. Where decimal numbers are concerned, Vyper have opted to work with real fixed point values, rather than binary fixed point approximations.This demonstrates one of the core principles of Vyper \u2014 minimising room for error.With the belief that we as developers read code more than write it, we want to understand quickly and make contributions without guessing or error. Seeing an actual value rather than an approximation or truncated representation of the value aids in that process; what I am seeing are tangible values.Is Vyper more secure than Solidity?What you may have heard on video blogs or articles online are claims that Vyper is a more secure language than Solidity.Is this true? Not entirely. Although the probability of bugs is reduced, it is still the developers responsibility to ensure secure code.Now, what Vyper does include are some bug contingencies for us \u2014 we can utilise upper bounds for gas consumption, and can utilise bound and overflow checking. These are neat features to minimise bugs, but regardless of the language you adopt, it is still the developer\u2019s responsibility to write readable, maintainable code.The language we use is only a tool, the values of which we can either embrace or ignore. We could utilise Solidity\u2019s more verbose nature to create a great contract; we could also utilise Vyper\u2019s simplified nature to create an equally great contract.Concretely, Solidity and Vyper are both higher level languages that compile into bytecode, which in turn is deployed on the blockchain. A Solidity contract and Vyper contract hosting the same logic will have almost identical bytecode when compiled.So where does the added security lie if not in language contingencies? In the coding practices of the developers. In their development process, testing process, auditing process and documentation \u2014 both inline and through readme\u2019s and change-logs. Seasoned Python developers will be fully aware that well-written code acts as a means of documentation itself; let the code tell the story so comments are not needed \u2014 and when they are, have a detailed docstring with function usage examples.Without digressing too much into code practices, let\u2019s visit some other things you may have heard about Vyper.Vyper in experimentation, not commercially readyWhen I hear this being said, I reply with this: Name me a blockchain that is commercially ready and not in experimentation.Yes, Vyper is experimental and there will be changes. But do not let this stop you from experimenting with Vyper yourself; the facts are as follows:We can install, compile and deploy smart contracts with Vyper today.While Vyper is still in early development, so is every blockchain, including Bitcoin. Examine the disagreements within the Bitcoin community to realise that we are still far from where we need to be for it (and other blockchains) to become mainstream solutions for the world.Vyper and the Ethereum ecosystem is open source. It is constantly in development, proposals are being submitted and fine-tuned before being deployed, on a constant basis. There will be commercial use cases early on (ICO, ownership of virtual goods) that are realised way before others are technically possible (payment systems that compete with the speed and scale of centralised solutions). But they are coming.Vyper is here today; let\u2019s begin using it.There is one other big Vyper myth I will address.Vyper solves the learning curve issue of Solidity = falseIt is important to realise that Vyper is not a fix for the Solidity learning curve theory. It is an alternative to Solidity, not a replacement.The claims that developers will not embrace Solidity because it is yet another language to learn, with another learning curve which will take weeks to learn are simply false. Other blockchain groups have used this theory as a marketing tactic to create a perception of a weakness within Ethereum. But ultimately, Solidity is not hard to learn.Solidity adheres to object oriented design patterns developers will be familiar with from every other object oriented language out there. A developer could, without issue, read through the Solidity documentation and study the smart contract examples in a matter of hours, before adopting the basic ERC-20 contract or similar contracts.What Vyper does is offer an alternative smart contract language that aims to solve completely different issues to the issue of learning difficulty.Now, let\u2019s move onto what Vyper offers us on a more feature based level.What Vyper OffersVyper offers us a full smart contract development solution. The Vyper compiler is written in Python, whereas the Solidity compiler is C++ based. Although C++ is dramatically faster than Python, speed is traded with consistency in the Vyper pipeline.Like Solidity, there is an online IDE for Vyper, at https://vyper.online. Vyper can also be integrated into a Truffle development workflow, allowing you to test Vyper contracts on local private blockchains very easily.Apart from the syntax and core principles we have talked about, there are other big differences to Solidity. They are listed on Vyper\u2019s Github home page, but for completeness here are the main differences:No modifiers. Modifiers can add complexity and make code less readable \u2014 this goes against Vypers goal of making code as readable as possible. We don\u2019t want to worry about understanding the rules of precedence within our contracts when conflicts occur, nor do we want to jump around numerous contract files to find where those conflicts occur.No inline assembly. The idea of compiled code inside of Vyper code is a big no no. Variables will be represented differently making it impossible to CMD+F all instances of them. The switching of syntax also makes the code less readable.No function overloading. The last thing we want to do is worry about which version of a function is being called, creating confusion when errors occur and time wasted troubleshooting inconsistencies.No operator overloading. Vyper argue using such syntax as += looks misleading. Operator overloading is also not Pythonic.No class inheritance. Again, jumping through multiple files to understand what the code is doing is anti-Vyper.No recursive calling and no infinite loops. These are dangerous when we need to spend gas for every contract operation, greatly increasing the probability of gas attacks.No binary fixed points. As discussed above, Vyper opts to display values as an exact representation.It almost feels as though Vyper thought Solidity was a way too verbose language given the lack of experience the world has had with smart contract development. After all, once a contract is on the blockchain we cannot change it. If a bug is discovered our only option is to replace the entire contract, which comes with major migration difficulties and expenses associated with doing so.So what Vyper is saying is, let\u2019s take a step back and focus on what we have learnt so far \u2014 maybe readability, auditability, simplicity (and therefore security) are far more important than issues like language robustness at this moment in time.Now the community have the option to make that call.Vyper SyntaxHere we will outline some interesting ways we can code smart contracts with the pythonic Vyper.The best way to familiarise yourself with Vyper syntax is visiting the Vyper by Example documentation page, where a range of example contracts are included for us with comprehensive breakdowns. The examples range from an auction / bidding use case, product purchasing, crowdfunding, voting and company share management.Contract variables and selfWe can access contract variables from any function with self. For Vyper contracts, it is recommended we define all contract variables at the top of the contract.Examining the auction contract on the Vyper examples page, we are defining the beneficiary, auctionStart and auctionEnd contract variables by providing the _beneficiary and _bidding_time arguments for the __init__ method:beneficiary: public(address)auctionStart: public(timestamp)auctionEnd: public(timestamp)@publicdef __init__(_beneficiary: address, _bidding_time: timedelta):    self.beneficiary = _beneficiary    self.auctionStart = block.timestamp    self.auctionEnd = self.auctionStart + _bidding_timeAlso use self to call other methods within the contract, with self.<method_name>()Data typesVyper provide a dedicated page for the types it supports. Along with common types such as booleans, signed ints, unsigned ints, decimals, strings and byte arrays, we also have access to some other Vyper smart contract specific types:timestamp and timedelta: These are both unix based (uint256) time values. timedelta represents a period of time, and can be added to a timestamp value. We can also add 2 timedelta together, but cannot add 2 timestamp together \u2014 this is logically incorrect, as a timestamp represents a certain point in time. For time manipulations timedelta is the type to use, such as the bidding time period on the auction contract.address: The address type holds an Ethereum address. We can also gather the balance of an address with _address.balance, and the code size of the address with _address.codesize.Note: variable names prefixed with underscores are used throughout the Vyper documentation, which represent a local method variable where a contract variable may have the same name, as to not confuse ourselves between the two. They can also be used to distinguish a variable from a type declaration.wei_value: We touched on this type above, which is the amount of Ether in wei, of base type uint256.Custom types with units{}: Custom types can also be defined with a base type. For example, if we needed units in say, kph (kilometres per hour), we could define a custom type for this:#define custom typesunits = {    kph: 'kilometres per hour'}#use custom typecarSpeed: int128(kph)Structs: useful for defining custom data structures that consist of multiple variables:car: {   owner: address   value: wei_value,   maxSpeed: int128(kph)}_car.owner = msg.sendermsg and contract objectsLike Solidity, Vyper gives us access to the msg variable within every function defined in the contract. We can access its member variables sender and value to retrieve details of the address that called the contract \u2014 sender being the Ethereum address, and value being the amount of Ether the user sent with the call (or transaction \u2014 every interaction with a smart contract entails a transaction to take place).assertAssert throws an error if a certain condition is not met, and is used at the beginning of methods to check if criteria are met for the method to process. If not the transaction is reverted and the contract terminates.assert is commonly used to check if a user has a sufficient balance to carry out a transaction:assert msg.value <= self.car.valueAnother more unique example of this is within the refund method of the crowdfunding Vyper contract:def refund():   assert block.timestamp >= self.deadline and self.balance < self.goal    ...The contract is reverted if 2 things happen here:If the block timestamp \u2014 the timestamp of the current block of the Ethereum blockchain we happen to be on \u2014 is greater than the deadline of the crowdfunding campaign. Because we do not want activity carried out once the campaign has ended.And if the contract balance has not reached the goal of the campaign. Because if the campaign\u2019s goal was reached the funds should no longer be accessible for refunds.Overall, asserting is widely used as a clean way to condition methods.EventsEvents are an important part of the Ethereum EVM / web3 ecosystem whereby web applications can listen out for events that happen on the blockchain and react to them.In the example contracts, Vyper define events after our custom units{} but before contract variables. Take a look at a Transfer event that takes the following form:Transfer: event({_from: indexed(address), _to: indexed(address), _value: uint256(currency_value)})This Transfer event emits the from address, to address and value of the transfer. These key value pairs are wrapped in a JSON like format with curly braces which provide the only argument to the event() function:<NameOfEvent>: event({nKey: nValue, ...});Events are undoubtedly very useful for letting web3 based applications know the state of your contract execution.__default__ methodThe __default__ method is executed when a call to the contract is made without a function identifier, or if the supplied identifier did not match any within the contract. __default__ must be annotated with @public. It cannot have arguments and cannot return anything.AnnotationsAnnotations (or decorators) of methods allow us to define whether they are public or private, as well as other configurations such as payable and constant that are Ethereum specific. Decorators inject more functionality into methods in a clean, concise way.Most methods you define will be public and take the following form:@publicdef myMethod():   ...We can annotate methods with any number of decorators too. Consider adding the constant decorator, which means the method only reads the blockchain without modifying its state \u2014 think readonly.@public@constantdef myReadMethod():   ...@payable is another useful decorator. If the method is annotated as @payable, it is executed whenever the contract is sent Ether (without data). __default__ would most likely need to be executed in this case:@payable@publicdef __default__():    ...Built in functionsIt is important to remember that Vyper does not include all of Python 3, so familiarising yourself with the built in functions available will save on unintended errors, which can be found here.As a general rule, if you are unsure on what syntax to use \u2014 think Python. Vyper\u2019s online IDE will flag errors and warnings should mistakes be made, making experimentation a good way to get to grips with Vyper smart contracts.Installing VyperVyper is available to download, compile and install on all major operating systems. It is highly recommended to install it within a Python virtual environment. As well as compiling from source, we can also use pip to install vyper:pip install vyperAnd also have access to a Docker image:docker pull ethereum/vyperVyper have a dedicated page for installation. Without repeating too much of the content, I recommend visiting it to see details for your preferred installation method:Installing Vyper \u2014 Vyper documentationVyper can only be built using Python 3.6 and higher. If you are already running Python 3.6, skip to the next section\u2026vyper.readthedocs.ioIf an installation issue crops up on your system, be sure to let the developers know\u2014 post an issue on Github for the community to work through. If you do encounter an error, you can still experiment with https://vyper.onlnie while you await collaboration on your issue.And this wraps up this introductory talk on Vyper. Be sure to review the documentation to familiarise yourself with everything the language offers (and does not offer).I am also interested in hearing what other developers think of Vyper \u2014 let me know in the comments or on social media.Refer to the following links to work your way through the documentation and Github project:Vyper DocumentationVyper is a contract-oriented, pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\u2026vyper.readthedocs.ioGithub: ethereum/vyperPythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM.

Unless someone forks over money, you can\u2019t count them as a customer.How many times have you gotten someone to \u201cpledge\u201d that they\u2019ll be a customer only to have them come up with an excuse later on why they won\u2019t be.But charging is hard especially when your beta users are people you want to keep happy \u2014 sometimes they could be your close friends. Sometimes it could be an influencer that you don\u2019t want to offend or a business relationship that you don\u2019t want to lose.Whatever the reason, it\u2019s hard to come out and say, \u201ccan you give me money?\u201d when you have an unproven product or even just an idea.It was something I struggled with for a long, long time, but I finally cracked the code with my latest startup, VYPER, which is a SaaS startup with tools for growth hackers to grow their email list. We successfully took a few pre-orders and validated the idea before the product was even ready.It\u2019s especially difficult for SaaS entrepreneurs because the outside world feels that since our service is digital it should be easy to give out free accounts (they never factor in hosting, AWS, customer service, dev costs, and the time we\u2019ve just spent helping you get on-boarded).So HOW do you actually charge your early customers without coming off as a douchebag?First off, you should make a clear distinction between 2 groups of beta users.There are some beta users who basically are just doing you a favor and aren\u2019t really getting much out of your software at all. For these guys I generally don\u2019t pay attention to them and don\u2019t actively try to collect money from them.There are beta users who are actively using the platform and seem to be getting a lot of value from it.You want to be focusing on group 2.How to go for the ask, politely.Pre-development stage: Use Celery to take pre-orders, make sure the customer has purchase intent.When you go looking for pre-orders, be very specific. After you give your pitch, say \u201cis this something you want, and what would you pay for it?\u201dIf you get a yes, then send them a Celery page which asks for their money. This app make it really easy to start accepting pre-orders, and your customer won\u2019t get charged until you have a product. Make sure you emphasize this point with your customer, especially if you still have 6\u201312 months of development left.Another point of emphasis is that you want to let them know there is a reason why you\u2019re asking for their CC. It\u2019s not to take their money and run, but you need enough commitments so that you know this is an idea worth developing, because it\u2019s going to take a lot of your time.Also let your customer know they\u2019re getting a great deal for being an early customer. I recommend giving each of these customers a lifetime account so you don\u2019t have to worry about porting that user in as a monthly subscriber when the time comes.Know that you\u2019re going to get a ton of flakes at this stage. People are gonna give you every excuse in the book to not pay you. But you NEED this pre-validation to know whether this is a software idea that you can really pursue.Noah Kagan, the CEO of SumoMe and AppSumo, says you should be able to get 3 paying customers within 48 hours to validate your idea. That might not be possible for everyone, but I\u2019d say give yourself a month to get 3 pre-orders, BEFORE you start coding up your next SaaS app. This will both give you a nice little deadline while also testing the market and seeing if this is something that people actually want. It\u2019s better to lose a month of pre-validation then 6 months coding up your solution to absolute crickets.You\u2019re likely going to get a few people that are right on the cusp of wanting to pay for your software, but they want to see it in action first. Don\u2019t worry, keep these people in your sales queue and hit them up back when you have your early working prototype.How do you even GET people to talk to for pre-orders?Go to events where your target customer might reside and talk to everyone. Don\u2019t ask for the sale right there, just get a meeting.Ask in Facebook groups & Slack chats if \u201canyone is having trouble with X\u201d then add those people as friends. Then explain your solution to them.Basically your pre-orders is all about RELATIONSHIPS. Even before you start your email list, start build relationships now!Of course having an email list obviously helps, the more people that know you, the more people that you could potentially market to.Working prototype stage (beta testing): Be upfront. Tell them you\u2019re trying to validate your idea and you need their money. At the same time, hand-hold them and provide a lot of free value through your time.Those people that were wishy washy at the pre-development stage, here\u2019s where you can wow them and get them into your app.It\u2019s important that you show your app for free first. Mention that you want to show them exactly how your software works and really guide them through it 1-on-1.Let them know transparently that you want their honest feedback about whether they would purchase your software, and if they wouldn\u2019t that\u2019s totally cool.After your user has been inside your app, you can kind of see whether they\u2019ve gotten on-boarded and have gotten value from your software. The key here is now that someone has gotten on-boarded and really like your app, they\u2019re gonna WANT to pay you.Give them a discount for being your friends/early customers. We did this for a couple of our early beta users and they all were cool with paying a substantially discounted price for access to our app.This is good when your early beta users are all people that are fairly close to you, like friends and acquaintances.Another approach: Put up a paywall after X amount of months and let your beta users know.The early version of our software didn\u2019t have any paywall. Eventually we added the paywall and made it so that users had to pay in order to access certain features of our software. When that happens you should email your beta customers and let them know that you\u2019re finally charging for the product and they can get a discount.This is more effective when you have a good number of beta users who aren\u2019t necessarily your friends. This not only activates your current free beta users to pay for your product, but it also does it in a way where your beta users feel good about getting a discount.How do you respond when they ask for your software for free?One issue that I faced when I ended up charging some close friends was they asked me, \u201chey dude, can you hook me up with a free account?\u201dBut my script that I came up with was basically this:Tell them we\u2019re in the process of business validation, and we need people to pay for the service so we know that it\u2019s something to continue with.But at the same time, you\u2019d like to give them a highly discounted lifetime account so they don\u2019t have to pay monthly fees for this.Lastly, if they really make a big deal out of it and don\u2019t want to pay for it, then just give it to them for free.For me, I chose to give some accounts for free because these were literally my best buds and I didn\u2019t think it was really worth fussing over.ConclusionThere\u2019s basically a general formula to the madness here.Give a reason why you need to take their money.Give them an offer.These 2 steps are both incredibly important because it frames the ask in the right way for your customer. Instead of thinking, \u201cOh, he\u2019s such a jerk for asking me to pay, even though I did XY and Z for them!\u201d your early user now thinks, \u201cCool, I\u2019m getting to support this entrepreneur while also getting a discount.

Multiple smart contract languages are at the bleeding edge of innovation in competition to become mainstream. In addition to the well-known \u201cSolidity\u201d, there are several experimental languages targeting Ethereum:Bamboo \u2014 A morphing smart contract language (Not actively developed)Vyper \u2014 New experimental pythonic programming language (Actively developed)LLL \u2014 Low-level Lisp-like Language (Not actively developed)Flint \u2014 New language under development with security features including asset types, state transition, and safe integers (Actively developed)Pyramid \u2014 A dialect of the Scheme programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). (Not actively developed)What is Vyper?Vyper is an experimental smart contract language. It aims for simplicity, human readability, and security. Also, Vyper\u2019s syntax resembles Python.\u201cVyper is a contract-oriented, pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\u201dLanguage Goals of VyperSimplicity \u2014 Vyper focuses on simplicity and maximizes the chances of writing error-free code. Its compiler implementation also strives for simplicity.Security & Audibility \u2014 Building secure contract comes naturally, that's what Vyper aims for; the code should have a natural reading flow for any reader. That's why Vyper encourages building one-page smart contracts. Code readability provides for better code audibility.Vyper Vs. SolidityVyper\u2019s goals as a language are different than those of Solidity. To achieve simplicity, readability, and audibility, Vyper doesn\u2019t include some of Solidity\u2019s features such as Modifiers and Inheritance. In addition, Vyper also doesn\u2019t include:Function overloadingOperator overloading (Solidity also doesn't support it as of 17 Jan 2018)Recursive callingInfinite-length loopsInline assemblyBinary fixed pointVyper scarifies all of the above to achieve it's design goals. However, Vyper does provide some interesting features :Bounds and overflow checking: On array accesses as well as on arithmetic level, which improves performance and increases reliability and security.Support for signed integers and decimal fixed point numbersDecidability: It should be possible to compute a precise upper bound for the gas consumption of any function call.Strong typing: Including support for units (e.g. timestamp, timedelta, seconds, wei, wei per second, meters per second squared).Small and understandable compiler codeLimited support for pure functions: Anything marked constant is not allowed to change the state.Among the above, decidability is a very important feature which you can use to estimate your upper bound of gas usage. This can help in gas optimization, which is a very important part of a smart contract platform.Installing VyperLet\u2019s get to it and install Vyper now. If you are running MacOS, check instructions here (I am running Ubuntu 16.10).Note- Vyper is in active development, so don\u2019t lose patience if you get installation errors. \ud83d\ude03Install Pythonsudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install python3.6sudo apt-get install python3-devCreate Virtual EnvironmentIf you have worked with Python before then you must know about Virtual Python environment. It is strongly recommended to install Vyper in a Virtual Python environment.To create a new virtual environment for Vyper run the following commands:sudo apt install virtualenvvirtualenv -p python3.6 --no-site-packages ~/vyper-venvsource ~/vyper-venv/bin/activateYou must still be in the Virtual environment\u2026 now let\u2019s install Vyper:git clone https://github.com/ethereum/vyper.gitcd vypermakemake testIf everything went fine, then first thank to Byte God \ud83d\ude03 and compile an example contract:vyper examples/crowdfund.vyThere are many examples in the example folder of the installation directory. We\u2019ll be going deeper into Vyper usage in future articles, so remember to hit subscribe below!Truffle with VyperTruffle 5 launched recently and it includes Vyper support.

Say, you\u2019ve lost your wallet and you need money to get a bus ticket. Which technique do you think will work better with strangers?Scenario 1You walk up to a strangerAnd say \u201cHey, I need money for the bus\u201d.Scenario 2You walk up to a strangerAnd say \u201cHey, how\u2019s it going? Sorry to bother you, I\u2019m in a bit of a pickle and you seem like a genuinely decent person and that is why I\u2019m asking you. So this is the situation\u2026 \u201dWhich attempt do you think will work out better?It\u2019s definitely the latter.Staying ColdA lot of email marketers have in fact chosen the first route.They don\u2019t put their heart into it, they don\u2019t do their homework and they want quick results. A lot of outreach folk also do not segment their audience or truly understand their audience\u2019s pain.This is why cold email outreach has got a reputation of being a difficult channel to get business from.Without the initial hard work, the people you reach out to will remain cold.When they don\u2019t get the results, they start complaining and they spell doom for the entire Industry. They usually write a post about how Email Marketing is dead because it didn\u2019t work for them.Warming things upAnd over the years, in an attempt to be professional, a lot of cold emailers have stuck to a script and have completely avoided any informal talk. You should know how important informal talk is. One of the reasons languages were developed was because of people\u2019s need to gossip.If you stick to your robotic script, it\u2019s going to go nowhere. Here is an example of a chat conversation with a potential customer. We got talking about cities and the world and after a long conversation, a rapport was built.I\u2019m not saying, fake the rapport. Be genuine. And don\u2019t be a robot. You don\u2019t have to become Facebook buddies with every customer. But it helps to form a bond.So at Find That Email, we use a few techniques for warming up a lead during outreach. Here are some ideas that you could use.5 Ways to Go From Cold to HOT!Idea #1 : You are part of our same Facebook group.Have you ever been in a situation, where you were interacting with a stranger and they happen to mention that they are from the same city as yours and your interest in them piqued?There\u2019s something about being from the same tribe or group that warms people up immediately.It\u2019s the same thing with marketing, when you mention that you are from a particular Linkedin or Facebook group that they are part of and that is why you are reaching out to them, It immediately makes them at ease.Here is a sample idea.Hey Joe,I\u2019m John Doe from Sweet Candy Tech. I see you are part of the SAAS Hacks group. It\u2019s a great group isn\u2019t it? Considering both of us are in the same group, I\u2019ve made a tiny assumption that we we might be interested in the same things\u2026This is something we have constantly used at Find That Email with a good amount of success.Idea #2 : Common Friends with the Rock.This actually requires a common friend.It\u2019s pretty easy to make common friends. A few people on Linkedin do accept requests from strangers that they\u2019ve interacted with a total of zero times. This is not a good common friend.Here are a few techniques to make good common friends.Ask your existing friends to introduce you to people you want to knowMeet, interact, exchange ideas with people in events and meetups. Keep in touch with them on Social Media. They become your connections.There are a few high quality facebook groups which put out posts like \u201cIntroduce yourself and share your Linkedin and connect with other people on the group\u201d. Take advantage of this and reach out to people you would like in your network. That\u2019s another way of adding more contacts.So when you make connections with 10 people and they have an average of 450 people in their contacts. That\u2019s 4500 people you could possibly reach and use the common connection card.So now if you have a common friend, ask them to introduce you. Simple. Getting introductions is the best way to do partnerships and will probably the best way for a very long time.Idea #3 : The Event CardThis is a situational based warming up technique, but it works nevertheless.Say you are attending an event and you are aware of your prospect attending the event as well. You can set-up a meeting at the booth, by mailing them before the event.Hey <Name of the person>,I\u2019m Joe from Supertronics. I see you\u2019re going to be attending the SaasX event this August. I have a few interesting ideas to share with you about <topic>. Would you be interested in a chat?The other is, mailing them after an event is over and when you did not meet them.Hey <Name of the person>,I\u2019m Joe from Supertronics. I know you had attended the SaasX even this August and I wanted to come to your booth to say hi and discuss a few ideas, but I missed you by a whisker because I had an emergency. Would you be willing to chat?Idea #4 : Doing Research and Getting FeedbackA smart technique that you could use to warm up your potential lead is to ask for feedback for your research.An example would be :Find That Email is an email finding tool and say we decide to write an article about how lead generation companies can get better at getting the accurate emails and the issues companies have with lead generation companies.You can ask a potential lead their opinion on lead generation companies and how these companies can improve their service.A lot of folk will have opinions, especially if they are the right target audience and they will give you advice and tips. This is your in and you can start a conversation around the tools they use and so on.Hey Tim,This is Jody from Forest Fire Inc. You seem to be an accomplished sales representative based on your profile and I reached out to you for advice. I\u2019m writing an article on <topic>, can I have your opinion and and suggestions to improve <topic>.Idea #5 : I\u2019m a FanIn many cases, the people you are reaching out to have written content and are maybe influencers.One of the ways you can warm them up is by telling them that you\u2019ve read their content and have already shared it on your social media and to your followers.Considering you\u2019ve already done something for them, many people will treat your cold email with a bit more of warmth.I loved your article so much, I\u2019ve already shared it to my followers on Social Media and to people on my mailing list. It was AMAZING.Another way to warm up the lead is to find the Influencer that they really like. Look at their twitter, social media and find the person that they are big fans of and share a similar interest as well.Finding common ground with people is the fastest way to get people to like you.Finally I\u2019ve found a fan of <Influencer Name>, who is a bigger fan than me. I love his ideas. Which strategy that <Influencer> suggested was your favorite?Just to make things clear. These ideas aren\u2019t the only things that should be in the Email. Your email should encompassa solid introductiona reason for reaching outa strong value propositiona call to actionand your warming messageWrapping it up!You need to turn on your charm when it comes to cold emails.If you put your thinking cap on, you can come up with various ways to warm up your prospects in a cold email.Get on your experiment mode and find your technique.Also, one technique isn\u2019t guaranteed to work with everybody. You should know your audience and use the right strategy.

It\u2019s intimidating and confusing sometimes. I get that.I run userinput.io, which provides on-demand feedback on websites and business ideas, so I\u2019ve seen a LOT of questions asked. Sometimes when I look over orders that come through (out of curiosity or to spot-check the feedback), I cringe at the bad questions that I see. But the golden questions, those can really help you improve.Six crucial user feedback questions1) What do you think this site offers?This question is similar to the \u201cfive second blink test\u201d where you have someone glance at a site quickly, then tell you what it\u2019s about. If it\u2019s not clear right away, then you need to change something. Or a lot of things.By asking what the site offers, you\u2019re no longer assuming that the offer of the site is clear, and you\u2019re testing to see if a regular visitor \u201cgets it\u201d right away. And you\u2019ll be surprised of the confusion that can come out of this question.If you\u2019re on the right track with your copywriting and how you present everything, 90+% of respondents will understand what your site\u2019s about.But pay attention to everyone who doesn\u2019t understand the offer and pour over what they say.What are they misinterpreting? What was unclear? What led them to the inaccurate idea of the offer?Presenting your offer as clearly and simply (and enticingly) as possible is so important for conversion, and keeping people on your site. You of course totally understand your offer, but it\u2019s vital to step back and have other people try to explain your own offer to see where your site falls short.2) Do you trust this site? Why or why not?I don\u2019t like yes or no questions for surveys, but the second question here of \u201cwhy or why not\u201d makes it all worthwhile. Trust is such a huge factor in site activity, bounce rate, conversion, time on site, checkout, everything.This gets back to the point about the offer above. You of course trust your site. You trust yourself! You\u2019re not some scammer scumbag, you\u2019re a legit person with a legit site. Obviously!But do visitors trust your site?Maybe it\u2019s the overall design. I ran feedback on one of my own sites the other day, and one reviewer said they didn\u2019t trust my site because the design \u201clooked a bit out-dated.\u201d Trust is fickle. People are fickle. The design isn\u2019t that outdated in my opinion, of course. The site is built on a tremendously popular Wordpress plugin. But that one reviewer thought it looked out-dated, and maybe he\u2019s right, maybe it\u2019s not as elegant and modern as it could be. And that could affect him converting and being a customer.They\u2019ll pick up on other stuff, good and bad. Those who do trust your site will say \u201cI see the padlock in the address bar, I like that\u201d or \u201cYeah it looks professional and your team page has pictures and I like that a lot.\u201dOr maybe they will say \u201cNo way, it looks like a pyramid scheme\u201d but they\u2019ll explain why. And the why is the crucial part that you can learn from and execute on and come up with a plan to improve with.You\u2019re too blind to your own design, so you have to ask others, unbiased others, to tell you why your site is trustworthy. Or not.3) If you had a magic wand, how would you improve the site?This is a straight up customer discovery question, one that would be used more in the context of \u201cIf you had a magic wand, how would you make international travel easier?\u201d or whatever, in the process of trying to figure out what problem to solve with a new idea or startup.But the question is gold for site feedback too. Some people laugh at this question, because it\u2019s kinda corny. But it\u2019s gold, Jerry, gold!The great thing about the \u201cmagic wand\u201d question is that it gives reviewers free reign to dream, and say whatever they want. Their gears will turn, and it\u2019ll turn yours too. Some of the responses may not be possible (\u201cMake it free!!\u201d) but you\u2019ll get ideas for new features and different approaches.When I ran a survey on my other business, which is a screen printing company, I ran it specifically on the page for bands who want custom shirts, and there were lots of fairly common answers like \u201cmore images\u201d and \u201cmore testimonials\u201d, but two respondents gave me a couple great ideas, including that I should push our graphic design services more, which I hadn\u2019t thought to do, and combine them with the band offer more clearly.A magic wand can lead to a lot of new ideas.4) What confused you most about this site?There\u2019s a recurring theme here, but your own site can\u2019t confuse you because you built it. You\u2019re too wrapped up in it.Is the pricing confusing? Listen to your reviewers and learn how to change it.Is the offer confusing? Learn why.Do they not understand why a certain feature is there? Or why they would want it?Maybe the offer is confusing because of how it\u2019s laid out. (A reviewer for my site told me to frame the information in a table format instead, to make it easier to digest.)How long does your process take? What happens first? What are the overall steps in the process?Maybe they don\u2019t understand how to check out, or get started, or order.You totally understand your site. Your visitors may not. Find out why, and then fix it.5) What is the site missing?What\u2019s not there, that the visitors think should be there? Another variation of this question that I like is \u201cWhat did you expect to see here, that isn\u2019t here?\u201dThese questions let people tell you what they would expect to see on a site like yours. Maybe it\u2019s testimonials. Maybe it\u2019s social proof. Or images of the team. Or a clearer offer. Or probably it\u2019s something very specific to your site, so I can\u2019t even imagine what it would be, and list it as an example.Answers to this question can also lead you onto what could be included in order to help improve conversion.6) What is your least favorite thing about the site?I also sometimes run the question \u201cwhat\u2019s your favorite thing about the site?\u201d because it\u2019s nice to see what people really like, but honestly, negative feedback is better than positive, so you need to find out what people don\u2019t like, and if you\u2019re lucky, you might find someone who really shreds your site, so that you get a list of a ton of things that should be improved.\u201cEverything looks great, no complaints\u201d is worthless feedback. They need to find something they don\u2019t like. And they\u2019ll let you know, whether it\u2019s your color scheme or logo or how you wrote the copy. I\u2019ve had people shred the popups on my sites before, ranting about how annoying they are. You won\u2019t know until you ask.I mentioned improving site copy above, but none of the questions relate. So what questions cover that? It\u2019s more about using the verbiage that the reviewers use, and you can also explore their fears with feedback questions, by asking things like \u201cWhat\u2019s the hardest thing about X?\u201d Pour over what they really say, and then use their own words in your copy. Speak to their needs and concerns.I was running feedback on that band merch page, and one reviewer said this in an answer \u201cWe were afraid of spending a lot of money and then being stuck with a bunch of merchandise since there is often a high minimum order\u201d when asked about ordering shirts before. There\u2019s actually a lot there for me to use in the site copy, by saying that my solution of fundraising with shirts helps avoid spending a lot upfront and getting stuck with shirts that no one wants. And I also learned to emphasize our relatively low minimum order too.Four awful questions that should be avoidedWhat not to ask and how not to ask it. When you\u2019re getting feedback, you need it to be valuable, insightful and actionable. There are ways to shape questions to make them bear more fruit. And there are also ways to shape questions to make them rotten.Here are some tips to avoid bad questions.Awful: Would you buy/use this?This is an awful question for a couple of reasons, one major reason being that you never want to ask a \u201cyes/no\u201d question because you want way more than \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d as an answer. You want detail and depth and an explanation. \u201cYes/no\u201d limits you right from the beginning, and screws up your potential for learning something that matters. \u201cYes I would buy this\u201d is nice to feel like you\u2019re on the right track, but it\u2019s still too limiting, and you also don\u2019t know WHY they would buy it. If you\u2019re going to ask a question like this, make it a two part question with \u201cwhy or why not?\u201d added on, for the real valuable info.The other reason it\u2019s a lousy question is that people taking surveys may be within your target market, and they may be within your audience, but you can\u2019t count on them to be your customers. I believe payment is validation, but this is not the time to see if they would pay.That being said, there is plenty of value to \u201cWould you use this? Why or why not?\u201d which removes the payment question, and lets you gauge the desirability of the offer, and also find out what features make it desirable and more importantly what keeps people from wanting it.A customer ran this question on an app she\u2019s working on the other day, and I reviewed her answers. It was pretty polarized, with some people hating the idea, and some people loving the idea. She ran the good version of the question with the \u201cwhy or why not\u201d part, and got tons of feedback on what people liked and what they extremely disliked on the idea.Asking \u201cwhy or why not?\u201d makes the feedback valuable. But don\u2019t just ask a \u201cyes/no\u201d question.Awful: Do you like this website?Again, not valuable enough. A \u201cyes\u201d is flattering, but you don\u2019t know why they like it. A \u201cno\u201d is meaningless because you\u2019re just going to be bummed they didn\u2019t like your site and you have no idea what they disliked and how you can improve it.There are better versions of this answer:\u201cWhat do you like most about this site?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think of the branding, design and appearance of this site?\u201d \u201cWhat do you dislike most about this site?\u201dAny of those questions will give you helpful feedback, way more helpful than a binary response with no clarification.Awful: How would you rate this website on a scale from 1 to 10?I am not a fan of Net Promoter Score or any system like it because it has no depth and detail and because it\u2019s not actionable at all.If someone gives your site a \u201c1\u201d, whatever. If they give it a \u201c10\u201d, whatever. Did you learn anything from those numbers? Sort of but not really. You don\u2019t know why they gave it a 1, or a 10, or anything in between. You have no actionable feedback here, so you can\u2019t take action. See the previous question and ask something that you can actually learn from.Awful: What would you pay for this?Again, these survey takes may be within your target demographic, but they\u2019re not customers or leads or in your sales funnel or anything. They\u2019re just taking a survey.Well, I take that back a little bit. If you were suave enough to get someone on your mailing list / waiting list to take a survey about your startup / idea / business, then they are in fact a potential customer. But it\u2019s really hard to talk someone from a waiting list into taking a survey, at least in my experience. You gotta bribe them somehow. Or develop personal relationships with them a bit, and ask questions one by one, not so much in a survey format.But the main reason this question sucks it that people who are getting paid a small amount of money to take a survey are not probably in a position to buy your service or product anyway. By the nature of paid surveys, those taking the survey may skew towards having less income or at least less disposable income.I quit asking this question a while ago when doing customer discovery surveys, after guys said they wouldn\u2019t pay anything, or just some really small amount for an online dating related startup I had, while customers would pay $39 or even $149 for the services.These surveys can be great to explore ideas, validate needs, and improve your website by easily learning the weak areas. They\u2019re insightful and easy, and I love them. The formation of the question is key, so spend time giving them thought.Also, make sure the questions are clear, and not at all misleading. I\u2019ve seen customers run a survey question (and I\u2019ve done it myself) where the question was not written very clearly, and it really affected the answers. You can end up getting feedback that isn\u2019t at all about what you asked, if your question is unclear.That\u2019s it. I hope this was helpful.What would you rate this article on a scale from 1 to 10?Just kidding. That question is garbage.Check out userinput.io to learn how to improve your website or idea today.Originally published at VYPER.", "responses": 1, "tags": []}, {"title": "Top Facebook Groups To Join", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/top-facebook-groups-to-join-1d40f4471c85?source=search_post---------7", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2016-10-13", "last_modified_date": "2017-10-16", "readtime": "1.91", "claps": 5, "voters": 4, "content": "Top Facebook Groups To JoinVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowOct 13, 2016 \u00b7 2 min readWell all know how important niche groups (especially Facebook) are when it comes to content marketing.Being part of a small targeted community is a great way to gain exposure for your own posts, tools, products or any other content you may be trying to promote.Having just said how cool groups and communities are there are a sh*t load of them.

Because if you just join 30 groups and just spam your contest, you\u2019re going to get banned faster than you can say, \u201cEnter my contest!\u201dHere\u2019s a detailed explanation on how to do it WITHOUT getting banned. A lot of credit to Kim of RunnerCrate, who used this tactic very successfully for her giveaway.Step 1: Find the Group and Make Sure it\u2019s ActiveThere\u2019s no point in posting in groups where the spammers have taken over. Find an active, legitimate group in your niche where people are actually helping each other. Don\u2019t go for the groups where you see a bunch of people just posting links without much discussion, as these groups have gone to sh*t.The simple way to do it is search for a keyword, for example, \u201crunners\u201d and then click on the groups tab.Step 2: Post & EngageBefore you just post your giveaway, make sure you post & engage heavily with the members. This step needs to be done a week or so before your giveaway, so you can build some good karma in the community. Be super helpful and eager and show that you\u2019re going to be a valued member of the community.This goes a long way to impressing the admins. Don\u2019t post any of your links at ALL during your first week or two, because admins can see that a mile away.Step 3: Find the Admin, Befriend ThemAgain, here\u2019s a gif showing you how to find the admins of the group. Again this is from Kim\u2019s RunnerCrate blog.Take some time to get to know the admins. Most of the time, these guys are sharing a lot of content in their own groups. Try and engage with them if you can. Make it known that you\u2019re a real person, not just some bot trying to spam Facebook groups.Aaron Janx, a podcaster, uses groups extremely effectively. To befriend admins he does a public thank you to them. Here\u2019s an example of how he thanks the admin of the Screw the 9\u20135 Facebook group, Jill Stanton.Notice how in the post he never linked to his own content, but linked to the content of the group owners. Admins love this because it\u2019s a testimonial to their work. You bet that Aaron now has free reign inside that Facebook group to subtly promote his own stuff. He also wrote a very long note in the Facebook group instead of a simple thank you. This kind of \u201csucking up\u201d is key to making the admins love you.Step 4: Ask the Admins to Share for You, with an IncentiveIt\u2019s 10x more powerful if the admin themselves shares your contest or giveaway.If you REALLY want them to share it for you, I recommend giving them some kind of free gift as a bribe. Kim from RunnerCrate offered up free boxes in exchange for having them post her contest. It can work without the bribe if you ask nicely, but for the larger Facebook groups, this tactic could be a game changer for you.And there you have it. That\u2019s how you work the Facebook groups and get your contest shared without being spammy.Ready to create your contest and start sharing it in Facebook groups?Get a free account at VYPER!Originally published at VYPER.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "How to Use Content Upgrades to Increase Your Content Marketing Opt-ins by 60%", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/how-to-use-content-upgrades-to-increase-your-content-marketing-opt-ins-by-60-a3572c662f26?source=search_post---------9", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2016-12-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-02-16", "readtime": "3.83", "claps": 2, "voters": 2, "content": "How to Use Content Upgrades to Increase Your Content Marketing Opt-ins by 60%VYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowDec 13, 2016 \u00b7 4 min readWhat You Are About To Learn:What content upgrades areWhy content upgrades are better than popupsStep by Step guide on how to create / use content upgradesBonus lists and resources on content marketingWhat the \u201cF\u201d are Content UpgradesSo you know collecting emails on your blog is important but struggling to make ends meet!

We spent months getting all antsy about it because we really REALLY wanted to get on. We didn\u2019t even know if our product was \u201cgood enough\u201d to get featured, but it was.It turned out to be a pretty straightforward process that I\u2019ll detail for you.Create a list of startups similar to yours that were successfully hunted on Product Hunt. Look for startups that got 200+ upvotes. You can search by \u201ctopics\u201d to find similar startups.Make a list of the hunters that submitted those products, with a spreadsheet, and find their email addresses. Get at least 5, if not 10.If you can\u2019t find enough hunters doing this, try adding the top hunters from this list \u2014 http://makersuccess.com/leaderboard \u2014 A lot of these hunters aren\u2019t super selective about what they hunt. If you need a connect, I can intro you to some of the top hunters as long as you email me kevin@vyper.ioCheck to make sure their other submissions get on average 150+ upvotes \u2014 this signals a good hunter.Send them a brief cold email (I\u2019d email 1 or 2 per day, instead of all of them at the same time, this way if you get a hunter you don\u2019t have to bother other people), something like this:Hey <name>,I noticed you hunt a lot for Product Hunt and you submitted <XXX startup> product. We have a similar product that allows you to create gorgeous viral contests that generate email leads.I\u2019d truly appreciate it if you could hunt my startup for me.

The VYPER blog has been increasing at a rate of 77% growth month over month, and one of the main reasons is because we\u2019ve started writing more content while promoting it in the right places.Here\u2019s a checklist that I personally use during my blog planning, creation, and promotion phase.Free Bonus Download: Grab the post checklist as a PDF! and reference it at your convenience!Phase 1: PlanningWhat topic should I write about?Some marketers tell you to check BuzzSumo to find relevant topics or search for relevant SEO terms before you start writing. I disagree. I think the best content comes from personal experience and writing from the heart, not from finding topics from these sites. What do I know about getting articles that work? My last online magazine (Amped Asia) to over 4 million monthly pageviews. Granted, it\u2019s a little bit different now that I\u2019m writing for a SaaS company rather than an entertainment magazine, but a lot of the same principles for good writing applies.So instead of writing your next piece for the search engines or to fit in with what\u2019s hot, why not think one step ahead? What are people NOT talking about and can you start a discussion around it? What are people saying and is there a way you can disagree with them or form a counter-point? (Like what I just did here). You CAN use BuzzSumo, but make sure you\u2019re using to to find inspiration, not to just copy the top-most shared content.What\u2019s the goal of this piece and how will I accomplish my goal?Why are you even writing this blog post? Every blogger and content marketer should have a goal in mind for their piece, and use that goal to guide how they write. If you can quantify your goal that would be best, but it\u2019s okay if you can\u2019t.For example my goals with the blog post you\u2019re reading.Add 100 people to our subscriber list.Exercise my writing skills with long form content.Show off VYPER\u2019s new content upgrades tool.Find content that resonates with the audiences at GrowthHackers / Inbound.And how am I going to accomplish my goal?I\u2019m going to link to a content upgrade, one of the best ways to promote a blog post.I\u2019m going to make this piece over 2,500 words long.The tool is displayed prominently within the article and linked to.Goes hand in hand with #2, but I\u2019m making this piece very long-form and detailed.Is this topic something that I can write extensively in and something I have actual knowledge of?Blogging is great, but most bloggers are just rehashing content that they read elsewhere. But the best articles on the web are ones written with authenticity and voice. For example, even when Noah Kagan writes about something I might not be super interested in (like last week his newsletter was about how he had dinner with 2 people at his house\u2026 weird I know) I still read it because I just like him as a writer. Same with Neville Medhora (copywriting), Rob Walling (SaaS), and certain other influencers.So with that in mind, you want to make sure the topic you\u2019re writing about isn\u2019t just something you researched just for the article. You want to make sure you\u2019ve had personal experience. Case studies do super well because they show numbers and evidence that a certain tactic works.Once I know my content, can I fit it into any keywords for SEO?Now once you\u2019ve got a topic in mind, you should look into fitting SEO keywords into your article rather than the other way around. Don\u2019t force it though. You want the article to still come off natural. With the latest Google updates, it\u2019s much better to write a quality piece rather than write a piece with the aim of stuffing keywords into the article. HOWEVER, if you can naturally fit keywords into your article then do it.Can I mention any tools or resources in my post?For me, I look to include as many tools or resources into any post that I write. This allows me to potentially connect with the creator of that tool or get some friendly back and forth going.But really this helps you do 2 things.Directly you can get Tweets or shares by the company you mentioned. Some of them will even be shouting your praises at the top of their lungs.You build rapport and possibly a relationship with the creator of the tool/resource. You never know when this might be useful in the future.Free Bonus Download: Grab the post checklist as a PDF! and reference it at your convenience!Phase 2: CreationWrite a first draft. Wait a day to look it over.Write your first draft, but wait before you publish. I like to wait a day before I publish the article.Can I link to any previously written content?The more links you have to other articles in your blog bank, the more traffic you\u2019re going to eventually get. This is magnified when you re-purpose the same content for LinkedIn, Medium, etc.How can I 10x the value of this content?This is something I\u2019m doing more and more on the VYPER blog. Long-form content and huge guides are always your best bet because these rank well for SEO keywords and they get shared if they\u2019re especially epic. It\u2019s much harder to write long-form content, but if you can do it, you\u2019re going to have a huge advantage. That\u2019s why blogs like Grow and Convert have been killing it with content \u2014 the owner Benji is willing to write INSANE amounts of in-depth content backed by data.This stage is really the make or break point for your content. Average writers stop before they 10x their content.In a world where there is a lot of content getting passed around and not much content that\u2019s actually good, it takes the extra mile to have your content really stick with your audience. So when you think of it in that perspective, it\u2019s not hard to make content marketing work, you just need to be within the 1\u20132% that really goes that extra mile with your writing.Create a content upgrade for my piece of content.A content upgrade is a blog-specific lead magnet that is very closely related to the blog post. You can simply create a PDF version of your blog post and use that as a content upgrade. I like to add bonus content to my blog post and then combine my post + the bonus content into one PDF download.I use our in-house tool, VYPER Content Upgrades, to deliver the lead magnet and show a popup that asks for the email address. When you have a blog that has multiple content upgrades, this tool is very powerful to make it easier to setup multiple lead magnets on your blog. With providers like Mailchimp, you can only send a default \u201cwelcome\u201d email. That makes it hard to do content upgrades unless you\u2019re going to link to every single content upgrade inside that welcome email. Then you run into the problem of your reader getting the same welcome email multiple times when they find new content upgrades on your website. It gets messy. VYPER content upgrades handles this all for you AND incentivizes your reader to share the content upgrade in order to get bonus content.Where can I add numbers / evidence?People love proof. This is the reason why Nate Silver\u2019s blog FiveThirtyEight has been taking off despite talking about a topic (sports) that we don\u2019t always associate with hard evidence and numbers (he also talks about politics, but I mainly go on there for sports). It\u2019s such a smart blog because he backs up everything with charts and numbers, and he\u2019s really become the talk of the town in the sports blogging world. It\u2019s completely different from the coverage on places like ESPN and Bleacher Report.Re-think your headline.If your headline is something like \u201cThe Guide to Social Media Marketing\u201d \u2014 then scrap that sh*t and come up with something new. Make it exciting, make it lively, make it fresh. I like Neville Medhora\u2019s blog on copywriting for tips on this.My iteration for the headline for this blog post wasThe Ultimate Blog Promotion ChecklistThe Blog Promotion Checklist that Grew Our Traffic 77% (added numbers)The \u201c4-Phase\u201d Blog Promotion Checklist That Grows Our Traffic 77% Every Month (added a word with quotes to add intrigue)Phase 3: PromotionSend it to your newsletter, and ask them to share it with their friends.Activate your current audience to read your post and share it with their friends, thereby spreading your content virally.Did I mention anyone in the blog post? If so, contact them, tweet them, etc.Like I\u2019ve said already, cold outreach to the people in the blog post can help you get comments, get views, and get engagement. Ideally you\u2019ll want these people to share it with their networks.Re-purpose for Medium.Medium has an official plugin for this. I haven\u2019t cracked the code on Medium yet, so I\u2019ll probably follow-up this blog post with more when I figure out how to use Medium properly. This is one of the growth channels I\u2019m currently looking into.Re-purpose for LinkedIn.Great for posts that are business oriented. I don\u2019t think too much about this channel, I just get about 20\u201350 hits per article by re-posting it here. Great because it\u2019s native content so LinkedIn helps give it a boost. Great when you have thousands of connections on LinkedIn that might be reading your content.Re-purpose for RedditReddit loves self-posts, which means don\u2019t just link to your blog post from Reddit (most subs consider that to be blog spam). Instead make a \u201cself post\u201d which is basically your blog post rewritten as a Reddit post. Remember how earlier I told you to link to other posts in your blog? Well here\u2019s where that comes in handy.Tip: Use Reddit converter to easily transform a blog post into Reddit formatting.Also read our other article on promoting via Reddit.Add it to my library on Recurpost (you can also use MeetEdgar) so my post keeps getting in my share queue.Typically I share 2\u20134 pieces of content per day on my multiple Twitter followings and Facebook pages. Recurpost also posts it into my Facebook group.Post it up in various Slack chats.There\u2019s communities for many topics nowadays. Most Slack chats have a channel or two for self-promotion. Post them in here when you have a new blog post. Here\u2019s a good list of Slack groups you can join.Post in various Facebook groups (if it\u2019s allowed).This is powerful if you can swing it. Most Facebook groups disallow posting content, but if you\u2019re friends with the admins you can usually swing it. Here\u2019s a blog post where I talk more about posting within Facebook groups.Post it on Hacker News.Still trying to get this one to work. Sometimes I get 1k+ visits, sometimes 50\u2013100. Either way it\u2019s free traffic so there\u2019s no reason NOT to post it up here. And you don\u2019t have to be tech-focused for this to work. My friend Bemmu Soponen uses Hacker News to get a lot of traffic to his subscription candy service, Candy Japan. Here\u2019s a post he made that got tons of traffic and shares.Post it in relevant other communities.Depending on your niche, you might have communities where you can post your content. For startups/marketing I post to GrowthHackers.com and Inbound.org as well as Hacker News and Reddit.Share on my personal Facebook.Seems like a no-brainer, but just share it on networks you have access to, like your own personal Facebook.Email link roundups.There\u2019s a new type of newsletter out these days which contain purely links to other sites. Find link roundups in your niche and try to get your post listed in those roundups.Put it into Triberr.My co-founder worked on this tactic, but Triberr is basically a community where you can share other people\u2019s posts and they\u2019ll share yours. Traffic exchange type site, but it works within niches like entrepreneurship, startups, etc. So you\u2019ll end up getting some relevant shares.Promote it on Quuu promote.If you want to put any budget into it, Quuu promote is great if you fit within their categories.Get on Twitter and tweet your post to relevant users.I use automation tool Audiense to automatically send a tweet when someone follows me. Usually it says something like, \u201cHey I just wrote this new blog post on X, would you give me your thoughts? Thanks!\u201d (In fact you might be reading this blog post because you got my Tweet).Phase 4: Evaluate (Months Later)If this all seems like hard work, it is! In fact it\u2019s hella hard, which is why most people don\u2019t do it.Anything that\u2019s ever been worthwhile has never been easy.That\u2019s also why IF you do decide to write amazing long-form content, you will end up reaping the rewards of it.Don\u2019t get discouraged!The first few times you post are not going to get you anywhere.But let\u2019s say you\u2019re reading this article a few months later after you\u2019ve already published a couple posts. It\u2019s not too late to re-purpose those posts and keep the benefit going.Find the posts that have gotten the most traction.Find the posts on your site that have done the best for you as a blogger. We use Google Analytics and search by landing page.Add these posts to an autoresponder for new subscribers.We use Drip to automatically send new subscribers a sequence of posts consisting of our best quality posts.Repurpose content into SlideShares.This is something that takes a while to do, which is why it\u2019s in the bonus phase. Wait until your content has died down a bit then turn it into a powerpoint slide for SlideShare. It\u2019s slow at first, but over time you can get 100s of views. I\u2019m working on this tactic currently, and my first SlideShare has gotten 71 views. Not great, but it\u2019s better than nothing and I\u2019m pretty sure it will scale as time goes on.Combine blog posts to create a killer lead magnet & then promote your lead magnet.I combined multiple blog posts in the past and turned it into one large lead magnet.Then I promoted this heavily over all the channels I just talked about. This was a tactic I did heavily at my last startup PhotoWhoa, which was a daily deals site for photographers.It was great because I didn\u2019t have to write new content, but I still got a lot of new emails. In fact we grew our email list by around 400 emails using this tactic.Here\u2019s an example lead magnet we made by combining a bunch of articles.In ConclusionContent marketing and blogging isn\u2019t just spray and pray.

It\u2019s never been easier to get an eCommerce store up and running. All someone needs is a Shopify store, Ali Express account, and the Oberlo plugin. Of course, this is the super simple version of setting up a store but you know what I mean. It\u2019s a lot easier than 10 years ago!Retail e-commerce sales worldwide from 2014 to 2021 (in billion U.S. dollars)(that\u2019s a lot of moola for the 12 million e-commerce stores active online according to lemonstand.com)It may be easier to create an eCommerce store these days but it\u2019s harder than ever to make your store stand out. Whether it be a drop shipped, handmade or custom manufactured product, the rules of marketing are all the same.It\u2019s fricken hard to win over someone\u2019s trust and convince them your product is the best and they should buy it from you.So why are some eCommerce store successful and other not?I\u2019ve been lucky enough to have see behind the scenes of dozens of eCommerce stores (successful and not), some doing over $100k in a day others at $100/day. The traits are similar for all the most successful store though.So, if you\u2019re involved with an eCommerce store and looking to scale, improve your ROI or position your store for a huge exit sale, make sure you these fundamentals tick off. There\u2019s 1 in particular that I\u2019m going to share some stats and figures on so you can replicate the same success.Most of the time a good eCommerce store will have.A niche that the owner or team understands in depth and is passionate aboutA great product (even better one that solves a time consuming or expensive problem)A website that converts 4\u20136% (depending on your average order value and product)Over 60% profit margin (Rev \u2014 COGS = Profit)A strong marketing team executing successful campaigns (people don\u2019t just \u201cfind\u201d you)Of course, there\u2019s a lot more that goes into this but these are some good places to start and if you can nail these 5 things, you will more than likely have a profitable eCommerce store.This article is going to focus on number 5 \u2014 how to execute successful marketing campaigns to grow your revenue, email list, and customer touch points (social media).There are multiple channels, tactics, and campaigns you can use likeContent MarketingEmail MarketingPaid AdvertisingViral Marketing / Growth HackingBut I know you\u2019re probably going to want the easiest and fastest results so we\u2019re going to focus on Viral Contest Marketing.WTF is that?A contest is when a brand offers a prize in exchange for the opportunity to contact all the entrants and request actions from them.Once a person enters the contest, the brand then asks them to complete actions to earn extra entries into the contest. The more entries someone has, the higher the chance of them winning is.This incentivization includes referring others, sharing the brands content and completing any other actions that are important to the brand.Here\u2019s an example contest \u2014 https://vyper.io/c/199Here\u2019s an example leaderboard contest \u2014 https://vyper.io/c/756Case Study, Stats & Results!The case study is going to focus on the company Brevite. Which is a backpack company created specifically for photographers.The PrizeMavic DroneBackpack for PhotographersRemember, the closer aligned your prize is your target markets interests, desires and wants, the more successful your contest will be.You want people to really want to win your prize so they are willing to share the contest, refer others and complete tasks that the brand sents.What the brand requested from entrantsEmail addressA follow on social mediaShare content (retweet, Facebook share, re-gram etc)Doesn\u2019t seem like a lot but, boy was it a LOT for this eCommerce store!Brevite Viral Contest MetricsInvestment: $3k (prize, ads etc.)Campaign length: 15 daysSign up conversion rate: ~65%Email GrowthStarting email list: 1,700Emails gathered: 41,000Emails harvested: 36,000 (after cleaning list)Around $0.08 an email address (clean emails)Social Media Growth6,300 followers on Instagram3,079 followers on Twitter4,954 page likes on FacebookThese stats do not even take into account the follow-up sales from all of these collected emails.Not many case studies will go into this amount of depth, so we want to thank Brevite for sharing their numbers.So now you know what the contest results were but how did they do it?The next section is going into how you can get similar results.Basic Contest Promotion Strategies:Choose a really good prize that aligns with your target audience.Share the contest constantly on social channels & in groups.Add the contest to your website. (use a banner or VYPER\u2019s CTA chat feature \u2014 example)Email your list multiple times.Send email updates on the contest (examples below)Announce the launch of contestFirst week, announce top 5 entrant scoresHalfway, new prizes addedNew bonus entry addedDouble points on all bonus entries for the next 48 hours7 days to go, keep sharing & collecting entries48 hours, time is running out24 hours, last chance contest endingSubmit to giveaway directories \u2014 List HereDesign really good share images so when all the entrants in the contest share it to earn entries others are interested.Advanced Contest Promotion Strategies:If you\u2019re partnering up, get the other company to share your contest.their social mediatheir social channelsadd to their websiteCreate a YouTube video on how to do something, a product review or unboxing then link to your contest.Get influences to share the giveaway.You can purchase a shout outCall in a favor from friends, family or co-workersPitch that they have a high chance to win the contest due to their large audience.Buy ads on Reddit, Facebook, Instagram etcBonus Tip \u2014 Incentivize people who enter your contest by giving them additional contest entries for liking, sharing and commenting on your ads. This increases your ad quality score due to high engagement and will generate better results.Pay or partner up with a publication or niche authorities. Get them to share your contest with their (usually cost is a CPM, CPC or Cost per lead):Email listFacebook groupSlack groupForumAnswer Quora questions on your niche and link to your contest.E.g. Brevite could answer questions about drones and link to their contest to win one.These strategies for promoting a contest are all optional.You can choose to do all of them, one of them or even none of them, either way when you start your contest, remember you get out what you put in!So, the more work you put into promoting a contest the better the results are going to be!You can run a contest and just tell your direct audience and they will refer their friends, family, and co-workers. The contest will still get some good results but the more people you put your contest in front of, the better your results will be.So, if you\u2019re looking for a new, innovative way to collect emails, get more followers and build your business, head over to VYPER!Have a contest of your own?

It\u2019s a place where you can get a lot of traffic for nothing except your time. Reddit gets 150 MILLION pageviews per month, so needless to say you can get TONS of free traffic.At the same time, Reddit is one of those places where self-promotion is very frowned upon. Any kind of marketing is frowned upon unless you put a VERY detailed and delicate touch to your posts. If you learn how to do that, you can promote your stuff without getting your posts deleted and without getting banned.I\u2019ve gotten my stuff deleted many times in the past. I can\u2019t even tell you how many times I\u2019ve gotten messages like the one below.If you\u2019re new to Reddit, you need to first familiarize yourself with the platform. This is probably one of the harder parts of promoting with this channel because it\u2019s like its own society with its own rules and markup language and lingo. This article by Mashable gives a great overview, so please take a read and learn the ins and outs of the platform before you try to utilize it.And note that Reddit is a LONG TERM channel. It\u2019s not something you can just do quickly. So don\u2019t expect to master Reddit marketing overnight just like you can\u2019t master Facebook ads overnight. Any channel that is worth it will be a channel that requires hard work, dedication, and a lot of trial and error.But once you\u2019ve become an adopted member of its society, you can really leverage it for tons of traffic. Here\u2019s a quick step-by-step rundown of how to make it work.1. Spend a whole month just posting on subreddits related to your niche, get 50+ karma.There\u2019s a subreddit for every topic. A lot of times there are multiple subreddits. Find the ones related to your brand and start getting as active as possible. Look for subreddits with over 50,000 members, as these will get you the most bang for your buck. If your niche doesn\u2019t have any of these subreddits, then just look for the ones that are as active as possible.You need to get some karma so Reddit knows you\u2019re not just on there to plug your thing and leave. Karma happens when you contribute meaningfully to discussions on the platform and it\u2019s a very organic thing. So don\u2019t just go on there and post one-word answers. You need to provide as much value as possible. What I like to do is to go into subreddits where I know a lot about the topic (like /r/entrepreneur) and just answer all the questions with deep meaningful answers.I\u2019ve read a lot of posts on the web that karma doesn\u2019t matter. Actually it does. The more karma you have the more legitimate your account seems and it\u2019ll prevent users from posting stuff saying you just came in here to spam your link and then leave.So DO try to get some karma, however, you don\u2019t need thousands of karma to make it work. Once you\u2019ve got some karma, maybe like 30\u201350ish karma, you\u2019re ready to actually promote your stuff.Also note that during this time there should not be a HINT of marketing at all in your posts. Just contribute as much as possible to the community and really learn the ins and outs of every subreddit. Note the patterns of what gets upvoted to the top, what gets downvotes, what elicits a negative reaction, and what elicits a positive reaction.2. Befriend mods/admins with an incentive, then ask them to post for you.Go to the mod list which appears in every subreddit (usually appears in the bottom right corner of every subreddit). Direct message some of the guys on there and tell them that you\u2019ve been an active member and ask VERY NICELY if you can promote.Remember, it\u2019s all about positioning. Something like the following should do the trick.Hey ___,I\u2019ve been active on the subreddit for a while now, and it\u2019s been a blast. The community here really supports each other, which is rad.Before I just post something that\u2019s a little bit promotional, I wanted to ask you if it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s a giveaway of my brand <XXX> and it\u2019s super relevant to the <XXX> subreddit. If it\u2019s okay with you, would you mind if I posted it? Wanted to get the okay from you first because I hate blatant spam myself.Anyways, it\u2019s been a blast contributing to this subreddit and I look forward to more awesome discussions.For an old e-commerce company I founded and sold, Winter Lotus, our team became friends with the moderator of /r/streetwear and even became a customer at his store in order to solidify our relationship. Best $50 ever sent. He posted our site on the sidebar and that generated tons of traffic for us.Getting mods to post FOR YOU works really well because the subreddit trusts them and their post is worth 10x of your own post. After the first email, you should ask them post your contest for you, and say that you\u2019re willing to give the mod a prize in return for this. Here\u2019s a sample message you could send:Awesome! You rock. Before I post it though, I was wondering if you were open to posting it for me in exchange for a copy of the prize yourself? The community trusts your word so much more, so I\u2019d be happy to give you a lifetime pro version of VYPER in exchange for that endorsement from you. Our contest can be found here: http://vyper.io/c/63. If you can\u2019t get mods to post for you, then you\u2019ll have to do it yourself.There\u2019s always a chance you\u2019re going to get deleted, so make sure what you\u2019re posting isn\u2019t violating subreddit rules. Some subreddits (like /r/startups) are super strict about self promotion so I try to do as little of it as possible in those groups. Instead I find groups that are more lenient with their policy.Here\u2019s an example of what you could post:This worked because for a couple months, Winter Lotus had been extremely active on the reddit subreddit and the community was very aware of them.Below is an example from BeardBrand, who promoted their contest on Reddit and got really good feedback. They used Imgur to host their contest image and then posted contest details in the description of the image and in the comment.4. Get upvotes from friends, but don\u2019t overdo it.Make sure you have a group of friends that will upvote your post right after you post it. Without an initial bump right after posting, it becomes hard for your post to make the front page. Upvoting rings are discouraged on reddit, so don\u2019t do it on a mass scale, but it\u2019s pretty common practice to get a few of your friends to upvote your post right after you\u2019ve made it.Other TipsEach subreddit responds to different things. I noticed /r/entrepreneur really likes long case studies. I noticed /r/startups doesn\u2019t like blog spam, so if I ever post there I always post the entire contents of my blog with links out to other content. Some subreddits only like images through imgur. The list goes on.If you get no traction on your posts, STUDY the top posts in your subreddit. See exactly what they\u2019re doing and try to replicate it. This is why I know that case studies work for /r/entrepreneurMake sure you\u2019re keeping track of time vs reward. This is why I advise you to focus on the bigger subreddits to really gain traction within their community and befriend the community heads. On the other hand, you can do more of a \u201cspray and pray\u201d approach to smaller subreddits because it then becomes a quantity over quality approach. Expect to get some posts deleted, but continue being as genuine as possible and you\u2019ll get a few posts to stick (especially in less strict subreddits).Originally published at VYPER.", "responses": 1, "tags": []}, {"title": "Case Study: How a Viral Leaderboard Contest Generated 7k B2B Leads & 8k Social Followers", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/case-study-how-a-viral-leaderboard-contest-generated-7k-b2b-leads-8k-social-followers-1b90b7da27cf?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2017-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2018-02-02", "readtime": "10.9", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Case Study: How a Viral Leaderboard Contest Generated 7k B2B Leads & 8k Social FollowersVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowMar 22, 2017 \u00b7 11 min readSummary \u2014 This post is going to give you all the information/tasks you need to run a successful viral leaderboard contest to collect a ton of high-quality email leads and grow your social following faster than any other marketing strategy.We were told time and time again that SaaS and B2B are two things that don\u2019t mix when it comes to running contests and giveaways, heck those two things don\u2019t work using most marketing strategies.Contests and giveaway campaigns have been super successful for our eCommerce clients and users but using them for B2B and SaaS companies was like pulling teeth. The excitement, engagement and viral lift were just not present for these types of businesses.So we looked back on all our B2B marketing efforts and made a list of strategies for growing email lists. We highlighted a few of them and the issues we ran into.These were a few strategies we tried.Content marketing / blogging (too slow)Guest blogging and podcasts (way too time intense)Webinars (too much time investment and setup cost, people wanted fast results)Direct response lead gen ads on Adwords, Facebook, Twitter etc. (too expensive)Cold emailing (super boring and time-consuming)We tried all of the above methods at some point in our B2B digital marketing journey but never really found the sweet spot in quality, cost and quantity.So we thought, F**K it, lets build our own badass contest that works better than any other acquisition strategy, does what we want and makes the customer as happy as the brand/business owner. EASY, YEAH!Here is the link to the viral leaderboard contest we created \u2014 visit contest (btw it is closed so you can\u2019t enter but you can see the landing page and how it worked and generated over 7k emails for us).Download: Our key takeaways and learnings from running this viral leaderboard contest!The birth of the Leaderboard ContestWe took everything we knew about viral + contests + acquisition and growth and put it all into 1 viral leaderboard contest tool! This took a fricken long time but we got there and once we build the beta version it was time to test!Below are all the details from our test contest that generated these listed results within 20 days! Not bad ;)Results from our test leaderboard contest:Emails Collected 7,000+Instagram Followers gained 850+Facebook Group Growth 350+ (we started at ground 0 pretty much)New Twitter Followers 3,000+New Pinterest followers 2,500+New YouTube Subscribers 550 (we were not expecting this!)To be honest we were a little disappointed as we had set a goal of acquiring 10k emails from this contest, this was factoring in 20\u201330% of those emails being spam or unusable.Once the contest ended, we ran the exported list though www.edq.com and discovered that only 12% of the emails were rubbish. SUCCESS! Not as bad as we had thought.We have seen some B2C niches collect a ton more emails but had 20\u201330% of them be spam so we were pretty happy with this.Not only did the leaderboard contest limit spam but it had a super high email engagement rate when we sent out contest updates like \u201chalf way\u201d and \u201cending soon\u201d notifications!Reflecting on the above we learned that our leaderboard was able to collect quality emails due to the engagement, cheater detection and nature of the contest prizes! Consider this when choosing a service to use for your contests (quality over quantity if possible)!A few things we learned from our test contest80/20 rules applies, we collected 80 of our emails in the last week.Engagement and competitiveness is awesome. By adding the entrant\u2019s avatar, number of points and leaderboard rank we were able to get people visiting their thankyou/share/dashboard page multiple times throughout the contest.Offer something epic but not too epic. We had a lot of people question if our contest was real due to the size of the prize. It is super important to make your prizes relevant to the crowd you want to attract.Support, support, support. Make sure you take the time to answer questions from entrants and the better the relationship the more they will share your contest.Our Facebook group was the most active it had ever been during the contest. Use these group settings to create a community and build relationships!By using a number of prize redemption options we were able to involve everyone who entered our contest. We offered prizes for top 5 leaderboard rankings, number of points collected (prize received after collecting 150 entry points) and random winner draw (anyone could win, even last place has a chance!).We wish we had launched the contest with the random winner reward. We only introduced it half way through the contest and I think we lost a lot of early entrants who did not want to compete for top spot!How We Did ItThe easiest way to explain this is to break it down into steps. This was for our SaaS company so is probably a little more complicated/harder that your usual eCommerce or content website.IdeationPrize/Reward (partners)Building the contestPromotionFollow-upYou can jump to any section that you may be at but I suggest you read through all the steps to make the most of your contest marketing campaign. Learn from our mistakes, it will save you a ton of time and money ;)Step ONE \u2014 IdeationThis is pretty much what we discussed above, most companies go through a stage of considering/arguing what the best marketing tactic for them is. This can be in any of the forms listed at the start of this post, I \u2018m sure there are also more options!We obviously went with viral contests as our marketing strategy to grow our email list and social accounts.Next, we had to think:Who do we want to attract?What do those people like?Where do they hangout?We identified our target marketing and then came up with a number of prizes to get people interested in entering our contest. Our magic offer was lifetime subscriptions to other complimentary SaaS products, what business owner doesn\u2019t love FREE lifetime subscriptions?We then broke down the prizes into:Rank 1st, 2nd and top 5 (highest value, hard to achieve)Number of entry points collected (lowest value, easy to achieve)Random Draw (medium value, requires luck to achieve)Once we had the reward tiers planned out we focused on finding products to offer for these tiers.Step TWO \u2014 Prize/Reward (partners)There are a few options when it comes to what to offer. The main prize is usually the product of the company or something complimentary that they purchase as an investment to the contest.E.g. A gym might offer a membership or a year\u2019s worth of protein powder. Or an online shoe retailer might offer 1 pair of shoes or a running magazine subscription.We decided to go the other way and find the top companies our target market wanted to use. For example, we wanted to get the interest of people who used Clickfunnels, MeetEdgar, MixMax, PipeDrive and a few other SaaS subscriptions.People will have a ton of articles and BS published on automating the outreach but if you just spend the time building the relationship and genuinely offering value, you don\u2019t need the automation for what we were doing.Take the time in selection and crafting your emails and your close rate will be 100x higher than any automation you can do.Out of all the people we contacted to partner with for this contest about 80% of them said yes.Here is the email we used to propose the leaderboard contest partnership.Once you have a relationship with the people you want to partner with it becomes a lot easier to promote and get feedback on your contest. Plus the benefit to this was also the follow-up partnerships in the form of joint deals, case studies and cross promotions.Of course we used a few tools in this process to remind us to follow up and keep organized. We aren\u2019t super hero\u2019s!Tools \u2014 MixMax, Google Sheets, Rapportive Chrome extensionStep THREE \u2014 Building giveawayNow that we had a number of partners to help buff up our prize pool, our contest was looking pretty good. We had enough partners on board to fill out all our reward tiers and make them pretty impressive.The next step was the setup of the actual contest. Since we used our own tool VYPER the actual build out of the contest was super quick.A few things to note when creating your contest:Always create separate sharing images for each social channel, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest all need their own sizing.Set an appropriate time frame and make sure you include some solid T&C\u2019s. Between 2\u20136 weeks are good contest lengths. Evergreen contests are also amazing but we will go into that another day!Make the prizes super obvious so people know what they can win and remind people how to win. E.g. On the contest page include a subtitle like \u201cFill in your name, email and start sharing to collect points to win!\u201d.Use images and video when possible. Most people hate reading or do not have time to do it. Use images, dot points, video and anything else you can to make the message faster and easier to understand! (I know, you are probably thinking what a hypocrite. He is making me read a 2,000+ word case study but telling me not use a lot of text!)Add your GA, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and any other code or tracking tags to your contest. You want that data! It is just as important as the email address!Here is a quick video tutorial on how to build a leaderboard contest:As I mentioned before, this part of your contest is actually one of the easiest. Just make sure to cross off the basics.We also designed and built VYPER with conversion optimized in mind so the templates have been built to get you the best conversion rates!Step FOUR \u2014 PromotionThis is a make or break step! Promoting your contest is just as important as creating it. A good prize and traffic source is key for generating tons of emails and new followers.FREE Download: 17 ways to promote your contest to make it go viral!Let\u2019s break it down by days so you can see exactly what we did:Day 1\u20133Promoted the shit out of it to personal networks (friends, colleges & family) first.Publish a blog post announcing the launch of the contest.Post to all of your own social channels every 2\u20133 days. Tag your partners if possible to spread some love.Posted in Facebook groups (ask the admins first, here is a post on that).Post in other communities like Slack, inbound.org, growthhacker.com etc.Post within niche specific forums (Warrior Forum, Sitepoint and Blackhat World are a few for B2B).Submit your contest to appropriate giveaway sites, popular one is the sub-reddit /giveaways.Run ads to get the ball rolling, remember that the leaderboard is viral so it has a snowball effect so you need to start strong. A few common networks are Facebook (easiest), LinkedIn (most expensive), Reddit (hardest), Twitter (most effective for B2B).Day 3\u20135Work with you partners, get them to share the contest on social and to their newsletter/email list if possible. We tried to get all partners to do this so there would be a benefit for everyone, the cross exposure was fantastic and all partners were exposed to new potential customers.Try and get featured on other people\u2019s blogs and industry leading websites (PR).Reach out to content curators that may be interested in sharing the contest with their audience.Day 5\u201310Send out reminder emails for entrants to keep sharing (we did halfway point and a few days before contest ended but you could send more).Repost to some of those communities if possible to give an update on the contest. For example, we introduced some new partner\u2019s half way through. Which allowed us to resubmit and update a lot of our original promotion channels.Stay engaged with support and updates on the contest to people who have entered. (Make sure to add your contact details (support email) somewhere on your thank you page)Follow up with partners to see if they have posted to social or send out an email to their audience.Day 10\u201320You are nearly there, keep going.Support and questions (a lot of this came through our website live chat as mentioned before).Keep posting to your own social channels.Send out an email to everyone who has entered. Announce that they have 1 more week to collect points to win the grand prize.By this stage, the viral leaderboard contest should be doing most of the work for you. You should now have enough entrants referring others to keep those new emails and social follows rolling in!Step FIVE \u2014 Follow UpThis step is one of the most important, you need to do a few things here to finish strong.Thank everyone for entering.Provide one final piece of value (we offered exclusive offers to our partner tools).Thank your partners.Send your winners their prizes and connect them to the contest partners if needed. Try and do this as soon as possible!Use all your leads by entering them into a value add email drip or send them further follow up offers.We found that our list was extremely engaged as we had some huge open and click through rates on our contest updates and follow up series around 40\u201350% as you saw above on the contest update emails.We also tied this into the launch of our viral leaderboard contest tool which everyone had seen a live demo of now. This really helped spread the awareness of our product launch!Final TakeawaysWe learnt a ton about SaaS and B2B acquisition from this test. We did see a lower volume of entrants compared to other B2C contests that we had run in the past but our final B2B list was much more engaged and of higher quality. Hard to say if this was due to the niche or if it was to do with the higher engaged leaderboard contest type \u2014 i\u2019m going with the latter ;).If you are to only remember one thing from this case study it should be:Plan out your marketing campaign and identify what your goal is, if it is email leads and brand exposure consider viral leaderboard contests as they worked a lot better for us in terms of cost and scalability compared to other strategies.Let us know if you have any questions about this campaign, here is a link to the viral leaderboard contest demo and here you can try it out on our free trial.Here is also a link to all our YouTube videos which show you how to setup contests in under 10min!Originally published at VYPER.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "3 Unusual Hacks to Grow Your Email List to 7500 in 30 Days!", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/3-unusual-hacks-to-grow-your-email-list-to-7500-in-30-days-3d38d4574f0a?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2017-08-28", "last_modified_date": "2017-09-15", "readtime": "6.28", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "3 Unusual Hacks to Grow Your Email List to 7500 in 30 Days!VYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowAug 28, 2017 \u00b7 7 min readSummary \u2014 Are you the average marketer or the guy working smarter not harder? Well Carlos from Pourfection Coffee decided to be the latter and share his story of collecting 7,500 emails using a VYPER leaderboard contest. He sent this post to us to publish as he was so excited with the results he just wanted to share it with others.A lion and a cheater make a betOne day a lion and a cheater were hanging out. They were both so fed up with hunting zebras, and both knew there had to be an easier way to eat.So they decided to make a bet to see which one could capture the most zebras.Both got to work immediately.The lion frantically searched for the finest grass the savannah had to offer. He then put signs up at all the watering holes promoting discounts on fresh green grass at the lion\u2019s den for the first 50 zebras. The result?750 ZEBRAS FOR HIM AND HIS PRIDE TO EAT!A feat that was unheard of.Meanwhile the Cheater decided to take a smarter approach. He decided that he should giveaway all the finest grass in his inventory for FREE.All you had to do to win was to be present at his cave at the time he announced the winner.But the catch was, if a zebra bought a friend, they would get an extra entry point to the grass contest, which increased the chances of them winning all the grass!The result of the cheetah\u2019s campaign?\u2026 7,500 ZEBRAS!!!10X the lion\u2019s campaign! He had so much zebra that he and his pack never went hungry again and had enough to give back to the hyenas.The lion was furious and accused him of being a cheetah! Ba Dum Tisss! (Sorry I had to)So what does this dumb story actually mean to you and your business?It means that if you\u2019re just beginning or looking to inject growth into your email list you can go about it one of two ways.Use a traditional method: Create a lead magnet, run ads to your site, get people to download said lead magnet, hope they find value and share it.Give them an offer they would be stupid to refuse and incentivize them to share it like mad men using VYPER\u2019s Leaderboard contest for example.We at XFection decided the latter and went from literally less than 100 subscribers to 0ver 7,500 engaged subscribers in 30 days! All while increasing our social media accounts by 1500%.If option 2 sounds a bit more appealing to you, good, keep reading. We are going to give you all of our secrets.WARNING: Following the contents of this article will make your competitors accuse you of being a cheetah. (Ok seriously last time)1. Twitter Growth Hack!Here\u2019s what you do:Use the social media automated features to work for you by adding hashtags in the Twitter Snippet.When people Tweet from the backend of the contest to gain points these hashtags will allow your message to trend.So whenever users on Twitter search #starbucks, or #coffee the likelihood our Twitter page and contest would be discovered increases.The post looked as follows. (I love how this girl added \u201camazing\u201d to the snippet! Made my day!)We produce and sell a nootropic (brain supplements) coffee creamer, which gives the drinker a boost of energy beyond that of normal coffee.TIP \u2014 Find out what complimentary brands are out there that have your ideal customer already and offer their products as a way to incentivize your contestants to share the word about you.2. How to leveraged thumbnail images to work for you!We already knew that people were going to be sharing our post left and right, so we were proactive to use this to our advantage to maximize the amount of attention it would gain.We did this by using an attention grabbing image. (See above Twitter post)Everything from the red coffee cup and text, to the girl sitting on top of the cup, the image stands out!And the results show for it.Just on Twitter, we gained 1,353 follows about a 1500% improvement.Talk about powerful\u2026Although this traffic is good and you can control it; it isn\u2019t YOUR traffic.This is why transferring this traffic into real emails so you own the traffic FOREVER is so important.And this brings me to my next point.TIP \u2014 Twitter and Pinterest do not limit your images to 20% text unlike Facebook so take advantage of that.3. Influencing Instagram Influencers\u2026 Influentially\u2026This is the magic bullet that took our list from 1,000 emails to 5,000 pretty much overnight.This hack probably takes the most amount of work, but trust me, it\u2019s completely WORTH IT!Here\u2019s the #1 key to influencers \ud83d\udc49 PROVIDE VALUE!It sounds simple because it is!Yet, too many people reach out to influencers expecting the world for doing nothing in return.Sometimes you can simply offer a sample of your product or some swag. In most cases people are going to want you to Venmo them or send gift cards.$10 Starbucks gift card for exposure to 15k coffee lovers? Yes please!Our steps were as follows:1. Find AccountsCoffee related pages with appropriate number of followers (ours were 5K \u2014 100k) were our bread and butter. Anything less wasn\u2019t worth our time and anything over 100K was out of budget. Side note here \u2014 engagement is critical!You don\u2019t want to waste your time and money on accounts that don\u2019t get the eyeballs. You want at least 10% of engagement to follower count.2. Direct MessageOnce you find a page with good followers and engagement you need to DM them and say something along the lines of:\u201cHey _____, \u2764\ufe0f your posts! We are a nootropic coffee creamer company and are giving away a year\u2019s supply of coffee to a couple of lucky people\u2026. What would you like us to get you to help spread the word?\u2026 Lmk\u2026\u201dAnd always, always make sure you negotiate for a deal where both sides benefit.Know the going rates for influencer marketing. This is a helpful chart to show you what you can expect to pay. https://influence.co/go/rates3. RepeatDo this 1,000 times and you\u2019ll have a few people that are willing to help share the contest. Posting on their story is good if they are verified since when their viewers swipe up they are immediately connected to your contest.But the best is when the influencer is able to post your link in their bio for a period of time.4. Wait\u2026.Increasing your reach like this (along with the Twitter hacks) the right person will come along and BLOW UP your list.The top 3 people in our contest were responsible for 60% of our list. When these people come along, they will quite literally take your list from 0 to 5,000 pretty much overnight.Just make sure that you\u2019re 100% ready for that kind of explosion.Are you a lion or a cheetah?That about sums up how we crushed our first campaign on VYPER! Their Leaderboard contest is so incredibly powerful!Seriously you\u2019ll want to jump on it before the masses do.It\u2019s so easy to use and setup that a couple of newbies like us were able to do it successfully! Not to mention they are always available on their live chat on their site. Any question we had was answered in a timely manner. We will be back for round two very soon!Go get more zebras!!Best of luck!Written by: Carlos Courtney | Co-Creator of PourfectionPourfection increases focus and cognition so that you can get more work done in less time.By adding nootropics, we were to reduce the crash and jitters of coffee so you won\u2019t have to crash at 2pm and drink 4 cups a day just to get by.It feels like the amount of coffee never ends, and still your eye lids feel heavy as you continue to do the same thing over and over and over.

I worked so hard to get them there and I just don\u2019t want to annoy them or lose them\u201d.That\u2019s one of the most popular questions I\u2019ve gotten about email marketing ever since I started CopyMonk.It\u2019s a valid concern, of course.You don\u2019t want to ruin your relationship with your subscribers and burn out your list, especially since it\u2019s the lifeblood of your business.So the usual advice to avoid this is to limit the number of emails that you send and only send an email when you have some sort of sale going.However, there\u2019s a better way.It\u2019s totally possible to send out send out an email to your list every single day with a link to your product without being pushy or salesy.In fact, your subscribers will love you even more for doing so.You just need to know how to do it the right way by writing \u201cCopyMonk-Style\u201d emails. And one of the core principles of writing CopyMonk-style emails is the 90/10 rule.What Is The 90/10 Rule?The most important part of email marketing is to find a way to be a \u201cwelcomed guest\u201d in your subscribers inbox.With everyone\u2019s inbox so flooded these days, mostly with promotional offers, it\u2019s hard to stand out. Heck, many people even have 2 email addresses. One for \u201cspam\u201d and one for personal use.If you just write emails like everyone else, you\u2019ll be hated\u2026 or even worse, ignored.So what you want to do is create the expectation that all of your emails are worthwhile to open. And you do that by following the 90/10 rule.Without rambling on about it, the 90/10 rule is about the basic format of your emails as well as you email strategy.You want the majority of your emails to be 90% content and 10% promotional. You also want 90% of all the emails you send to follow this 90/10 rule, with the other 10% being purely promotional.Of course, it doesn\u2019t need to literally be 90/10. It can be 80/20 or even 95/5. The point is, you\u2019re delivering content while just mentioning your product when it\u2019s relevant in every email.The Catch? \u201cHow-To\u201d Content Will Kill Your Results!I had to write this section because it\u2019s the biggest mistake people make once they finally \u201cget\u201d the whole 90/10 rule thing.You see, while the 90 in the 90/10 rule does mean 90% content\u2026 it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s all 100% educational, how-to content.If you\u2019re only sending an email a week or less, then that\u2019s fine. In that situation, you\u2019ll probably be best suited to hit them hard with actionable value.But if you\u2019re going to write emails at a higher frequency, like you should be if you want to maximize your results, you\u2019re not going to get away with traditional \u201chow-to\u201d content.Why?Because traditional \u201chow-to\u201d content is actually boring. Sure, your list will love it for the first 2 weeks, but then they\u2019ll start ignoring it.It\u2019s like that boring teacher back in highschool.He\u2019s super smart and will teach you a ton of stuff, but within 15 minutes of class starting, you\u2019re already in the perfect position to take a power nap.However, an exciting teacher will be the complete opposite. Yea, you\u2019ll learn all of the same stuff in the same time span. But this time, you\u2019re awake, attentive, and probably even enjoying yourself a bit.You see, content itself is not valuable.Only the experience of consuming and using that content is valuable.So instead of writing just boring \u201chow-to\u201d content all the time, what you want to do is to start writing \u201cinfotainment-style\u201d content.That\u2019s when you combine both educational content with entertainment so that it\u2019s easier and more enjoyable to consume.Kind of like when people put cheese on their broccoli. It just makes the experience a lot better than if it was just the broccoli.The Easy Way To Write Highly Valuable, \u201cInfotainment-Style\u201d Email ContentThousands of years ago, before writing was invented, we used to share information in a particular way.This particular form of communication was used to pass down all sorts of important information including things like morals, religion, culture, and more.It was ideal since it was so easy to remember things this way and was naturally captivating to anyone who listened to it. In fact, you can say we\u2019ve been hard-wired to both consume and share information this way.Best of all, it works with everyone.So what is this mysterious way to share information?Stories.See what I did there?The best way to write \u201cinfotainment-style\u201d content for your list is by educating people by telling them a story that contains the valuable content within it. Not only that, but stories also make the content seem more valuable than it would normally seem like, but that\u2019s a story for another day.For today, I want to direct you to particular type of story\u2026 personal stories.While there are a ton of ways to write stories, the easiest and fastest way to get started is by writing about personal stories that relate to the content you\u2019re really trying to get across.For example, lets say I\u2019m selling sports supplements.I could just write emails about the 5 reasons why whey protein is so important for muscle recovery and muscle building. However, that\u2019s a bit boring.Instead, it would be a lot better to talk about the last time I was struggling to build muscle and a bodybuilder at the gym told me that the reason I wasn\u2019t getting results was because I wasn\u2019t consuming enough protein.Then from there, I could go on about how I asked this guy why it mattered and how I confirmed advice after scowering the web to see if he was right.THEN I would talk about the 5 reasons the guy talked about.As you can see, writing emails this way is a lot more interesting as you\u2019re not relying on boring content. If fact, everything that you teach with a personal story will automatically become interesting.How To Effectively Sell Your Product In The Last 10% Of Your EmailSo here we are, the most important part of your email.Fortunately, if you did everything else right, this is also the easiest part of your email.That\u2019s because you\u2019re not hard-selling anything. Instead, you\u2019re going to use the same tactic David Ogilvy, probably the most popular advertiser ever, used to sell billions of dollars worth of products.You see, David Ogilvy is considered the father of \u201csoft-selling\u201d.What\u2019s that? Well, that\u2019s basically when you sell something without pushing it. Almost always, it\u2019s just a mention of your relevant product or service.The most famous example of this was with the house ads David Ogilvy wrote to promote his ad agency, Ogilvy & Mather. They were wildly successful leading, so they led to lots of copycat ads.If you notice the very bottom right of his ad, he talks about Ogilvy & Mather, but doesn\u2019t pressure you into becoming a client.In fact, in his case, he doesn\u2019t sell you on it at all. He says the only ones who gain access to all his other great content are his clients.So if you liked his ad, then you would naturally want to become a client to find out more.Now, in the case of your email, we\u2019re not going to be so \u201csoft\u201d about it either. You\u2019re still selling your product. The difference is that you want to tell people why they should buy your product in just a couple of sentences.Anymore then that is too hard and anything less then that is not hard enough. You want to be in that \u201cgoldilocks\u201d area during this part of your email.Do this every email and your list will never mind it. In fact, they\u2019ll probably love you for it since you\u2019re making it easy for them to buy something if they\u2019re interested.An Example Of The 90/10 Rule In Action From CopyMonk DailySince this whole 90/10 rule is probably new to you, it would be best to actually see a real example of this.So I\u2019m going to show you 1 example from CopyMonk daily, which is my daily email marketing newsletter for business owners.Notice how I use story to ultimately teach something and then pivot into a sale without ever being pushy or salesy.Check this out:In this email, I\u2019m talking about what happened in a particular episode of Nathan For You. You can read the email for all the details, but realize how you don\u2019t see me teach anything until I\u2019ve given it context by talking about the show.Then, I end the email with a call to action to my product.In this case, I\u2019m connecting my educational content with something I teach inside my course, This builds curiosity and leads to an easy and non-spammy transition from content to promotion.Like I said, this is my daily newsletter. So I write emails like this to my list every single day. Yet, even though I sell in every email, people love getting my emails.ConclusionMost business owners suck at email marketing.Fortunately, if you follow the advice in this article, you\u2019ll be a lot better off. Not only will you sell more products, but you\u2019ll also build a deep relationship with your list at the same time.Now that\u2019s what you call a win-win.With that said, If you want a 100% free, 1-page checklist that summarizes my entire CopyMonk methodology to writing emails, then click here.Danavir is the founder of CopyMonk, where he helps business owners double their sales with email marketing.Originally published at VYPER.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Copywriting", "Email Marketing", "Copymonk", "Danavir Sarri"]}, {"title": "How to Generate More Revenue (Not Just Leads) With Viral Contests", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/how-to-generate-more-revenue-not-just-leads-with-viral-contests-f941034366c0?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2017-05-05", "last_modified_date": "2018-01-25", "readtime": "6.66", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "How to Generate More Revenue (Not Just Leads) With Viral ContestsVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowMay 5, 2017 \u00b7 7 min readThere\u2019s a misconception people have about viral contests \u2014 they believe that these contests can only be used for lead generation.Well, I\u2019m here to shatter that notion and tell you that our clients have been making tons of revenue during their viral contest by implementing a few key strategies.And while you can create several different types of viral contests (like viral sweepstakes or viral leaderboards), we\u2019ll focus on the viral leaderboard because it\u2019s new and it\u2019s been getting incredible results for our clients.So what is the viral leaderboard?It\u2019s a type of contest where your users will climb a \u201cleaderboard\u201d in order to win prizes. They climb the leaderboard by getting points, namely through referring others to the contest or by following you on social media. So for example, your contestant might get 25 points for following you on Instagram.If that\u2019s a bit confusing, try signing up for our demo leaderboard here.What are the benefits of a viral leaderboard?Generate cheap leads \u2014 The cost to get someone\u2019s attention and acquire an email address is constantly increasing. Depending on the industry, you can be paying between $3\u20135 an email. Using contests rewards users for giving you that information as well as incentivizes them to refer others. We\u2019ve seen leads come very cheaply with viral contests.Build a larger social following \u2014 You don\u2019t wanna be paying for fake followers. The viral leaderboard makes it easy to generate a larger social following by incentivizing the follow in exchange for extra \u201cpoints\u201d in the contest. In fact, we used a viral leaderboard contest to add 550 new YouTube subscribers, one of the hardest networks to build followers on.Increase sales volume \u2014 Contests are not just for acquiring email addresses. You can also use them to drive more sales on time of entry using unique coupon offers as well as nurture those leads into customers. On average it takes 2\u20134 brand interactions before a purchase is considered.Increase brand awareness \u2014 Nothing works better than word of mouth. Using contests is a great way to get a large amount of exposure for your brand. As entrants share your contest with friends and family they \u201cendorsing\u201d you brand and essentially recommend you to their friends and family to check out.Build audiences for advertising (Facebook custom audiences & lookalikes) \u2014 Facebook is now one of the best marketing channels the web has to offer. If can be expensive and hard to get started though. Facebook will then go and find the people who are most alike to that list for you to then serve ads to.One of the first things you MUST think about when you create your leaderboard, is what prize structure you want to offer. An optimized prize structure can make or break your contest.How to use a tiered rewards system to maximize your resultsIt is a good idea to offer multiple ways for entrants to be rewarded. This keeps people engaged and helps keep them motivated to continue sharing your contest. There are 3 main reward types that are most common.Placement rewards \u2014 This is when a contest rewards the entrants that performed the best. For example \u201c1st place wins a $500 Swiss watch or Top 5 entrants win a $100 watch stand.\u201d This is the CRUX of your leaderboard. Get people competing to get the top rewards.Points rewards \u2014 This is when a contest rewards entrants for reaching a certain number of points. For example \u201cunlock a 20% OFF entire store voucher when you reach 200 points.\u201d This one is important because even if the new user is super far away from the top of the leaderboard, they\u2019re still incentivized to get points.Random draw rewards \u2014 This is a more generic reward type and this is just a winner chosen at random. Adding a random draw just gives even more incentive to your entrant to share the contest and get more points.So now you can see there are a few different ways to get people involved in your contest. The most important part is to make your contestants feel good, give them points, reward them and congratulate them.Setting Up Multiple RewardsFrontend Rewards DisplayLittle do they know you are warming them up for your ultimate monetization strategy.BONUS Checklist \u2014 6 Common Success Factors From Over 10 Viral Contests! DOWNLOADHow do you monetize your contest, effectively?Offer unique coupon codes \u2014 Make your contest entrants feel special, give them a special coupon code/voucher only they have access to. Use the wording \u201cget a promo card\u201d or something similar. Then send an email with an image of a fancy card with the coupon code on it instead. This increases the perceived value of the coupon. (Make them feel like they won something special).** We recommend giving them a smaller reward as a \u201cpoint reward\u201d \u2014 like $10 \u2014 when they reach 100 points. We found $10 \u201cpromo cards\u201d work really really well VS a $10 off discount. Just think about it \u2014 when was the last time you threw away a gift card and when was the last time you threw away a \u201c$10 off coupon?\u201d You NEVER throw away gift cards! However, you forget about or throw away discount codes all the time.Remind your contestants to share to get more points \u2014 Send them a sequence of follow-up emails to get them to keep sharing the contest in order to get more points. Hit them also through social media. The more people you collect the bigger the follow-up email paycheck will be.Make a super high discount for people that reach a really high number of points \u2014 For example say a user gets 100 points per referral. Give them an 80% discount if they get to 10,000 entries. Getting emails of 100 people will probably worth that amount of money. Remember at the end you will be doing a follow-up email trying to convert all these people.Contest follow up email \u2014 At the end of the contest you can send out an email thanking everyone for entering, and that the winners have been drawn. Also put together a special deal for entrants only like a custom coupon code or a \u201cbuy 1 get 1 free\u201d deal. We wrote a blog post just on this topic here.Educational email sequence \u2014 You may be selling a higher ticket item, so ease your way into the sale by sending 2\u20133 value-add educational emails first. You could start off with a few emails on why they need your product. Highlight that they entered the original contest for a reason, they already wanted your product. It might just take a few more convincing emails to convert them.Company update emails \u2014 Now that you have the contest entrants\u2019 emails, send them an update when you have news about your latest products.Gift/purchase idea emails \u2014 If you contest was not a good fit for a direct sales, suggest that they purchase for their parents / friends!Holiday deals emails \u2014 If your product is seasonal, now you have a huge list to alert every time New Years, Christmas, Mother\u2019s Day, etc comes around! Start off your high season strong with a warmed up audience that already knows about you and your product.Birthday offer emails \u2014 Since you can collect more data for a contestant to enter why not ask their DOB, so when their birthday comes up you send them a special offer. They can either claim it as a gift to themselves or share it with someone who will buy it for them ;)For a more in-depth article on maximizing your email revenue, click here.tl:dr \u2014 Tips on how to monetize your viral contests:Use unique coupons for that contest onlyFollow-up emails asking your contestants to share, being specific HELPSChoose relevant prizes to your target audience (You want to attract the right crowd)Add consolation prizes (so everyone wins)Increase the perceived value as much as possible (what does not cost you a lot of money but is very valuable to others).

They were able to use a book giveaway they set up in under 20min to get a ton of likes, shares and emails.They were kind enough to write a post on their experience, see below:Pain point we had with lead acquisitionWe did not have an established, effective strategy to obtain email addresses for people to receive our content in their inboxes.We have links to subscribe to our email list on our website and social media outlets, but those links can often get overlooked and people are just used to those strategies so they are now less effective.We also do not want to have any pop-ups on our website asking for email sign-ups when people log on to our site as this looks like spam and decreases the quality of our website.About the brand and nicheLibertarianism.org is the Cato Institute\u2019s treasury of resources for exploring the theory, history, and practice of liberty \u2014 or free, open, and civil societies.

People love a free book (and knowledge!) so a book giveaway contest was a great way to engage people.This also ensures them a steady flow of intellectual content to their email inboxes, and getting that intellectual content is basically why they signed up to enter the contest in the first place.We found Vyper via Product Hunt and the giveaway setup was super easy!The promotion strategy we used for your giveawayThe only promotion we did was announcing the book giveaway through all of our social media channels as well as our already-existing email list.Having sent out an announcement out through our current email list sounds counterintuitive but we thought maybe the existing subscribers might forward to friends, or even want to enter themselves and then post the contest on their own social media channels to obtain more entries and get discovered by friends.Having sent out an announcement out through our current email list sounds counterintuitive but we thought maybe the existing subscribers might forward to friends, or even want to enter themselves and then post the contest on their own social media channels to obtain more entries and get discovered by friends.We really didn\u2019t have to do much promotion or our giveaway at all!The before and after results (use as many images as possible, people love them and can share them) traffic leads sales inquiries etcWe ran the giveaway for a limited time using the VYPER countdown timer and saw a 125% increase in our email entire email list size from a single giveaway.Originally published at VYPER.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "How Foundr Magazine 2x\u2019d Their Email Acquisition Goal Using VYPER", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/how-foundr-magazine-2xd-their-email-acquisition-goal-using-vyper-e5eac4885fb?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2018-03-19", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-30", "readtime": "3.59", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "How Foundr Magazine 2x\u2019d Their Email Acquisition Goal Using VYPERVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowMar 19, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readBuilding an email list is always a top priority when it comes to building an audience/business online.

We kept it short, sweet and direct, should only take you 2 min to read ;)FREE Webinar: Watch the webinar that is making Shopify stores go VIRAL! [Here]1.Why did you decide to run a contest?We were launching a new training product and wanted to run a competition to build some excitement, anticipation, and ideally a great list of people who would be interested in the new course.Build some hype outside of our e-mail list. People can get overwhelmed with email marketing. I loved the idea that a competition allowed people to buy-in to the idea. They want to get involved and so I was hoping to get people highly engaged through a competition.Wanted to get at least another 5,000 emails onto our list that were interested in the new training.2. What expectations, KPI\u2019s and goals did you have/set for your contest?It was hard to guess. In my head, I wanted to get at least 5,000 emails, ideally 10,000.We didn\u2019t even realize that VYPER was going to increase other areas of our business like social followers/engagement and website traffic/engagment.3. What was your proudest achievement from the campaign?For us, it would have been the engagement on a blog post. It received over 500 comments and remains one of the most popular we have ever published.This help build exposure on the post, traffic to the website and social validation through mass engagement stats! Looks great when people now naturally find the blog post.4. What alternative marketing campaigns have you tried that didn\u2019t work?Tried other competition software that didn\u2019t have the same \u201ccustom\u201d elements as VYPER.In fact, overall they weren\u2019t as customizable and we just couldn\u2019t create such a strong result.5. Contest results:Emails \u2014 13,602+Social followers \u2014 Slightly hard to track because our following was relatively high across most channels (VYPER added social following tracking after our contest).Traffic increase \u2014 Not sure (should have placed the Google Analytics code in the custom code area within the dashboard, would do that next time).Customers/sales/rev \u2014 Was hard to track. We had retargeting plus some people were already on our list.Any other areas you saw growth in \u2014 507 comments on a paid Facebook ad an increase of about 1,000 subscribers on Youtube 19k Facebook views and 232 shares of our promotional video.6. What are the top 5 things you learned from running a contest?They are super powerful. We need to do them more often.It\u2019s great to have different levels that people can unlock and trigger some rewards to keep them motivated.It\u2019s most useful, practical and powerful when designed around your goals. For example, as you taught me, having people engage on specific content. Like a Facebook dark post, or a blog post, or building up social media channels.They take effort, and you need to be excited yourself for your audience to care and get excited.Make the prize as insanely awesome as you can.7. What feature of VYPER did you like the most?THE CUSTOM reward/feature/action thing.Easy to use WYSIWYG editor.Ease of setting up a contestThe reward tiers (random winner, entry milestones, ranked winner)Custom code box to add tracking, custom CSS and any other tags8. What would you do next time you ran a contest?Probably same again, and make some better social media assets to promote the competition.The image used to share your contest is very important. Thousands of people are going to be sharing it across their social channels so it needs to look good!9. How did you promote your contest and what worked the best for you?Through our email list primarily as the seed audience and then announced on our social channels. Once we had the seed audience the contest leveraged the VYPER viral sharing system to do the rest.Have a business of your own?Foundr Magazine is a great source of information for entrepreneurs and you can find out more at Foundr.com or if you have any questions, get in touch with David, he\u2019s the man!

Writer Ian Chandler emailed me after I wrote the original Reddit strategies article, and he said he could had some counters to my ideas. I invited him to get on our blog post to share his strategies.So let\u2019s hear it for Ian Chandler!Using Reddit as a marketing tactic is tricky. Few sites are as unrelenting as Reddit is. Make one wrong move, and you\u2019ll be ridiculed, or even worse, banned.But Reddit can be a potent source for brand attention. If you can get on the good side of the hivemind (more on that in a moment), it\u2019s like winning the lottery. You\u2019ll get a bunch of free publicity and tons of customers out of it.The other day, I read VYPER\u2019s post on Reddit promotion. As a narrative marketer who uses Reddit for networking, traffic, and other professional means, I thoroughly enjoyed it and reached out to Kevin with my own perspective. He asked me to share it with you, and I couldn\u2019t deny.I\u2019ve been using Reddit consistently to get brand fans, and I have to reiterate what Kevin said in his post \u2014 Reddit is a long term channel. Slow and steady wins the race here. But once you\u2019ve provided value and built trust, Reddit marketing becomes extremely effective.Promoting on Reddit the right way is tricky, so it\u2019s important to not screw up. Here are my 5 best tips for marketing on Reddit.Download: The Quick Guide to Reddit Promotion: Get all the content from this blog post as well as extra bonuses in this awesome PDF guide. FREE!1) Create immense value.Redditors don\u2019t want to see rehashed info. They want long, in-depth guides that offer an authoritative take on a subject. Tell your readers why you\u2019re qualified to post on the subject, and then hit them with a few thousand words of detail. Of course, this depends on the niche you\u2019re in, but in many niches, a 3k-4k word guide performs amazingly.It\u2019s even better if you create a post just for Reddit instead of reposting an article from your blog. Redditors love this because that means the content was created with them in mind. In other words, they\u2019re not being subjected to blog spam. If you repost an article, make sure to post the full text and only include a link at the bottom of the article. You\u2019ll appeal to Reddit\u2019s better nature, and your chances of getting traffic are much higher.And don\u2019t create any fluff, either. The average Redditor has an unparalleled bullshit detector. They\u2019ll know if you\u2019re spinning or summarizing. Instead, just provide straight-up value. Write it not to get upvoted, but to help people. That\u2019s how you\u2019ll succeed.In fact, I wholeheartedly believe that value should be at the core of your entire marketing strategy. If you\u2019re not giving away too much value, you\u2019re not standing out from your competition. Be the brand in your niche that is synonymous with value, no matter what you\u2019re doing.(Editor\u2019s note \u2014 If you want to repost your entire blog post onto Reddit, use Reddit converter to make it easy!)2) Spend more time answering questions and giving advice than posting.Posting without commenting on other threads is one of the best ways to piss off Redditors. If you\u2019re doing nothing but plugging your site, people will get tired of you almost immediately.Instead, spend most of your time commenting on others\u2019 threads. By doing so, you\u2019re building yourself up as an authority within the subreddit. You\u2019re giving others your advice from experience, which is of high value on Reddit. If you only post sparingly, you\u2019ll find your post will get a better reception. That\u2019s because people will recognize you from the community, and they\u2019ll associate you with high-quality advice.Don\u2019t skimp on your comments \u2014 be as thorough as possible. Don\u2019t be afraid to leave a long comment, and make sure to continue the dialogue with anyone who replies.3) Leverage the hivemind.Reddit stands out from most other social platforms because of one unique tendency: the hivemind. This is essentially groupthink, wherein the masses tend to echo an early response.For example, if a new thread has no upvotes, a Redditor will probably want to downvote it without even reading it. Likewise, if a new thread has three upvotes, then that same Redditor will probably want to check it out. To get a better understanding of how hivemind works, check out this fantastic article from Popular Mechanics.You might be tempted to skew the initial vote count in your favor, but don\u2019t. It\u2019s important to use Reddit honestly and avoid underhanded tactics like buying upvotes. If you do, chances are you\u2019ll get called out on it sooner than later. Like I\u2019ve mentioned, the average Redditor has an always-on, hyper-aware bullshit detector.Instead, find ways to leverage this hivemind. See what kinds of topics get largely upvoted, and then contribute definitive guides to those topics. You can also use the hivemind to connect with Redditors. If Redditors on a certain subreddit respond to a certain idea or writing tone, then use that in your next post. As Kevin mentioned in his post, take a while to observe your subreddit of choice, and find out what makes it tick.4) For the daring \u2014 don\u2019t link to/mentioning your site.This sounds crazy at first, but it\u2019s entirely possible to get lots of traffic without even mentioning your site. There are a few reasons why:1) When you don\u2019t link to or mention your site, Redditors won\u2019t feel like they\u2019re being marketed to, and that\u2019s crucial. In fact, by not mentioning your site, Redditors will want to know it.2) If the content is good enough, people will message you and ask you.3) Sometimes, people might even hunt down your site and link it themselves. I\u2019ve seen this happen many times.This is an especially powerful technique because it\u2019s so direct and organic. It\u2019s risky and has its downsides, but it should earn a place in anyone\u2019s Reddit strategy.5) Don\u2019t ask friends for help.There was only one tip from the last VYPER post on Reddit that I didn\u2019t fully gel with. It was tip number 4: getting upvotes from friends.As Kevin pointed out, upvoting rings are frowned upon, but the problem here is that the line between an upvoting ring and a few friends helping you out is really hazy. I\u2019d err on the side of caution here, but that\u2019s just me.Play By Reddit\u2019s RulesIf you take one piece of advice from this entire article, let it be this: Play by Reddit\u2019s rules. When you\u2019re posting, you\u2019re jumping into a raucous playground where the cool kids rule. To have even a small chance at being cool yourself, you have to play by their rules. It\u2019s part hazing, part scientific observation.Make sure you check out the reddiquette and follow each subreddit\u2019s rule. Do those two simple things when using Reddit, and your experience will improve by several orders of magnitude.Don\u2019t try to use Reddit to achieve marketing goals. Instead, give people tons of value, and encourage an open conversation about your brand. When done right, Reddit marketing is one of the most organic, effective ways to spread the word about your business.Download: The Quick Guide to Reddit Promotion: Get all the content from this blog post as well as extra bonuses in this awesome PDF guide.

Because, let\u2019s be honest it is a pain in the ass migrating once you are locked in with all of your lists, email drips and logic set up.Below are a few points to consider when choosing who to sign up with. Choosing the best email provider is hard as everyone needs something different. There is no right or wrong answer but hopefully this post will make the right choice for you, more obvious!What to look for when finding the best email providerLong term price \u2014 Some plans might start out cheap but what happens when you start killing your lead-gen strategies and you list forms to a few hundred, thousand or hundreds of thousands. That free sign up account might have been good when you had 100 subscribers but once you hit 10K the price skyrockets.Deliverability \u2014 What is the standard or reputation of the provider you are considering. Ask around how people\u2019s deliverability is with that company. We know Mailchimp has very strict policies on what type of content can be sent through their servers while Aweber has been known to let more \u2018spammy\u2019 emails pass through.Your technical skill level \u2014 If you can\u2019t code in HTML and CSS and don\u2019t plan to hire a developer right out of the gates, make sure you go with a provider who provides templates, drag and drop design or some other non technical solutions to build your emails. Remember that branding and personalization of emails is super important.What is your purpose? \u2014 The reason to send an email to a list is endless but make sure your email service provider specializes in what you need. For example are you an online store trying sell physical products? Are you a SaaS company? Are you a blogger pushing affiliate offers? All of these types of online businesses have email providers that specialize in that need!Segmentation? \u2014 When you start out you will probably think \u201cfu*k it I am putting all my leads into 1 list\u201d. Then 6month later you will be like \u201cfu*k, I wish I hadn\u2019t put all my leads in 1 list\u201d. So make sure you choose a provider that can segment lists the way you need them.A list can be segmented in many ways:Number of opensNumber of clicksNumber of purchases or average order valuegender or agelocationhere are 27 other ways as wellNow that you have the knowledge to make a good decision. Here are a few we like.Klaviyo \u2014 This is THE provider to go with if you\u2019re in e-commerce. They connect directly to your Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce store (and many others) and automatically segment out everything for you. So if you wanted to do cross-sells (send an automated recommendation email to people who purchase X item), it\u2019s built into the platform. Abandon cart functionality is also built right in.The interface is very user friendly and they have a 14 day trial so always worth setting up an account and sending out some test emails to yourself to see if you like it. Also the entry level version is free. Keep all of the points above in mind while test services.Tip: If you\u2019re in e-commerce, just go with Klaviyo and make tons of $.Drip \u2014 Is a lightweight but super powerful email provider, their strongest advantage is their drip logic functionality & marketing automation features. They allow you to create pretty complete email chains based on behaviors of your customs (opened this, clicked on that etc). Their workflows function allows you to create complex decision trees depending on the actions of your user. We use Drip to power our SaaS app, VYPER. It\u2019s really great for SaaS because you can track certain actions in your app and add tags to your specific customer. As a developer, Drip is great because you can take advantage of some really killer functionality.One of their weaknesses is that they don\u2019t have a drag & drop email template builder, so you\u2019re pretty much stuck with very plain templates. That\u2019s actually shown to be great for deliverability, but it\u2019s not the best if you\u2019re an e-commerce company.Since their acquisition, Drip has rolled out a starter package for 100 emails at only $1 per month. That\u2019s not as cheap as Mailchimp\u2019s 2,000 free starter package, but you\u2019re getting much stronger functionality with Drip.Tip: If your email list requires complex decision trees (like a SaaS app might), then Drip was built for you.ConvertKit \u2014 Is email marketing automation for bloggers. They\u2019ve decided to focus primarily on writers & bloggers, and their feature set makes it easy for bloggers & content writers to attract new leads. For example, one nifty feature is that if your reader has already been subscribed to your list, the ConvertKit form shows your Facebook like button or some other code instead.But the real reason you want to go with ConvertKit is because it\u2019s VERY simple to understand and gets you email automation without a huge learning curve. Click triggers allow you to tag certain customers so you can send email directly to those customers, or it can move certain customers to different sequences.You don\u2019t have some of the complex functionality as Drip, but this makes it really easy for the blogger to start using it. And for 99% of bloggers, ConvertKit is enough to get started because you\u2019re not dealing with the decision trees you might be with a SaaS (for example, readers of a blog don\u2019t usually have to login and get onboarded to an app \u2014 these kinds of complex actions are best handled within Drip).And for bloggers, your emails are going to be primarily content, not images, so ConvertKit is fine for you. ConvertKit doesn\u2019t have a fancy template builder, so be prepared to send plain text looking emails.Tip: If you\u2019re a blogger, ConvertKit gets you a leg up from Campaign Monitor and Mailchimp with some powerful segmentation and tagging features.Campaign Monitor \u2014 Is a service that that a lot of agencies or resellers use as they have integrated a white label account pretty successfully. On top of this they also have a pretty good selection of templated emails and a/b split testing of emails. To me they compete head to head with Mailchimp because they\u2019re cheaper and have basic functionality, but aren\u2019t as advanced as the options above.They\u2019re starting to add some e-commerce functionality, but it\u2019s still in beta, and nowhere near as sophisticated as Klaviyo\u2019s.These guys are a good option if you plan to have clients that will also need to send out their own branded emails.Tip: They\u2019re a slightly better version of Mailchimp that doesn\u2019t have a free tier.Mailchimp \u2014 One of the most popular email provider services due to it\u2019s free account up to 2,000 subscribers. Even though these guys start out cheap the cost starts to mount once you grow. They definitely work the price back in further down the line.Having said that these guys have been around FOREVER so they know what they are doing with a/b testing, good email tracking, ok list segmentation and great design templates. One thing to watch out for is, if you are an affiliate this service provider is pretty strict on affiliate links so be careful!Overall Mailchimp is a provider that does a lot of things decently, although they\u2019re not a standout in any category. If you have more specialized needs, we recommend an ESP that is more suited for your particular market.Tip: If you just need a general newsletter, you don\u2019t need advanced functionality, or you\u2019re starting out, Mailchimp is a good option for you. Once you have to start paying for Mailchimp (past their free tier) it\u2019s best to move to a more sophisticated ESP.SummaryHopefully after reading this you are much more knowledgable on what you need to look for to find the best email provider for YOU. People will make recommendations based on their affiliate links and what not but you just need to take a step back and think of that provider offers everything I need?If you have a provider you are doing that you think should be mentioned on this list, let us know in the comments and we can add it!", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "What is a Viral Giveaway?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/how-to-set-up-a-viral-giveaway-3def75525ad4?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2016-08-13", "last_modified_date": "2017-12-06", "readtime": "3.02", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "What is a Viral Giveaway?VYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowAug 13, 2016 \u00b7 4 min readEvery business needs sales to survive but unfortunately it is getting harder and harder to convince people to buy a product the first time they see it or visit your website. True direct response is getting harder, especially for companies in SaaS where the product might take a long time to explain. To go from the first exposure to the sale usually requires 4\u20137 touch points.One solution to this is using viral giveaways, which are used to incentive the behavior of sharing and increasing the exposure of your brand to get that introductory touch point with little effort.A viral giveaway works like this:John has a shoe store and wants to giveaway a pair of shoes to incentivize people to sign up to his email list so he can send them deals every week.Sam signs up and enters his email to get 1 entry to win the shoes.On the confirmation page Sam is given a custom link to share with his friends and family, on social or via email for example.When Sam\u2019s friends or family sign up to also win the shoes through his custom link he will get additional entries.As you can see above the methods allow for 1 entrant to refer a whole lot more people.Why You Should Run a Viral GiveawayThe cost per lead is super low (we have seen them as low as $0.05 per email).Using the right giveaway prize can draw in super targeted leads.The entrant is incentivized to share their email and the company gets cheap leads, win win.This strategy can be evergreen, some companies run a monthly giveaway and the giveaway page generates more and more authority month after month.With the use of paid media this strategy is easy to scale.Giveaway Traps to AvoidGiving away prizes not relevant to your niche.Not promoting the giveaway. First 2\u20133 weeks need WORK!Being too self promotional when promoting.How to Set Up a Viral GiveawayChoose a prize that is relevantThis is extremely important and we see first time giveaway users choose prizes that do not make sense. For example a dentistry giving away an iPad. The prize needs to be complimentary to what you sell so your giveaway entries are aligned with your business and can be converted at a later date. Read more about choosing the right prize here.Plan your outreachThis step is extremely important. You will need to email other influencers and ask for their help in promoting your giveaway. It is usually best to send this out to your industry friends and remember that the favor will be reciprocal.Leverage your current audience.Just because you already have someone\u2019s email, doesn\u2019t mean you can not leverage this person further. Your email list and social media are a great place to start. If you have a segmented list of passionate super fans email them separately with a more person message (these are the guys that will make or break a giveaway). Even though you already have your email lists\u2019 emails, they are likely to know others just like them who they can share the giveaway with.LaunchThis is the easiest step, hit the launch button, send out all your outreach emails, post to all of your social media and blast your email list. All of these steps have been pre planned so shouldn\u2019t take too long.Manage your entriesAs the giveaway builds momentum, check-in on the types of emails you are getting. Look at the source referring most traffic and find other sites or influencers like that to reach out to.Continue to promoteIt is a good idea to start with a media spend on your giveaway. This gets the ball rolling and shows your giveaway to the right audience from the get go. The trick is to aim for a low CPC and use pixels or goals to track the sign ups a paid media channel is driving. We usually start out by publishing some ads on Facebook, Stumble, LinkedIn, Reddit and Twitter.Sooo ready to take the next step?Create your giveaway at VYPER.

Google\u2019s algorithm can tell when a reader is having a good or bad experience on your site, and if you write like a keyword stuffing bot, Google will penalize you (most likely because readers will bounce quickly).Sometimes \u201cweirder\u201d sounding phrases are searched more. For example, \u201centrepreneurial conference\u201d was searched more than \u201cconference for startups\u201d according to Ahrefs.Do your keyword research (using tools like ahrefs, google keyword planner, longtail pro) before you decide to optimize for a phrase that you \u201cthought\u201d was going to be more popular.Text optimization is more important than image optimization for ranking.12 Principles Of Viral Content by Nadya KhojaInfographics, especially ones that cite popular culture, tend to go viralEspecially if you show data in a more interesting format.

He acquired the business from Sujan Patel, another well-known marketer in the digital marketing space. Before being the head honcho at Single Grain, he was the marketing lead for Treehouse, one of the most well-known companies in the tech education space.He also owns Growth Everywhere, now one of my favorite podcasts in the startup growth space. I\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed listening to all his interviews with some of the top entrepreneurs in the world.YOUR LINK TEXTNote: This article was originally published on HYPERLUSH, and has been republished here with permission.We got a chance to interview Eric about one of his favorite topics, content marketing. It\u2019s one of the most effective ways to build up a loyal audience, and it\u2019s an extremely good way to build up an email list.What was the challenge coming into Single Grain after working in a company like Treehouse?It\u2019s a completely different company. With Single Grain, we don\u2019t necessarily have anything groundbreaking. We\u2019re a digital marketing agency just like tons of agencies out there. With Treehouse, we had a great team and a great product and we were on the cutting edge of the education space. Our team at Single Grain is also a different team \u2014 we have a lot of smart people at Single Grain but they\u2019re mostly junior marketers. It was unlike Treehouse where we had the A-class team with people from places like Stanford & Google. So it\u2019s a different challenge.Let\u2019s get into content marketing. How does one even get started?There\u2019s one really important thing that people forget. You have to write for yourself. Write what speaks to you and then go for you. If it\u2019s not interesting for you then you\u2019re not going to help anyone. As Mark Cuban said, \u201cYou try to please everyone, you please no one.\u201dAlso you just gotta keep writing. At the beginning you\u2019re going to see very little returns. It\u2019s a delayed gratification. It\u2019s like compound interest. Over time you\u2019ll see your traffic grow. You\u2019ll see your email list grow.Do you write with SEO in mind?It\u2019s very helpful to understand SEO, but you don\u2019t want to make your writing very robotic by including X amount of keywords in the title or article. It\u2019s important to get traction in your article first and then you can go back and tweak things for SEO purposes.Bottom line: learn the basics of SEO, but don\u2019t worry about over optimization.You have two properties, Single Grain and Growth Everywhere. What\u2019s the purpose of this?I intended to start Growth Everywhere just to give back. When I made it two years ago, I just wanted to make it helpful. But Growth Everywhere does help us send people into our marketing funnels for Single Grain. (Single Grain being the marketing company and Growth Everywhere being just a content blog/podcast for startup growth). We do find that Growth Everywhere brings in our best clients, because they are high value customers who understand more than the average customer and they see the value of what we provide. So in that sense, yes, Growth Everywhere is a great channel for us to find customers for Single Grain.Can you give us traffic numbers for your two properties?Across the board we\u2019re getting around 80,000 unique visitors. About 5% of our audience turns into newsletter subscribers, so we\u2019re getting about 4,000 per month.Wow, that\u2019s pretty high. How are you getting 5% of your readers into newsletter subscribers?I highly recommend ConversionXL for more conversion tips. But our welcome mat from SumoMe is converting super well \u2014 at around 10%. We also have lead magnets that do really well, around 5%.Sumo Me Welcome MatWhat\u2019s doing REALLY well is we have article-specific lead magnets that convert up to 10\u201315%, or commonly called \u201ccontent upgrades.\u201d(Editor\u2019s note, to learn more about content upgrades, check out this post by Backlinko).Did you do A/B testing? And at what point does someone need to do A/B testing?Yes we definitely A/B tested our offers. So generally we tested the actual offers, not the color of the button or something like that.As far as when you should start A/B testing, I have an arbitrary number, 10k uniques. If you don\u2019t have that many yet, then you have much need for A/B testing. And you also have a lot more issues that will take more precedent.You have a site-wide lead magnet called 29 Growth Hacking Quick Wins. How did you come up with this and why did you think it would be a compelling lead magnet?Yeah so the content of that e-book was mostly created by Mattan Griffel of One Month. We were at a conference together and I really liked the content he put together. So I approached him to do the design and he said yes so we created the e-book together.For our audience it was just a no-brainer. If they could get just one good tip from the e-book then it\u2019s worth it for them. We put this lead magnet up on our welcome mat and also throughout our website and it\u2019s been converting a lot better than what was on there before.What\u2019s converting best for you? Welcome mat? Popup? Exit popup?The Welcome Mat by far. So it converts around 10%. We also have an exit popup but it only converts at 1%. I have no idea about the psychology behind it, but the Welcome Mat is just doing so much better. I\u2019d definitely test it out.(Editor\u2019s note: SumoMe themselves have reported similar data. That their Welcome Mat does a lot better than any other pop-up or optin form).How do you promote your content?We find communities that we can post our content to \u2014 places like Growth Hackers and Inbound.org. There\u2019s also Reddit and Hacker News. Then we had our team upvote the content as well. That gave our initial boost of traffic. Then we also interviewed influencers who sent us traffic.Combine that with a mailing list and you slowly end up growing your list and audience pretty quickly.For the people who are having trouble converting their traffic to email subscribers, what should they do?You have to go back to the drawing board and ask yourself if your content is actually good. In general, it\u2019s mostly people who want to take shortcuts and be lazy. When you\u2019re creating content you have to provide value. If it doesn\u2019t provide value then you won\u2019t convert traffic.So take a really deep, hard look at your content and ask yourself if the value you\u2019re providing is actually good. In the past I\u2019ve honestly said \u201cno\u201d to this many times. It\u2019s a learning process. You have to continually create more and more content and figure out what content resonates and what content falls flat.How can we get feedback to see if our content is good or not?Start with friends and family first. Facebook ads can help you see if people want to look at your content. Just look and see which ads get the highest CTR so you can see what people are clicking on and what they like.The great part about this strategy is not only do you get to see what content converts well, but now you can pixel your audience with the FB pixel. Once you have that FB pixel on your site, you can now retarget that audience so they can buy an offer from your site, maybe a cheap offer. Then you can bring them deeper into your funnel and purchase more higher value products.I highly recommend DigitalMarketer.com for more insights on Facebook ads strategy and growth in general.Thanks so much for all the insights Eric!To learn more about Eric Siu, check him out at:Growth EverywhereSingle GrainTwitterOriginally published at VYPER.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/the-best-growth-hackers-in-the-world-arent-necessarily-going-around-teaching-their-skills-211112585c27?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2016-08-20", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-06", "readtime": "6.16", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "VYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowAug 20, 2016 \u00b7 7 min readVincent Dignan: An Underground Growth Hacker\u2019s Tactics to Getting Free TrafficThe best growth hackers in the world aren\u2019t necessarily going around teaching their skills. They\u2019re usually just making tons of money for themselves. A few of them consult with other companies for thousands of dollars per month. That\u2019s what Vincent Dignan was doing for years before he recently decided to reveal his secrets in a tell-all book entitled \u201cSecret Sauce.\u201dThe reason that Vincent has decided to stay underground and not reveal his secrets for so many years is because growth hacking channels die when too many people use them. How many users are now posting inspirational quotes on Instagram to try and \u201cgrowth hack\u201d that platform? How many people are using Auto-DM and Auto-Follow on Twitter? These hacks still work, but they\u2019re no longer as effective since you see it all too commonly now.That\u2019s why to this day, he still doesn\u2019t reveal his best tactics. In fact the people who do reveal their tactics end up making it harder for themselves because those tactics end up overused. The best growth hackers experiment relentlessly to get ahead of the curve, and then exploit the hacks ruthlessly before they\u2019re found out.But we got an exclusive with Vincent to talk about a few of the tactics that are still working now, and how he creatively uses Twitter and other channels to get free targeted traffic for his clients and his own projects.You went from being broke and on welfare 4 years ago, now you\u2019re giving growth hacking talks, how did you gain those skills in that time?Yeah at the time, around 2012, I was homeless living with an ex-girlfriend. I didn\u2019t have my own place and was living off her.My ex told me I needed to go do something. So I decided to make an online magazine since I enjoyed writing and figured I wouldn\u2019t make money blogging off Tumblr. Within 6 months the magazine had 350,000 visitors per month. Within a year it had a million. We raised about $250,000 and got into the Techstars accelerator program. Soon later after that I was giving talks.Wow, amazing. But it sounds like you had no knowledge of the digital world before this. So how did you get up to 350,000 visitors so fast?One of the things I believe is you should learn from one of the best. At the time I wanted to start an online magazine so I talked with a girl who worked for a successful magazine and got advice from her. She told me just get as much traffic as you can \u2014 the rest will fall into place.So the first thing I did was call every University in the country and told them we were building the coolest magazine in the world and would you like to be apart of it. So in essence it was user generated content but we had editors to make the content look good. But the idea is to generate as many articles as possible.Then our strategy was to hit up as many people as possible \u2014 send it through news sites, social communities like Reddit, send it to large publications, send it to people via social media. Our articles got picked up by places like the Huffington Post and other sites like that, which drove massive traffic.We also growth hacked our way with Twitter and got tons of traffic that way (editor\u2019s note, we\u2019ll talk more about Twitter later on in the article).Another thing we did was we used a widget called Zergnet that was essentially a traffic exchange. Every time we send them 1 visitor they send us 2 back. So that was extremely good.You eventually made the transition from PlanetIvy to a growth hacking consultancy called Magnific, why?We got a lot of offers from other companies to learn how we were doing what we were doing. All the stuff we learned growing our Twitter, growing our traffic, that\u2019s stuff that companies wanted. The offers were too good to pass up. It made sense at that point to turn Planet Ivy into our own agency, Magnific.Another main reason for the transition \u2014 when we started in 2012, it was easier to get advertising dollars from publishing. Even with a lot of traffic, an ad-supported website is getting harder to do, especially now with Facebook dominating online advertising. Now Facebook has such a monopoly on traffic that most publications just can\u2019t compete with that kind of targeting and reach.At the same time I still work on side projects just to keep myself interested while I\u2019m helping clients grow their businesses. Secret Sauce, my book has been my biggest project this year. We wanted to create something for the people that can\u2019t afford our services, which cost thousands of dollars. I also created a Facebook group called \u201ctraffic and copy,\u201d which now has a few thousand people.You have a book on Kickstarter that was recently funded successfully (to the tune of $80k+). What was your marketing process for getting sales off Kickstarter?We first compiled a list of several different marketing channels then we arranged them from easiest to hardest.The list looked something like this:Compile a list of people we know and let them know about the book \u2014 Linkedin contacts, Twitter, email contacts.Accelerators and coworking spaces that I\u2019ve talked at, I asked them to send things out to their newsletter. These all have pretty good newsletters that are tech/startup focused.Hacker News \u2014 we couldn\u2019t do this channel as well.Posts on Reddit did really well \u2014 self posts. (Editor\u2019s note: Use Reddit converter to convert your blogs into self posts formatted for Reddit).Posting in Facebook groups.Interviewed on about 8 podcasts, get them to do interviews like this one.Reached out to some influencers to try and get referrals, although this didn\u2019t help as much.Did talks throughout America during the launch.Our pre-existing mailing list.My partner Austin wrote a Medium article that got a lot of traffic.Then send them to a queueing system, we used Queue At to do this. You got a free chapter of the book if you signed up. This queue system asked you to share the book\u2019s landing page in exchange for moving up the queue. As you moved up the queue you could get free webinars, free consultancies, free blog posts about your company, etc. This was definitely the key to the whole thing since it gave us a lot of viral shares.Then we launched and we made about $15,000 from the first day, and now over $80,000 from Kickstarter.You\u2019ve done a lot of growth hacking around Twitter. Can you share the basics about how you use Twitter for traffic?First of all I signed up several different accounts. I recommend beginners to start with 4 accounts \u2014 you could do it like @company_name, @company_help, @company_usa, @company_country \u2014 something like that.Then make sure you\u2019re tweeting a LOT. I tweet on all my accounts every 30 minutes. Twitter isn\u2019t like Facebook. You need repetition to get your content out there.I have an intern Tweeting for me.I don\u2019t use automation currently, but in the past I\u2019ve used Audiense to automate the replies.I follow people with certain attributes. Currently this isn\u2019t automated because my intern does it, although there are tools like Follow Liker that can do that for you.Find a conference going on in your niche and follow those people. They\u2019re super active so they tend to follow back.Don\u2019t follow more than 500 people a day & unfollow more than 400 people a day.Don\u2019t send more than 250 tweets a day.I post and find interesting content.How did you start getting a lot of speaking engagements? That\u2019s sort of a growth hack in itself isn\u2019t it?Yeah I was randomly asked to talk at an accelerator and they were going to pay me for it. From there it was just by referral. Someone there wanted me to talk at another place, and then so on and so forth.One other thing I did to get speaking engagements was just hit up the organizer to various startup meetups in my area (through Meetups.com), give them a deck I had on growth hacking, and do a cold email asking if I could speak.You mention on your site that forums are where you learn real growth hacks. What forums do you go on?BlackHatWorld.com. It\u2019s black hat but they have a lot of amazing tactics on there.The thing with blackhat, of course, is that the hacks don\u2019t really last, but they\u2019ll be doing stuff that gets them tons of traffic for a time, until Google finds out and destroys it. So you can\u2019t make a real business out of it, but you can get some temporary wins from Blackhat.However, the site itself has actually tons of really good advice that\u2019s not Blackhat, so I recommend people checking it out.What\u2019s a last growth hack you want to share with our audience?The key really is knowing that there are tools out there for anything. A lot of stuff can be automated and a lot of knowledge and info can be scraped.CharlieApp \u2014 Finds anyone\u2019s info.Audiense \u2014 Automated Twitter/Instagram mentions and scrape Twitter/Instagram for certain keywords.Email Hunter \u2014 Find email addresses.Depending on what you\u2019re trying to achieve, there\u2019s going to be a way for you to reach people without spending a lot of time or money.Check out more of Vincent Dignan:His book Secret Sauce on IndieGogoVincentDignan.comMagnific agencyTwitterOriginally published at vyper.io on August 20, 2016.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Growth Hacking", "Startup", "Traffic", "Vincent Dignan"]}, {"title": "10 Brilliant B2B Facebook Ads Deconstructed", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/10-brilliant-b2b-facebook-ads-deconstructed-fa0c8e693084?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2016-11-14", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-20", "readtime": "10.6", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "10 Brilliant B2B Facebook Ads DeconstructedVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowNov 14, 2016 \u00b7 11 min readHow do online businesses get more customers? Simple, they advertise the features of their product or service and provide value. Sounds easy right?Not so fast, I forgot to mention you have to compete against almost every other business trying to also win over your customers attention.So how do you get the attention of your potential customers and beat out your competitors.Simple, you run engaging, value add Facebook ads!This is the basic flow of an awesome lead generation machine.-> Facebook Ad \u2192 Valuable Content / Sales Page \u2014 -> Free Content Upgrade / Lead Bait \u2014 \u2192 Email Drip \u2014 \u2014 -> Lifelong Customer / Reader :)Below is a number of Facebook ads that I tear apart and pinpoint the things these companies did right and the things they royally f \u2018d up. I will share what makes some of these the best Facebook ads in their niche.So How Have These B2B Companies Created The Best Facebook Ads?Facebook Ad 1 \u2014 FoxleyLanding Page \u2014 https://members.foxley.com/393-webinarThe Pros to This AdText \u2014 They are using [brackers] to draw you attention the most important aspect of the ad, the FREE video training they want you to sign up to.Image \u2014 There is a huge amount of eye contact which grabs people\u2019s attention and the use of yellow in the background and CTA draw your attention to click the image which then redirects to the ads final URL.The Cons to This AdText \u2014 They did not include a link in the ad text for an extra CTA option, this also makes the post look a little more organic even though they went way overboard on the CAPS.Image \u2014 The text in the image is well over theFacebook Ad 2 \u2014 Lead QuizzesLanding Page \u2014 http://lps.leadquizzes.com/the-3-types-of-quiz-funnels-1The Pros to This AdText \u2014 They are using statistics and numbers to lure you in to find out more. This is a great technique to tie in with case studies, educational content and in this case a webinar as well.Image \u2014 The color definitely stands out in the news feed and makes people stop and read. Using interesting looking people is a great tactic for grabbing someone\u2019s attention (e.g. strange hair color, covered in tattoos, doing a strange pose, body out of proportion etc).The Cons to This AdText \u2014 For business owners 50,000 leads to only generate $100k is not that good, that\u2019s only $2 AOV (average order value) or rev per lead and it does not say how much it cost to acquire a customer.They should have left this at 50,000 leads or used $100k/m in revenue.Image \u2014 The image is super strong but the copy in the image lets this ad down. The text is not very interesting and a bit of a sell out that the secret is their own product. It should have been tied in with the text \u201cMy Secret to Generating 50k leads in 1 month?\u201d then CTA \u2014 \u201cLearn How\u201d.Facebook Ad 3 \u2014 Neil PatelLanding Page \u2014 http://neilpatel.com/podcast/The Pros to This AdText \u2014 This sponsored post is a much more organic looking ad. The text is long and can be expanded as well as including more of a pain point/story instead of a direct response sales pitch.Image \u2014 Neil is lucky enough to be able to use images of himself to get clicks as one of his strongest assets is the personal brand he has built around himself. Again this image plays on the more organic looking feel as an image like this looks like a post from a friend not a company trying to take your money.Again this image plays on the more organic looking feel as an image like this looks like a post from a friend, not a company trying to take your money.The Cons to This AdText -This looks to be a boosted link post as there is no CTA almost all of the text is getting cut off. Get familiar with the character limits from Facebook and try and stick to them when writing/ editing link titles and text.Image -Even though this is an image of Neil which holds a lot of authority, the image could have been more focused on him. Meaning a more neutral/solid color background, less blurred towards the bottom of the image.The landscape sizing was also a bad choice, this image should have been square which allows more space to be taken up in the news feed.Facebook Ad 4 \u2014 Fatboy MarketingLanding Page \u2014 https://www.fatboyinc.com/blog/how-to-not-suck-at-google-adwordsThe Pros to This AdText \u2014 This Facebook ad has a fantastic emotional appeal, nobody wants to suck at something and it immediately grabs your attention as the viewer takes offense and it provokes emotion.The copy is also extreamly direct in the goal ofImage \u2014 There is a huge amount of eye contact which grabs people\u2019s attention and the use of yellow in the background and CTA draw your attention to click the image which then redirects to the ads final URL.The Cons to This AdText \u2014 Not a huge amount of cons here but they could have made the call to action a little strong. They build up the emotion and pain point but really tell you to click on the ad to solve it. This may be obvious to mostThis may be obvious to most but always better to base than sorry. Remember, you want to tell the viewer what the pain point is (get in their mindset, they need to relate) and then tell them why/how you are going to solve it for them.Image \u2014 The \u201chow to\u201d could have been a little bigger and still stayed within the 20% (meaning they would not get penalized. The other observation is not to use the colors similar to the Facebook blue. Your ads tend to blend and get lost in the platform.Facebook ad 5 \u2014 Digital MarketerLanding Page -The Pros to This AdText \u2014 Again this ad is using statistics to add credibility. They are also very confident and to the point about what they are offing.Image \u2014 They draw your attention the title straight away with the red banner. They are also aligning the text really well with the image using the \u201clibrary\u201d theme.The Cons to This AdText -They could have positioned this a little more towards a question e.g. \u2014 \u201cWant to see and copy the exact ads that we used to generate 400k+ leads and millions of dollars?\u201d. People want the get rich quick method (copy someone or something) most of the time so you need to give it to them!Image \u2014 The image is very busy, if possible they could have spaced it out a little more and added a strong shadow under the red banner to make it pop forward. Using eye illusions is fantastic in ads. Check here for some inspiration.Facebook ad 6 \u2014 Posi RankLanding Page 6 \u2014 http://www.trendmicro.com/aws/devsecops/The Pros to This AdText \u2014 The ad creates a ton of curiosity if this is served to a super targeted audience that understands the backlink ecosystem they have done a good job in encouraging a click to learn more.Image \u2014 Very clever and creative ad image, the use of flat images has made it a lot easier to get messaging across through visuals. This is a much better approach than a stock image of a guy at a computer smiling.The Cons to This AdText \u2014 These guys missed a huge opportunity to use the ad text section. They definitely should have used this as it is not really clear what you are clicking to receive or see.This ad does create mystery however not a great job a pre-qualifying the user. You can either target a wide audience with a general ad for top of the funnel traffic (usually expensive) or create a targeted ad/audience to prequalify people (usually cheaper if done right).Image \u2014 People know that is probably an ad by looking at the \u201csponsored\u201d tag and they are probably targeting tech savvy people. But the logo in the top left is completely out of place and does not fit into the image at all. This is a huge red light for people clicking as it decreases their creative design credibility.If you are going to add a logo to our images for branding make them subtle. This logo takes the users attention away from the messaging of the ad and makes them notice the logo tag straight away.Facebook ad 7 \u2014 Trend MicroLanding Page 7 \u2014 http://www.trendmicro.com/aws/devsecops/The Pros to This AdText \u2014 This is a super interesting ad as they are going above and beyond with the \u201chook\u201d. They offer a reward and prompt the browser to \u201ctest\u201d their knowledge which actually means fill out a survey for us!Image \u2014 You can see that his brand has done a much better job at integrating their logo. They have also integrated messaging within the image. The quiz is provoked by the thinking pilot, they have also connected the dots with cloud security and an everyday understandable industry.The Cons to This AdText \u2014 They needed to define AWS a little more and also include why cloud security is important. They needed to make the user care about cloud security, using fear probably would have been the best in this case.e.g. Worried about your website being hacked? , Is your website safe? , Is your website protecting your customer\u2019s personal information?Image \u2014 This is a fantastic image for this ads as it has all the bells and whistles to get someone to click. The only thing they messed up was pilot not looking at the CTA. If they had just lowered the pilot a little more in the image so his line of sight was pointing towards the CTA they would have nailed it!Facebook ad 8 \u2014 I Love SaaSLanding Page 8 \u2014 http://www.moneypath.com/saas-funnel-metrics-gogThe Pros to This AdText \u2014 This ad has used past accomplishments as a validator. An ad can be similar to a resume in the fact that you have to tell your audience what you have achieved and how you can help them.Image \u2014 This ad has also used a more personal approach by making himself the figure of the business. He has also carried the image from the landing page to the ad so the funnel has a logical flow.The Cons to This AdText \u2014 The text has not been split out into paragraphs. The book is free but this is not included the in the main title. It has included that a 10 question survey is required. This sounds like a chore compared to a lead magnet. It should have been positioned as a 2minIt should have been positioned as a 2min quiz to find out your Saas companies key metrics. The quiz could have been the driving point of this ad to add value. Instead, it is positioned as a barrier to get the free content.Image \u2014 Even though the ad is personal and carries through to the landing page he should have used a set image not a screenshot from the video. Or even included teh video as the ad to speed up the funnel and ad value faster. Facebook also give more reach to video content over image content.Facebook ad 9 \u2014 PercolateLanding Page 9 \u2014 https://percolate.com/request-demoThe Pros to This AdText \u2014 This ad has hit the pain point jackpot, most people hate spreadsheets and find them extremely painful and time-consuming. For this fact alone if you work in a business you are interested. The question also creates interest.Image \u2014 They have used a carousel that gives you more information before the click.The Cons to This AdText \u2014 They have duplicated the copy across all the carousel images which is a huge wasted opportunity. This could have been a section to explain the product more or highlight the key benefits of the software.Image \u2014 Even though they have the right idea to add more imagery they have gone with some pretty boring stock looking images that are not really going to drive interest.They could have made the carousel into a storyboard showing the person with the pain (you) and then the service being the solution to that pain point.Facebook ad 10 \u2014 Click FunnelsLanding Page 10 \u2014 https://dotcomsecretslabs.com/free-bookThe Pros to This AdText \u2014 This ad has so many value bombs in it (statistics that scare you, free product and testimonial). This copy is bound to stop anyone who has a website and knows that conversion rate and sales are key success factors for their business.It also scares the browser by stating that 1 word decreased converions by 31%. Browsers thought process goes \u201cWait a second, do I also have 1 word costing me 30% of my revenue\u201d.Image \u2014 Unlike the ad above Click Funnels has used the video on option and boy do they have a lot of engagement on this ad which means it is probably working and they have a super cheap CPC and CPA.Remember in terms of engagement \u201cshares are the golden goose\u201d.The Cons to This AdText \u2014 Hard to find many things wrong with this one but the title is probably the weakest point. They could have made it a little more impactful by using the stats in the text or playing into the fear of something costing you 30% of your sales.Something like \u201cFind Out Why this Landing Page Decreased my Sales by 31%\u201dImage \u2014 Again this ad could have used an image instead of a screen grab from the video. You can add text to the image and come across as a little more authoritative. Remember to keep your first frame of a video under 20% text.So now you have a pretty good understanding of what makes the best Facebook ads work. The key takeaways are.Always try and use emotion to encourage a clickYour image has the largest statistical difference when testing adsUsing faces and humans can make your ads more relatableAlways identify a pain pointRemember all the browser/potential customer wants to know is how you can save them time or money.If you run your own Facebook ads definitely check out the FREE offer below as it will drastically help improve your CPA\u2019s and CPC\u2019s.Get Access To Our Facebook Hacks Video Library.Click HERE!Originally published at VYPER.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "13 Ways To Growth Hack Using Viral Leaderboard Contests", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/13-ways-to-growth-hack-using-viral-leaderboard-contests-150169e12a22?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2017-07-09", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-06", "readtime": "8.91", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "13 Ways To Growth Hack Using Viral Leaderboard ContestsVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowJul 9, 2017 \u00b7 9 min readSummary \u2014 Growth hacking is a hyped word. It is loosely defined as a generating growth from less effort by working smart and creative, not hard.We created a list of 13 innovative ways to leverage viral contest leaderboards will help you become an elite growth hacker. Each of these hacks will help you get more traffic, leads, sales and brand awareness.Contests, giveaways, sweepstakes and whatever else you can name them have become a key growth hacking acquisition strategy in a lot of online businesses. Customers are getting smarter and harder to market to. You\u2019ll need to innovate your marketing strategies in order to reach them, and the viral leaderboard contest can help.Do you need\u2026?More trafficMore leadsMore salesMore awarenessOf course you do! Keep reading to find out how viral contests do it.Basics of a contestRewarding someone for entering their information and completing an action (like referring a friend).A lot of contests are based on a points system. E.g. do X and get Y number of points. These points then rank the entrants in a leaderboard.The more tempting you make this offering the easier the acquisition of will be.Great offer + great audience = viral contest!So lets drive in and take a look at all the ways people are growth hacking their way to more leads, traffic and sales using viral leaderboard contests.1. Social follower contestEveryone knows that a large social following is almost a prerequisite for online business validation. We also know that the value of a Facebook follower is decreasing. So instead of paying thousands of dollars building your social following, you can launch a contest and ask users to follow your social media pages.By rewarding extra points for entrants to follow your page, you will have a large following in no time.TIP \u2014 Make sure what you are giving away is aligned with your business so that your entrants are focused to your niche. If you\u2019re giving away a $500 cash reward, the chances are you will get a pretty general following that probably doesn\u2019t care about your company. If you are in the golf niche and offer the latest golf clubs, chances are your entrants are going to be more targeted.2. Email lead contestEmails are a vital part to most business, it\u2019s a direct contact with your customer is always a great starting point no matter what you are selling (products, content or services). Using gamification in the form of a points system sparks the competitiveness in humans.This email collection contest is the easiest to execute on and it pretty much rewards entrants with more points every time they refer a new person to your contest. Awards are given to people with the most points.TIP \u2014 Giving multiple prizes helps to make your contest even more competitive. A lot of people don\u2019t think they can win 1st place if the winner is too far ahead, but if there are enough consolation prizes to make it interesting, they\u2019re more likely to participate.3. Joint venture contestMake your contest more interesting and valuable by introducing a complementary brand, product to partner. This will give you more to offer in terms of prizes as well as help in the promotion and marketing of your contest.TIP \u2014 Try using influencers to promote your contest. You are able to leverage their audience as well as use them as a validator that your contest is worth entering. People are much more likely to take a recommendation from a friend, family member, colleague or influencer than the brand itself!For example, one of our clients, Fatburger, teamed up with Wal Mart to do a joint giveaway, which lended the brand a lot of social validation.4. Waiting listWaiting is never fun but turn a negative into a positive with a waiting list contest. Promote a page that announces the release of XX (whatever people are waiting for) and have people sign up for the waiting list. Once they are signed up they can then see where they are in line!You can incentives people to move up the line by referring others to the list, get them to follow your social media or get them to complete custom actions like watch a video, join a Facebook group or complete a quiz!This is great for keeping your brand in the spotlight and building hype before your release or launch date.TIP \u2014 Make sure you send out a reminder close to when you are ready to open the doors to your waiting list to get them excited again. This is also a great time to reward everyone on the list with a gift (discount, free item, bonus content etc).5. Product launchSimilar to the contest above but more focused on the release of a product. Since this is a product it allows you to get a little more creative with your rewards. For example, if you were releasing a new product (e.g. a power bank) you could give the top 10 entrants a free power bank and anyone who reached 5000 pints 50% off!This incentivizes people to collect more points by sharing your contest, following your social accounts or completing custom actions you set!TIP \u2014 The better you make the grand prize the more people will want to share your contest to get points. We suggest running this about 30 days prior to your release date. Once you get to your release date you should have a huge list of emails to market to as well!6. Course launchThis one is pretty self-explanatory after the prior contest type. Use all the same principles but for your course. You can offer free course chapters, lifetime access or 1on1 training sessions as rewards in your launch contest.TIP \u2014 Try and run a few friends through your course first to get feedback and get some testimonials to use on the course launch page. This will validate the course and make the prize of wining more enticing.7. Evergreen funnelThis is one of people\u2019s favorite contest types as it is a constant stream of leads. A contest is set up to run constantly rewarding winners every week/month or quarter. The idea of this is to keep a constant steam of traffic running to this contest page to keep it alive. Here is an example of how we run an evergreen contest \u2014 https://vyper.io/c/199TIP \u2014 Add a link to your evergreen costed from a website popup/tab, Facebook page tab, Instagram bio, include it in your email prospecting drip and even in your paid acquisition.8. Product / Facebook Page ReviewsGetting positive product reviews is a fantastic way to improve your conversion rate. People love seeing validation on a product they are about to purchase. You can use a custom contest entry to incentivize a product review.TIP \u2014 It\u2019s best to do this only for people who have actually bought your product, otherwise it\u2019s unethical. You can make this more legitimate by making the custom entry question the receipt number of their purchase or their email they used at time of purchase.9. Survey/Quiz ContestGetting customers/browsers feedback can be tricky but we still do it as it is some of the most important information we can obtain to grow our business. Leverage contest to incentivize that feedback, everyone needs a little motivation. Reward points on completing aLeverage contests to incentivize that feedback, everyone needs a little motivation. Reward points on completing a Google form or completing a single answer question (see below), it will help them get closer to winning the contest and get you your much-needed data.TIP \u2014 The feedback can be on your website design, product, industry, information about them to help you build personas on the people who are interested in your brand. Also think about sweetening the deal by having a discount code at the end of the contest. This also drives a few sales as well ;)10. Crowd Sourcing (Kickstarter)Everyone seems to be crowed souring something these days, a trip around the world, a new business venture or new product. But how do you make yours stand out? The hardest part about crowed sourcing is getting eyeballs on your project.Use a contest to generate hype, drive traffic, collect emails and build audiences. You can award people who back your project, share it, watch your product video & more. The possibilities are endless.You can also run a contest before even launching your Kickstart so that when you launch you already have an email list to market to.TIP \u2014 Tier your contest rewards similar to ho you would for a Kickstarter. Once a contestant gets X amount of points they get Y. Also make sure you have some low entry rewards to keep people motivated. E.g. get 10% OFF when you reach 500 points.11. Social Proof Contest (get cheap likes, shares & comments)This is one of the most powerful but underutilized features of contests. The ability to incentivize someone to like, share and comment on a Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn post is worth hundreds if not thousands of dollars.Not only does this make your post look extremely popular but you can pin this to the top of your page so when people visit your page it looks like you have some serious engagement. Social engagement is like word of mouth, e.g. \u201cJack liked this so I should too\u201d.TIP \u2014 Use this tactic on your Facebook ads to get better quality scores and make your ads look more authoritative. A combination of leaderboard contest + lots of social validation + Facebook ads is a slam dunk for growth!12. Video engagement contest (YouTube & GB)YouTube is a huge opportunity that is extremely hard to break into, there are hundreds of minutes of video uploaded every 60 seconds so how do you make your videos stand above the rest? You game the algorithms by incentivizing comments, likes, and subscribers on your videos.Nothing moves you up the search results in YouTube faster than comment engagement so make sure you also reply to those comments as well to get some conversations started.TIP \u2014 In the custom entry of your leaderboard contest ask a question instead of just asking entrants to thumbs up your YouTube video. E.g. For 100 points, watch this YouTube video and ask 1 question in the comments\u201d. This will make the comments seem a little more organic!13. Create custom audiences for FacebookNot enough people use custom audiences on Facebook for hyper-targeted campaigns. Once you please a pixel on the contest landing page and thank you page your can start building an audience in Facebook. With this audience you can push specific offers to that targeted audience or create \u201clook-a-like\u201d audiences to find people similar to those who entered your contest.TIP \u2014 once your contest ends, run a Facebook campaign with the messaging. \u201cThanks for entering our contest, sorry you didn\u2019t win but we don\u2019t want you to miss out. So here is a 50% off coupon code that is valid for the next 48 hours\u201d.

If everyone shares, it inevitably benefits everyone involved.If no one shares, no one benefits so pick good partners and have a series of emails ready to send your partners.

It has been the most effective way for him to build and push users through the social followers -> email subscriber -> paying customer funnel.Why did you decide to run a contest? We love running contests and viral launch campaigns for our clients as a way of turning social media followers into email subscribers and eventually into paying customers.Problems you were facing? We\u2019d tried and tested running social traffic to landing pages, which were converting fine, but we wanted to amplify the social audiences, and found that viral competitions are a very effective way to do this.Growth needed? Clients would come to us asking us to grow their email lists by thousands of subscribers, and they wanted to achieve this at the lowest possible cost. This is quite a daunting task when there is little momentum or acquisition infrastructure in place.What expectations and goals did you have/set for your contest? We are generally aiming to get 3,000+ email subscribers from a viral contest of this nature and to send the subscribers and offer which will convert them into customers.What other marketing campaigns have you tried but didn\u2019t work? We have tried using Gleam.io & Matire App which are great tools in their own right, but found that conversion and virality were higher when using VYPER.Contest example results:Justin Bieber Tickets ContestEmails: 8,178+Social followers: 5,000+Customers: 100+ app downloadsSocial media mentions increased exponentially.Evil Energy ContestEmails: 6,594+Social followers: 3,000+Traffic increase: 1,000+ website clicks during contest periodWhat are the top 5 things you learned from running a contest? We\u2019ve setup and promoted a lot of these contests. Some work better than others.Viral contests are a great way to turn social media followers into email subscribers.Seeding contests with an existing email list can help a lot get you started.Not every contest you setup is going to be a sure-fire success.The more entries you get, the more viral the contest seems to go.Sending email blasts mid-competition is a great way to boost the viral effect and bump up entry numbers. The more entries you have, the bigger the effect of a follow up email will be.What would you do next time you ran a contest?Send big email blasts to pre-existing lists as soon as the contest launches.Drive traffic through mass tweeting at relevant people.Get as much PR and influencer shoutouts to the campaign as possible. PR has been a great way to get high quality leads.Ask for feedback on the contest page from customers & others before launching.Use the new custom entries tools to get more information from entrants.How did you promote your contest and what worked the best for you? We\u2019ve promoted and cross-promoted contests on lots of different channels. We try to promote through as many channels as possible simultaneously to get the contest going.Once you get momentum the contest really starts to accelerate!What has worked the best:Email a solid pre-subscribed list (+Get others to email it out for you) \u2014 We\u2019ve found email to be a really good source of signups, especially if they\u2019re already on your list. Cold email generally gets much lower conversion rates than emailing a subscribed list.Twitter \u2014 We build networks of 10+ Twitter accounts, build nice followers and send tweets and DM\u2019s to the followers telling them about the contest.Instagram \u2014 We\u2019ve built niche accounts and DM the followers to tell them about the contest. It works ok, but if you start sending too much traffic from too many accounts via DM\u2019s the accounts can get shut down or suspended.LinkedIn \u2014 Building up networks of connections and telling them about the contest via direct message and published pulse blog posts.Paid traffic via Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram etc. \u2014 We see an opportunity with viral contests to reduce CPA by sending ads to VYPER\u2019s contest landing pages, collecting Facebook pixels for retargeting all the people who land on the page (and those who sign up), and also trying to convert them with an opt-in bribe as soon as they sign up for the contest.Facebook Groups \u2014 We\u2019ve tried a lot of stuff with Facebook groups. Where we\u2019ve had most success is building relationships with the people who own the groups and getting them to post the link into the group as they already have authority there.PR \u2014 We\u2019ve also found that high quality PR can boost the number of high quality relevant signups.Competition directories \u2014 Quality of entrants drops from this source but it\u2019s a good way to get the word out to a lot of people quickly.About the Agency Digital Growth are an international Growth Agency focused on building social media audiences on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn & Instagram.

Most are too focused on the technical or they go too copy heavy to make any real impact. That is why marketers are encouraged to adopt a technique that has been used for centuries to entertain, educate, and inform. Storytelling is a powerful marketing tool that can make your landing pages stand out and get noticed.A good story is often remembered more clearly than mere facts. So, if you can weave a good tale, even the most technical of brands might find the secret to maximum conversions. Here are a few tips you can use on your landing pages that will bring your brand\u2019s story to life.Determine the Story\u2019s PurposeWhat are you trying to accomplish with your landing page? That answer should be provided before any storytelling is developed. You should have a clear ending in mind before you begin, in other words, and it all begins with a goal.Are you trying to entice a purchase or a subscription? This goal should be written down and looked at often so that the story always stays on track.What\u2019s the Problem?Prospects click on your landing page because some promise enticed them. They may have clicked an ad that promised to make their job easier. They may have clicked a Facebook post or clicked a link in an ebook that swore their lives could be simpler. Now they have landed on your landing page with hopes of finding this ease-of-life you\u2019ve assured.Just as you have written down the goal of the landing page, write down the prospect\u2019s problem. This is the issue that will be top-of-mind as the reader engages with your story. That is why every line must address that problem as well as its solution \u2014 in some fashion.Start Your Story with a Striking TitleYour titles can\u2019t just be good. They have to be like coiled vipers, lashing out and Striking readers, forcing them to pay attention. This type of title:Speaks to the prospects\u2019 problem. (Client Onboarding Just Got Easier & Less Expensive)Tells the prospect that a story is forthcoming. (How One Business Owner Expanded His Business in 4 Months!)Makes a promise. (Join This Business Owner Who Expanded His Enterprise in Less Than Six-Months!)Gives facts & figures. (How One Business Owner Increased Sales By 154% in Four Months!)Gets Personal. (Stop the Frustration of Client Onboarding. Finally, an Easier Solution that Costs Less!)Uses a combination of tactics. (Client Onboarding Success Secrets. 85% Faster Results and Ease-of-Use for Frustrated HR Reps)Use Simple LanguageNothing will take a reader out of a story faster than using a convoluted word that doesn\u2019t belong. Instead of saying, \u201cSusan passed the required standardization procedures that ensured her knowledge of the material was commensurate\u2026\u201d which could cause your reader to doze off, say, \u201cSusan passed all the required tests, and now has the knowledge she needs\u2026\u201dIn other words, avoid jargon and speak as though you were telling this story to a friend. And never use a long word when a short one will do.Who is Your Subject?A good story needs a protagonist; someone we can root for. Some examples might be:The owner of the company describing how he/she came across the secrets to the organization\u2019s success. (Tim didn\u2019t know at the time, but the algorithm he developed has helped 4,506 small businesses save more money with better personnel and fewer liability issues.)A client who has a success story to tell. (John expanded his boat rental business, opened a new location, and recently hired twenty new staff members.)Third-parties who have decided to work with the organization. (A corporate leasing agency chose to team up with a B2B SEO firm, for instance, because of the SEO\u2019s values, culture, and methods with which they do business.)Get to the PointThe average person spends 8 hours per day consuming various types of media. To get your brand noticed, your landing pages have to hook the reader instantly. There\u2019s no time to waste. \u201cOnce upon a time\u2026\u201d isn\u2019t going to cut it and long drawn out introductions won\u2019t either.Instead, take a page from an actual master of writing, Kurt Vonnegut, that teaches you to start as close to the end of your story as possible.Did your service help a client expand his boat rental business ten-fold in the past year? Think about why that would be interesting to a prospect.If the prospect is a business owner who also wants to expand, describe all the benefits the client now experiences with the newly developed business.For instance, \u201cJohn Weaver started the year with one struggling boat rental business and too much inventory he couldn\u2019t quite move. Within four months, John cleared through his inventory, expanded his business, and opened a second location on the other side of town.\u201dIn this way, you are enticing your audience by helping them enjoy the fruits of John\u2019s labor. The reader can put him/herself in John\u2019s shoes, and will start to imagine it would be like to experience that sweet, sweet success.Keep Your Organization Out of ItPeople reading your landing pages don\u2019t care about your organization, how it got started, and who works there; at least not yet. Right now, the reader is focused on how you can solve his or her problem.When writing a story on your landing pages, put the focus all on the ideal prospects. Speak to that person and make him or her feel the emotional pain caused by this ever-present problem. Maybe it\u2019s frustration or anger, or regret for doing things the hard way for so many years. Eventually, you will mention the solution to the prospects\u2019 problem, which will represent the easier way of doing things. First, you need to create an emotional bond.Some excellent ways to personalize your stories so that they more deeply resonate with your target market is to use job titles, photographs of people engaged in similar job roles, quotes from others in the industry, and by using lots of \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d to drive your copy home.Give Your Clients the Storytelling Duties for a ChangeYou don\u2019t always have to be the one telling the story. Empowering stories told from the viewpoint of clients helps to build that strong emotional bond you\u2019re striving for. The best way to do this is to have the client tell his or her story in person or on a recording. Face-to-face Skype or Google Hangout interviews work well also. No matter which medium is used, record the client\u2019s story, transcribe the words, and convert the juiciest parts into powerful landing page copy that gets your prospects excited about your offerings.When using testimonials, pair them with relevant blocks of copy. For instance, if your landing page is discussing how easy your software is to use, that\u2019s an excellent place to drop a testimonial where one of your clients raves about ease-of-use.In this sense, testimonials act as exclamation points that highlight the exciting bits of your story.Be Relentless with Your EditingKurt Vonnegut gave another interesting tidbit marketers would be keen to follow. He said that every sentence of your story should do one of two things \u2014 reveal something about your character or advance the action.As a landing page marketer, your job is to ensure every line of your story either aligns with your title or pertains to the reader\u2019s problem. If it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s nothing but noise and should be removed at all costs.Format So the Story FlowsKeep in mind that people will be reading your landing pages on small screens. Not all of them, but enough that make it wise to format for mobile first.Formatting tips include:Short, simple sentences, and concise paragraphs with a good bit of space in between.Bolded subheaders that continue the story as the landing page progresses. Your reader should be able to get a gist of what the page contains just by reading the sub-headers alone.Use numbered and bulleted lists wherever possible to make content more digestible.Front load your sentences so that the main idea is early on, and so readers don\u2019t have to read every single word to get by.Your CTA Isn\u2019t the Story\u2019s End. It\u2019s the CliffhangerYour landing page told the story, now your CTA is a way for your prospects\u2019 to create their own stories. Make this part of your call-to-action language. For instance, \u201cDo you want to expand your business like John? Get in touch by filling out the form below and see how John did it.\u201dOr, \u201cStop banging your head against the wall and discover the solution that will save you time, money, and constant frustration. Click the button below and find out how to put this stress-free solution into action starting today!\u201d ConclusionA properly constructed landing page can do wonders for a brand\u2019s bottom line. Sadly, too few brands use storytelling, which is a powerful technique for remaining on your prospects\u2019 minds. You now have the ins and outs of storytelling for landing pages which should have a significant impact on your B2B audience.Author Bio: Ryan Gould is the Vice President of Strategy and Marketing Services at Elevation Marketing, a B2B marketing agency.

Optimizing for purchase conversions can be very difficult at first, but a lead capture campaign is easier to set up and you can get much more value out of it right from the get go.Why do email lead capture campaigns work?You\u2019re going for a much easier conversion (getting their email address), so your advertising dollars don\u2019t go to waste trying to convert for purchases.It\u2019s much easier to setup, and there\u2019s not as much optimization required as you would need if you\u2019re trying to get purchase conversions.Once you have the leads, you can use the Facebook pixel cookie to retarget your customers, which is the #1 most profitable Facebook ads campaign you can run.Emails can be used to build up your audience even when you don\u2019t have a product to target them with. (Great for future product launches.)You offer some kind of valuable freebie that builds brand relationship with your target customer.What are the cons of an email lead capture campaign?You need a strong email marketing drip sequence to activate that customer to purchase.It\u2019s a 2-part conversion, so you need to have your funnel right, otherwise your ads will still be unprofitable.If you can get the purchase with your ads without lead capture, this brings in more direct revenue and it\u2019s easier to measure.Basically if you can get a profitable purchase campaign going, lead capture is a secondary campaign you can run alongside your purchase campaign, but it should be relegated to only a fraction of your budget at this point. (However, if you can\u2019t get a profitable purchase campaign, then the lead capture campaign is king).Let\u2019s get started.What you will learn:How to setup your offer (viral giveaway or lead magnet).How to set up your Facebook ecosystem (pixels, audiences and accounts).How to setup the best Facebook prospecting campaign to get your giveaway generating leads straight out of the gates (starting the snowball). The more momentum you can build the more emails you will generate from your giveaway.How to use Facebook remarketing ads to turn those new visitors into customers and start generating a ROI before your giveaway even ends.Setting up your offerOption 1: Viral Contest + Lead Magnet Combo using VYPERViral contest are like snowballs, once they start rolling they get bigger and bigger and become unstoppable customer acquisition machines!This helps make your lead-gen campaign 2x more profitable, as each lead you acquire via Facebook ads can turn into 1.5 leads on average.Haven\u2019t created a contest yet? Sign up for a VYPER account to immediately to kick start your viral marketing strategy.VYPER also has built in lead magnet delivery (or we call them opt-in bribes).Option 2: Alternatively, you can setup a solo lead magnet.Don\u2019t want to start a giveaway? Awwww.If you just want to offer a solo lead magnet, like a PDF or a coupon, you can do that with tools like Unbounce.This requires a bit of work as you\u2019ll need to design a lead magnet, create your landing page, etc. You can also use a tool like Beacon to create your lead magnets.We highly recommend doing a viral giveaway as it\u2019s pretty cheap/easy to setup and you\u2019re going to get the most signups from this.Basics: Setting up Facebook CorrectlyYou will need to start off with a few basics. The bare minimum you need is a Facebook personal account and a personal ad account BUT we highly suggest following the below steps for setting up your Facebook ecosystem properly by using a Facebook Business account.Below is a list of things you need to do right now:Login to your personal Facebook profile, pretty much everyone has one of these.Get a Facebook business account to get your sh*t organized, create a business account, a few benefits to this type of account is:Add multiple users,Manage multiple ad accounts,Manage multiple Facebook pages,Create multiple Pixels (you can also share these with other accounts as there is 1 pixel ID per ad account)Create product catalogs (used for dynamic product ads)Better Audiences and insights controlHere is an overview of the Facebook business account if you need more convincingCreate a Facebook ad account which is super easy to add within your new Facebook business account manager. You can also easily add your billing information to your ad account once it is set up. Facebook restricts your ad spend to start with and you have to work your way up from a $25 credit limit. They trust NO ONE!If you run into trouble with any of this set up, Facebook has a great support portal that not too many people know about this portal, so the response times are good. You can contact Facebook reps through live chat or email.IMPORTANT: Using pixelsThe reason why Facebook is such a great marketing channel is the use of their Pixels and being able to optimize ads to a specific goal (Pixel \u2014 ie. the signup success page of our giveaway).WTF is a pixel? \u2014 it is a snippet of code that is added to a website page that collects information on the users that views/visits the page. This information is then sent back to Facebook so you can build audiences, track conversions and create look-a-like audiences.Using pixels in your marketing mix is important because we can set ads to optimize to these pixels. Again, in a nutshell, this tells Facebook who to serve our ads to and target people who are most likely to achieve our goal and convert (i.e. get to our signup success page of our giveaway).Pixel breakdown:Below we will go into how to add pixels to our giveaway so don\u2019t worry if this is sounding complicated at the moment, it is super easy!Overview: Facebook Ads ExplainedYou will want to either use the Facebook Ads Manager (basic) or the Facebook Power Editor (advanced) to set up your ads, these are the two different methods for launching ads on Facebook.Power Editor ProsSearch functionality for ads and bulk editingNo BS when setting up adsAdding UTM tags and pixels is easySetting up dynamic product adsCreating canvas adsPower Editor ConsVery hard to gauge ad performance and metricsHorrible for optimizing adsYou kind of have to know what you are doing to use this platformEasy to make mistakesAd Manager ProsEasy UX and definitely a smaller learning curveMuch better metric and optimization selectionFiltering data functions are awesome (age, demo, placement etc.)Very visual for ad creation and steps users through the setupAd Manager ConsSlows down your computer a lot when trying to do too much at onceLoads data slowlyHaving to make bulk edits is hardSo now you should know if you need to use Power Editor or Ads Manager, a lot of people get these two confused. They do the exact same thing (create ads) but just in different ways. I do suggest using power editor to create ads then ads manager to optimize ads.Choosing your ad type:Click ads \u2014 this ad is for 1200x628 size images, there is plenty of space to visually show a CTA on one side of the image and a lifestyle or product on the other. This is one of the most common ad types.Carousel ads \u2014 these ads are a lot more creative, they are usually have the advantage of being able to relay more information to web users as these ads have multiple images, headlines and descriptions.Canvas ads \u2014 this is a relatively new one and helps you create a \u201cmicro landing page\u201d within the Facebook platform. This can be a great way to educate your leads before sending them to your actual website.Creating Your Contest Ad CampaignsWe\u2019re assuming that you took our advice and decided to make a contest for your lead capture campaign. GREAT! If you didn\u2019t and you decided to use a lead magnet, that\u2019s fine as well, but replace the words \u201cgiveaway\u201d or \u201ccontest\u201d with \u201clead magnet.\u201dOnward\u2026We are going to go over 2 campaigns that you need to set up when running your giveaway. The first is to capture the interest of people who will be most likely to enter your giveaway and the second is to re-engage those who have entered your giveaway or shown interest in it.1. The Contest PostWe need get our contest out there and seen by the world. So the best way to do that is to create a high quality ad that has a good Click Through Rate (CTR) and is optimized to the (lead) pixel we are going to place on the contest entered success page.Quick guide on how to set these pixels up in VYPER (note, you must have the PRO account for tracking pixels to be allowed).Create/login to your Facebook Ad accountAdd the Facebook pixels to your contest page. This can be done on the settings step when creating your giveaway. We are placing the \u201cPageView\u201d (all pages) and \u201cLead\u201d (thank you page) pixel. NOTE \u2014 if you are already using the pageview pixel simply rename the pixel. Change \u201cfbq(\u2018track\u2019, \u201cPageView\u201d); to fbq(\u2018track\u2019, \u201cContestPage\u201d);.Create your Ad. We are using the carousel ad to show off all the products that we are giving away. The CTR is usually better on these ads as you can provide more information before paying Facebook for the click through to your contest page. Meaning you can validate the user/click better.Create a list of your competitors. This will help target people who are already interested in what you sell (product or information). E.g. We ran a giveaway for HumbleBody.com (hemp based skincare products) so we collected a list of other organic skin care brands.Create your campaign, I use the following naming convention to keep my campaigns descriptive and organized \u2014 \u201cleads / contest / competitors\u201d. This helps define our campaign \u201cconversion goal / content type / targeting type\u201d and I also use the UTM builder and the camping name to see the traffic in Google Analytics. Below is an example of the link that I would use in my ads.Source = facebookMedium = cpcCampaign = leads / contest / competitorsCreate your ad sets, I usually break these out into the interest group or placement. For Humble Body we create 6 ad sets making the interest different in each ad set.Decl\u00e9orOlivellaJuaraTata Harper Skin Care\u2026\u2026.. and a few othersFor the bidding strategy set a lifetime budget and automatically optimized to your offsite conversion pixel (Lead). A lifetime budget is easier to manage and Facebook\u2019s optimization algorithms are not forced to spend your full daily budget which prevents you from wasting money! Once you have run a few campaigns you can then switch to daily budgets.Now you are ready to launch your ad campaign. Make sure your ads are set to run only while the giveaway is accepting entries so set the ad end date 1 day before your giveaway end date.2. The Contest Remarketing CampaignNow that you know that people want your product (they visited your contest page) you can set up some remarketing ads to engage these people again. Returning visitors are 7x times more likely to complete a conversion goal than a first time visitor.Quick guide on how to set these up:Create your custom audience from the PageView pixel we placed above. I usually break out my audiences into 10 or 15 day increments from when someone visited. So my audience naming convention would be \u2014 PageView (15), PageView (30) and PageView (180).Go to your audience page in Facebook manager and choose create audience. You can find this page from the mega dropdown, click on the \u201caudience\u201d menu item.Create a new audience using the website traffic tab. These are the best audiences to create as they automatically update as more people visit the page unlike uploaded lists that need to be constantly uploaded to stay relevant and up to date.Create a custom combination audience. Using custom combinations allows you to include and exclude certain traffic so this can be a very powerful tool.Choose the event for traffic conditions. We use the event instead of the URL as this is a more accurate method of collecting data on our website visitors.Select the pixel \u201cPageView\u201d if you want the audience to be even more targeted you can choose the \u201cLead\u201d pixel that we placed above, this smaller audience will serve ads to the people who have opted-into your giveaway.Create your campaign I use the name \u201cretargeting / contest visitors / female\u201d. I like to create a male and female campaign so I can optimize by gender. This means pausing ads and ad sets that are not performing well (CPA or CTR too high).Create your ad sets, I usually break these out into the time periods mentioned above so for example \u201c0\u201315 / contest visitor / mobile\u201d and \u201c0\u201315 / contest visitor / desktop\u201dCreate an ad that has a special value proposition for people who have already visited your contest or page. For example we offered a 10% discount for our remarketing campaign. E.g. Still looking for that perfect \u201cxxxx\u201d, come back and get 10% off your first order with the coupon code \u201cxxxx\u201d.Once you have created the Audiences and ads you are ready to go live and start making some money!So there you have it, the killer combination of Facebook ads and giveaways. This tactic works for bringing in new visitors to your website through the incentive of the giveaway as well as recapture those visitors with an incentivised remarketing ad.With this tactic you can collect emails and generate sales from new prospects.Tips for FacebookWhen creating your ads test 3\u20134 images and text variations to see which ad combinations get the best conversion and clickthrough rates. You can then pause the ads that are not performing well to save some cash.Aim to have an audiences that has at least 1000+ people in it as the minimum Facebook daily budget is $5/day. You want your audiences to be target but still have enough people in them so that your ads run at a reasonable frequency (e.g. we do not want 1 person to see our ad 10 times in a day).Optimize your ads to the Facebook pixels. Facebook do a pretty good job at automatically optimizing your ads for the best ROI. It is worth setting some benchmarks though as you can\u2019t simply do whatever Facebook says. See how much your are paying for the below are compare to industry benchmarks:Lead (aim for $1\u20134 for a basic email sign up)Click through (aim for a CTR above 0.5%)Cost per click (aim for a CPC under $3)Note that all of these metrics will depend on the type of industry and niche you are in.Pause ads that have no conversions (Leads) and a high spend. This is why we separate out the interest groups, gender and days since a visitor hit your website. You will probably find your product is best suited to a certain gender, interest and that the 0\u201315 day period since visiting your website perform better than others.BONUS \u2014 If you want to utilize your Facebook pixels for more than just your giveaway check out some of the options below how on to install the pixels across your entire website.Here is the Facebook guide to setting up pixels on your website, if this is a little too much we suggest using a plugin within your CMS.Essentially you need to place the \u201cPageView\u201d pixel in the header template of your website, you will need the Facebook Chrome browser extension to see if the pixel is firing correctly.Here are guides to adding pixels to the most popular CMS\u2019s:Wordpress (setup guide)ShopfyMagentoThe pixels I like to add to my website are:PageView (we can also create custom pixels for contest pages)Lead (used for giveaways, email capture tools etc.)AddToCart (used for abandoned cart)InitiateCheckout (used for abandon checkout)Purchase (make sure you have dynamic checkout values on this pixel)The first two were the pixels we used in our giveaway settings.If you have any questions about this strategy please leave a comment below are I will personally answer it for you!

But apart from the main objective, we had an alternative objective \u2014 to increase social interaction. This giveaway enabled us to target both the concerns in one go.About The BrandPhotoWhoa helps Photographers discover awesome, innovative, and informative photography products at discount prices. It brings the best industry products from world famous photographers and photography brands at a discounted price.Moreover, the Photowhoa blog helps budding photographers draw inspiration from expert photographers through interviews or one on one conversations.The PrizeDeciding on the price was majorly influenced by photography as that is target audience. We decided to offer three winners a set of our best products. The total value of the prize was more than $2000.With VYPER the entire process was very easy. There was a huge list of prizes that were being offered and to present it was a challenge but with VYPER\u2019s it was simple to present all the prizes in an enticing manner using their editor.The Promotional StrategyThe major promotions we did was through our social media channels and our already-existing email list as the target was referral participants. Also, we submitted the giveaway to few sweepstakes and giveaway sites as well.Sending the giveaway to our existing email list may sound counterintuitive, but we were sure that we\u2019d get a fair amount of referral traffic. We knew they would want to enter themselves and will post the contest on their own social media channels to get entries. They\u2019d also share the contest with their friends through email as they\u2019d want more referral points.Key TakeawayMake sure you include a lot of information in your giveaway landing page.Promote your giveaway to your own list first as these people probably know similar people who would be in your target audience.Aim for a high value prize pools, PhotoOriginally published at VYPER.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "6 Ways to Improve Your Website Popup Conversion Rate", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/6-ways-to-improve-your-website-popup-conversion-rate-efa47e3f104d?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2017-11-15", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-26", "readtime": "6.27", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "6 Ways to Improve Your Website Popup Conversion RateVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowNov 15, 2017 \u00b7 7 min readSummaryEasy, actionable steps to improve your website popup. More emails mean more traffic which means more sales!This short but detailed guide will require you to stop and think about your user for a second then really build and deliver something that will add value to them.Value, not annoyance is the key to a successful popup!Why You Need To Update Your Website PopupsA very common question that many website and business owners ask is \u201cHow to I grow my email list without spending money on advertising or annoying my visitors\u201d.The good news is, there are hundreds of ways to do this, but we are going to go over the most important one.Using website popups are one of the most common and effective ways to turn a website visitor into an email subscriber.Over the years, the results and methods of collecting emails has become harder and more advanced. Website users are becoming a lot more protective of their email address and to be honest they should be. There are more emails being sent than ever and the internet is full of spam!There are also now ad blockers, Google penalties and privacy concerns to overcome.At this point, you\u2019re probably thinking that using popups to collect emails sounds too hard, you can\u2019t beat Google!Don\u2019t Give Up, This Is Why You Still Need PopupsHaving worked with many clients to grow their business, time and time again we see that the more successful ones have good email lists.Email is the one audience you can OWN.It is by far one of the most effective ways to generate sales, traffic to your website and engagement. No matter how many people say email is dying we are yet to see another source be as consistent, personal or advanced as email.The conversion rate and profit per user is still higher than most other channels and there is no large controlling entities that are going to change the rules on you overnight.For example, YouTubers lost all their revenue overnight as Google changed the T&C\u2019s for displaying ads on videos or how Facebook or AdWords can shut down your account at any moment if you do something that is not to their liking.An email list you can take with you, you get plenty of warning if you are starting to annoy people and they are recoverable. A banned Facebook account is not.6 Ways To Improve Your Website PopupSo, let\u2019s get into the valuable stuff now that you know why building an email list is so important. You may already have a popup or form that is collecting you emails but I bet you still want more?Below is a list of small tweaks you can make to your website popups to improve their conversion rates.1. Frequency and cookie lengthMake sure that you are using a service that does not show your pop up again after the user has subscribed.Generally, you want to wait 24\u201348 hours before showing your pop up again to someone who did not opt-in. If someone has signed up, you never want to show them the same popup again as the popup has done its job.2. TimingYour popup needs to show at the right time to avoid annoying your visitors. When will this pop up be relevant to them, when is the right time to ask for their email?Immediately?After they read some content?After they view a product?When they\u2019re about to leave?You want to make sure you are adding value first then asking your visitor for something in return.Most of the time we suggest people set their popup when a user is intending to leave. This makes sure to show the popup to everyone but also only shows it once the visitor has finished doing what they came to do.Also, the exit intent popup can be a way to make visitors stay longer.E.g. If a pop up offered a discount on signup that user may sign up then go back to browsing your website to use the coupon. You have then re-engaged that browser instead of them leaving. Potentially even turned them into a customer.If you were to show that popup at the start of the browsing experience you would by saying you are already willing to discount your product before they have even looked at it.Other methods we would suggest are 80% of page scroll or around 10 seconds on site as a study by Quicksprout.com showed this to have the highest conversion rate.They also tested exit intent as a trigger and found that it increased conversions by 46%.In short, if you have the option to use \u201cexit intent\u201d as a popup trigger, USE it!3. DeviceYou need to show your popup on the correct device. Stop and go through your website on mobile and desktop as a first-time user.Go on, take a second to go and do that now.If the popup was annoying or hard to opt-into on mobile, consider removing your popup from visitors on mobile.A few common reasons to remove you popup from mobile are:website is slow to load on mobileyou have too much text on the popupyou have too many form fieldsyour popup conflicts with share button or website functionalityGoogle is going to start to penalize websites with popups on mobileThe signup process needs to take less than 10 seconds for a visitor to complete.4. User experienceImprove the experience of the popup, make it easy to signup or close. Limit the amount of required fields (name and email) and have a large close option or a \u201cno thanks\u201d option.A trick here is to have the \u201cno thanks\u201d option make them second guess not signing up. E.g. if we ran a coffee website my popup could say:Pop up pitch \u2014 6 barista approved coffee making tips for better brewing at home!CTA to signup \u2014 Send me the tipsCTA to close \u2014 No thanks, I like horrible coffee5. The OfferUsing \u201csignup for website updates\u201d is a terrible offer. Please don\u2019t use that!People may be interested in your brand and want updates but using this super boring offer is a sure way to decrease your conversion rate.People usually respond better to:IncentivizationGamificationYou need to either incentivize someone to take action or entertain them. So now you are wondering how the \u201cF\u201d do I do that with a pop up?See the gamified popup example we created below (VYPER shameless plug).Ways to incentivize someone to join your mailing listOffer knowledge (courses, ebook, case studies)Offer solutions (guides, free service or tool)Offer a way to save time (templates, lists)Offer a way to save money (coupons)Ways to gamifyThink outside the box, how can this experience be fun for the userSee the example above6. The Copy & VoiceThis aspect of your pop up is the one that varies the most from business to business. You need to ask yourself a few things about your website visitors.What are common phases they use (industry lingo)?What is the voice/tone (serious, funny, laid back)?How to include a call to action (sign up vs send me the tips)?How aggressive can you make the pitch (buy now vs learn more)?What are their pain points?What solutions are they looking for?Do they respond to saving time or money more?One of the best ways to really understand your customer is to build a persona of your ideal customer or website visitor.Do some research and find out what the best age, gender, income status etc is and then that will also help you answer the above questions.Once you understand your user it is much easier to write copy that will resonate with them.SummaryNow that you have all the knowledge to build an awesome popup.

Awesome that you could pencil out some time in the day from Grow & Convert, have been an avid reader for a while.Just wanted to go through a few questions with you today about content marketing.BENJI: Cool. Fire away.INTERVIEWER: So our first question is, tell us a little bit about your business, who are is your audiences and how you\u2019ve gone about leveraging content marketing for this?BENJI: It actually started while I was still working full time for another company. I was running marketing for a start up in San Francisco.I met my partner Devesh at a marketing dinner held in San Francisco run by Sujan Patel.I had just left Thinkapps, which was another startup that I\u2019d worked for in San Francisco. I\u2019d built out an entire content marketing program for them and grew it from zero to 35,000 unique visitors a month and it was driving almost all the revenue for the business.So it started with Devesh and I talking about this problem and then figuring out that there is a lot of marketing blogs out there but no one that\u2019s really teaching this with really in-depth case studies and learning material.So that was the angle that we wanted to focus on, really helping educate the market on content marketing.INTERVIEWER: So you\u2019re finding that there\u2019s a gap in quality content available to people for learning content marketing.Your website helps people ranging from solo entrepreneurs to large companies that need direction and education of how to turn content marketing into measurable results.BENJI: For sure. Yeah that\u2019s definitely simplified, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.INTERVIEWER: Well after reading your blog post, you guys are publishing some pretty awesome stuff.BENJI: Thanks. So basically we have Grow and Convert for education and then we came out with a SAAS product. Like I said one of the challenges for marketers inside of companies is scaling content.So it\u2019s usually hiring writers, a lot of people starting out they\u2019re doing all the writing for their companies or they\u2019re getting the founders to do a lot of writing and so once it goes past that level, like founders can\u2019t be writing all the content forever.It\u2019s good to get the content off the ground but then you need the process to scale.One of the things that I\u2019d noticed being a content marketing manager and managing content for a few different companies was actually getting\u2026you take all this time creating content and getting content and then when you actually have to go get it into Wordpress, it\u2019s a huge pain.A lot of people are using Google Docs for guest posts, to write their own content because not a lot of people like writing in the Wordpress interface, formatting it and pulling all the text and images and headings from Google Docs takes an hour or two for each post.So we created a SaaS app called Postable.io which basically takes a blog post from Google Docs and places it in Wordpress in 15 seconds fully formatted, so it saves hours of time from formatting blog posts each month.INTERVIEWER: Yeah that\u2019s a huge thing because I think Google Docs is so much easier for sharing, reviewing and all that sort of stuff.If you\u2019ve got a guest blogger, you don\u2019t necessarily want to make them an admin of your Wordpress\u2026BENJI: Exactly, so even the security thing too, it\u2019s like consistency, getting a bunch of people in your back end is something people are already somewhat uncomfortable with.Also the consistency if you have a specific tone or writing style or way that you format the blog post, getting a bunch of different contributors all using their own styles is difficult, and so having one person to manage the content and having this process only take 15 seconds to a minute depending on how many images you have.It just saves everyone a bunch of time.INTERVIEWER: Question number two would be \u2014 from your past experience what sort of lead generation and lead bait content have been the most successful with content upgrades?For example out of ebooks, downloads, guides and checklists. What have you found to be the most successful in generating leads?BENJI: So I\u2019ve tested all of them throughout the career so I can tell you for Grow and Convert we\u2019ve tested a lot of things from spreadsheets to calculators to PDFs of our posts.The most successful thing that we have is actually a spreadsheet for Medium.I wrote an article about how I leveraged Medium to drive 10,000 visitors in four days, and a big part of the process in the post was using Medium publications.So these Medium publications have their own audience and basically their own email newsletter list and so just like any blog, going after a blog with a large audience, going after a Medium publication with a large audience will help you get visibility.So what I did is I create a spreadsheet that took 2\u20133 hours that listed all the Medium publications by traffic and then write descriptions about the topics that each one covered.The benefit to the end user was if you\u2019re going to follow my process for getting attraction on Medium, this was a big piece of it was finding the right publication for your content and pitching it to them. This made it really simple for readers.I think we have something between 8\u201312% conversion rate from visitor to conversion for that content upgrade.INTERVIEWER: That\u2019s really good for a blog post.BENJI: Yeah, really really high compared to anything else. I think the average for our other stuff is somewhere 3\u20134%.So it\u2019s pretty much double if not triple, and it depends on the source too that the traffic comes from. When someone\u2019s finding it through SEO we\u2019re seeing double the conversion rate again.INTERVIEWER: Yeah, so it\u2019s definitely worth putting in the time to make a really valuable content upgrade as it will pay off for months if not years!BENJI: A hundred percent, and so I like to contrast that, we\u2019ve done things such as PDFs or just like really bite-sized take-aways from our posts.Some of it we\u2019ve gotten feedback that the content upgrade isn\u2019t that valuable so we\u2019ve gone and changed some of those things, that was really early when we just didn\u2019t put that much value and time into upgrades\u2026Now we\u2019ve really started to put as much time into content upgrade almost as we do the posts, like creating calculators, template models or added blog content.Basically anything on top of a strategy that we outline in our post that we think would be helpful for someone to actually implement for their company.INTERVIEWER: Yeah, we\u2019ve actually had a bit of success creating guides, checklists and things in Google Docs and using that link as the content upgrade so people can do what they want with it.Add it to their drive, download It etc. but it also gives us the flexibility to change it at any point if we need to. So that also helps.BENJI: I think it\u2019s all a function of time.I think there\u2019s a lot of ways that you can add value and build your list using content upgrade.So again, I think it all comes down to how much time you spend on it. I think if you do put in the extra effort the content upgrade that do the best are the things that other people aren\u2019t creating like ling form ebooks.A lot of people aren\u2019t creating ebooks; calculators or models, so it\u2019s unique and we found that a lot of our people are downloading those as they have so much value.INTERVIEWER: And is that sort of like a development resource that you need to build out those calculators?BENJI: No, it\u2019s actually in Excel using formulas. So some of the stuff we do use freelancers like we\u2019ve gotten on Upwork, but most of it we can do all of it our self if it\u2019s simple spreadsheet or anything like that.INTERVIEWER: What\u2019s a blog post that you\u2019ve written, just as a reference, for a really good content upgrade?One includes a calculator and one that includes your top converting content upgrade? Just people can go and look it up.BENJI: Yes, so it\u2019s going viral, I got 10,000 views of Medium in four days, so that was the one I was referencing the blog post.In terms of the calculator, we just recently did a post on lead nurturing versus direct conversions to help people figure out is it better to offer a content upgrade, or is it better to actually go for a direct lead.Some businesses it \u2018s better to grow an email list and others it\u2019s better to go directly to a sales call, let\u2019s say if you\u2019re an agency or something like that, it might not make sense for you to build your list.It might make sense for you to go directly to a sales conversation even though the numbers are lower, and so this calculator helps you decide, based on your traffic metrics and your conversion metrics, which is better for your business.We have also done a post on a growth model for your blog and that also has a calculator content upgrade.(Editor\u2019s note: We created our own tool that makes content upgrades super easy! Try it today!)INTERVIEWER: I was reading through your website and one of the blog posts that was very interesting is that you\u2019ve used surveys to drive leads.Obviously this is more of a nurture approach as opposed to direct response.What\u2019s the strategy you\u2019ve used to integrate surveys and what sort of tools do you use to implement that strategy?BENJI: Yes, so there\u2019s two ways that we\u2019ve been using surveys.This actually stems from my background, start-up marketing, I mean for growth marketing, like early stage startups this is a big key.It\u2019s just really understanding your users in-depth, so we\u2019ve been using it in two ways.One \u2014 to help us figure out what type of content is most valuable to our customers;Two \u2014 when we launched Postable surveying our users to figure out what features are valuable, what part of the product do they think is most valuable, help us improve and iterate on our product.I guess because this is more focused on content I can walk through some ways that we\u2019re using surveying.So in our welcome email we ask the question:\u201cWhat\u2019s the biggest challenge you\u2019re currently facing in marketing?\u201dAnd we ask them to tell us a little bit about themselves, the reason we\u2019re doing that is to really target marketers inside of companies, and so part of that relates to our content strategy.We want to attract the people that we think are going to purchase from us down the road, and so by asking who these people are we\u2019re able to kind of measure over time how many of these people we\u2019re actually attracting that fit within the bucket that we\u2019re trying to go after.And too asking them their biggest challenge, we\u2019re getting a lot of data from our audience about what some of the most challenging things for them are.So these inform blog post ideas which then again go attract more people like these people back to our blog.So that\u2019s probably the biggest survey benefits, it\u2019s like a simple thing that we\u2019re doing, it\u2019s not anything complicated.It\u2019s just when someone subscribes we ask them this simple question. And it\u2019s something that not a lot of people do on their blog and it feels very personal.We also identify compliments from people and we can actually respond to every single person trying to give them some advice or just pointing them in the right direction with a piece of content we\u2019ve already written.So it\u2019s just going a little above and beyond and forming that relationship with our customers early on.We\u2019ve found it actually helps us in our sales process too just because we\u2019ve already had conversations with hundreds and hundreds of people. So yeah, that\u2019s a big surveying thing that we do.In terms of launching products, we launch a mini course to kind of validate the concept before actually creating a larger course.So a big aha moment for us was we through this user-research, because I come from the start-up world is very\u2026I guess \u2018abnormal\u2019 for people that are marketers to implement before they ever do the content strategy.Through surveying we realized that this was a common misstep. And this is like the most important step that anyone needs to have to be able to create a content strategy that can actually scale a blog.So even from when we\u2019re creating our product the surveying really helped us uncover some of those key pains that people were facing, and if we\u2019d launched our product without that section.I don\u2019t think people would have actually been as successful coming out of the program if we didn\u2019t survey them, we would have completely missed that step and told people to go directly to content strategy without knowing their customers.Some tools that we use, Survey Monkey, just keep it simple, it\u2019s free and you can create a free 10-question survey.So we actually showed people our process for sending out the survey to people, what the results were and then how to transform the results into actionable ideas for a business whether it\u2019s content strategy or blog posts.INTERVIEWER: So do funnel people on the click to subscribe and then send them to a survey? Say I\u2019m a user, I click to subscribe, fill out your survey, do you then segment lists based on those results or what do you segment?BENJI: So that\u2019s one of the questions I always get. The first few questions in the survey is just, who are you?We wanted to segment users versus core audience, marketers inside of companies versus solo entrepreneurs.There are some people that are outside the marketing industry, and in order not to taint the data and to paint the picture in a different way we try and funnel those out in the first questions so that we could segment our core audience.We wanted to know what those people really cared about versus people who are on our blog who are still engaged but maybe weren\u2019t in our core target audience.INTERVIEWER: Okay. So from that Survey Monkey form, does that import into your ESP (email service provider) or are you manually doing that?BENJI: Yeah we\u2019re manually doing that, we export to Excel.It doesn\u2019t go directly into our email service provider; we weren\u2019t using it to try to get a persona of people as we do not want to tie revenue or anything like that to the person.It\u2019s just for us to get a better understanding overall of who is reading our blog and what they\u2019re there for and what their challenges are. So we do not segment our email drips at the moment.INTERVIEWER: Yeah it\u2019s a huge step that a lot of people miss I think just because it does seem daunting trying to set that up. Once you just get your hands dirty it\u2019s probably worth it in the long run as you\u2019re showing us.BENJI: Yep.INTERVIEWER: The next question. You obviously rely a lot of SEO coming in the content marketing space, what other traffic sources do you see high conversion rates from? Now obviously quality of traffic is very important.BENJI: Yes. So we sort of uncovered a few things that we weren\u2019t aware of. One piece of our promotion strategy is a community content promotion strategy.The meaning behind the community content promotion is someone\u2019s already done a lot of the work to develop an audience similar to yours.For us there are tons of other marketing blogs and groups that contain marketers. Especially when you\u2019re starting off it\u2019s very difficult for you to go build your own massive community around a subject so just use someone else\u2019s.Someone\u2019s likely already done the work for you, and so the constant promotion strategy that we follow is doing the research around what other groups already exist.Or what other websites already exist out there that have the same audience, and then thinking through how we can go form a relationships with those people.Write about those companies so that they will want to share it with their audience or become active in these groups.Some of the high traffic drivers for us have been being involved with the GrowthHackers community, getting in the Inbound.org forum, writing guest blog posts.That actually all stemmed from a presentation that I saw about Keaton Shaw two years ago in San Francisco.He was the one that opened my eyes to the whole surveying process and how to do it and then through testing it on different startups, I honed in on a specific way to do it.A big piece of content marketing success came when I saw his presentation and mentioned him in my case study, I reached out to Keaton and said \u201cHey I wrote this blog post about surveying and a lot of it came from your presentation.He actually shared that in his newsletter which blew up to like 4,000 plus people, and then that really expanded our audience marketers in the start-up community in the VC world and founders etc.Again there are tons of marketing Facebook groups out there, but there\u2019s also the strategy of just finding people that have a similar audience and forming some sort of relationship with them.That\u2019s a big driver of traffic, it\u2019s actually ahead of SEO for us.And then the other one is providing quotes or contributing to content like this, so getting guest blog posts that are driving traffic from similar sites to sites in our same space back to our site, so getting links which also helps with SEO as well.INTERVIEWER: So that\u2019s like connecting and partnering with influencers in your industry.BENJI: Correct. Yes.So, just a lot of marketing blogs will contribute a portion of the post with a link back to our site and so it helps position us as an authority in the space.It helps drive traffic, so people found us through a lot of other marketing blogs out there.This was something that got revealed using our survey that we weren\u2019t super aware of, just how much this was actually helping our growth.Even the relationships, the people who are communicating back and forth with us, a lot of those people had come from other sites.INTERVIEWER: Okay so it comes back to the quality again, you\u2019ve got more validation than just your own from other blogs which makes content a lot more compelling and authoritative.INTERVIEWER: What\u2019s the typical launch strategy after you finished creating your blog post?BENJI: So I would say I don\u2019t use any tools, I think the myth that most people think is there\u2019s all these tools that can help you do this.I think a lot of the strategy comes down to what I was talking about earlier, the community content-promotion standpoint.So a primary promotion channel are these general marketing groups, there\u2019s groups that almost all of our posts will fit that we can share. there\u2019s a list of influencers that all of our posts would be a good fit for them to share.So there\u2019s this general concept of marketing overall which is primary, and then secondary is specific to one of the posts that we wrote.So for example I wrote a post about why marketing has become the hardest position to hire for.Again it fits in that primary bucket of it\u2019s a post about marketing but then the secondary category is actually hiring, and so if you think about the audience it\u2019s a little bit different. So you have general marketers who are interested this post, but then the secondary channel is recruiters, and so how does this even help us get in front of the audience that we\u2019re going after because maybe that there\u2019s marketing recruiters who now see this post and it helps them make the point to their client that marketing is actually hard to hire for so hire us; some recruiters might be interested in this post.So when it comes down to promoting it I\u2019m thinking okay let\u2019s find a bunch of recruiting groups or hiring groups.So it\u2019s thinking about each specific post in this really specific framing, and so we do this with every post.It\u2019s like the general go-to places but then there\u2019s also different influencers, different groups.Maybe some different people that would find this interesting and so there\u2019s this research process that we do for every single one of these posts like who are the influencers that are talking about hiring for marketing?What are the groups around hiring or recruiting or sites that talk about this and pitching our posts to them.There is a whole separate checklist that we do for every single post which is posting the key areas and then go find these other areas that are specific to the post and go after those, and use some of the same strategies but it expands our reach a lot and it brings a lot of other people who maybe typically wouldn\u2019t have come to our blog to read our content, to our blog and it expands our reach a lot.INTERVIEWER: How much time did it take you to build up that authority in those groups?Obviously you can\u2019t just go in and start posting your links saying \u201cRead my blog post.\u201dWhat sort of time frames do you think is adequate enough before you can start doing more salesy posts (your own posts)?BENJI: Yeah, it really depends on the group.I think you bring up a good point, I think a lot of people just say go join a group and go drop a link in there.It\u2019s not going to be easy for you because people are going to flag you and they\u2019re going to get upset, they\u2019re going to say like you\u2019re just here to promote your own content.There\u2019s a lot of time involved, it\u2019s really like being a genuine active member in the community, helping people when they have questions and then also sharing your own content when you think it\u2019s valuable.When you\u2019re posting two or three or four times a month every single week, it\u2019s too much for these groups.You also can\u2019t post in all the same groups, you have to time it, so like maybe one post a month and maybe you contribute in some other way in some other way in the meantime and you go find other groups or other promotion channels, and then maybe you come back to the same post two months down the line and re-promote it.I don\u2019t think content promotion is ever dead, I think a lot of people put the focus on the first week or two and then kind of forget about it, but it\u2019s like an ongoing cycle where it\u2019s like you have to keep re-promoting these things and figuring out new channels, and so that will continue to drive growth overall.But I think, going back to your original question, I think the key thing is being real and I think being genuine contributors in this community is really what\u2019s going to help you be successful using the strategy.INTERVIEWER: Yeah for sure.And do you see more success using that groups approach or when you\u2019re promoting your new post on all of your internal channels like Facebook, Twitter, infographics with Pinterest or anything?Do you see more traffic from your current following or from those groups?BENJI: I think it changes as a business just like when you\u2019re first starting a blog.Social channels, referral channels are probably going to be your biggest source of traffic.Over time SEO starts taking over more and more, and the longer you\u2019re around probably the more SEO contributes to your blog traffic. I think it\u2019s the same here.So the goal is in the beginning to use some of these different promotion strategies to continue to build your own email list and to build your brand recognition and to build your following.We first started out and no one knew who Grow and Convert was, now the biggest organic traffic driver is branded search keywords which helps us a lot because it means that people are starting to recognize the brand.They\u2019re not only searching for long tailed keywords that are bringing them to a specific post, they\u2019re starting to recognize the brand overall.So I think the goal is to use some of these promotion channels early on, continue to build your brand and hopefully over time you\u2019ll have enough of an audience, enough of an email list where your internal channels will drive a lot more traffic.Than you can spend your time just creating better and better content and continuing to grow your internal list.But yeah, it\u2019s kind of a chicken-and-egg thing, you have to do this first.INTERVIEWER: Yeah, it\u2019s kind of a combination of everything, you can\u2019t just do one channel.BENJI: Exactly.Download the cheat sheet and key takeaways from the Q&A session HEREOriginally published at VYPER.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Vyper Coding Language to Take On Solidity \u2014 More Secure Smart Contracts?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington/vyper-coding-language-to-take-on-solidity-more-secure-smart-contracts-ffd6b6bd1905?source=search_post", "author_name": "John Saddington", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@saddington", "publish_date": "2018-07-11", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-16", "readtime": "0.29", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Vyper Coding Language to Take On Solidity \u2014 More Secure Smart Contracts?John SaddingtonFollowJul 11, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readVyper is going to disrupt Solidity\u2026 or, will it?Originally published at DECENTRALIZED TV.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Vyper", "Blockchain", "Solidity", "Cryptocurrency", "Altcoins"]}, {"title": "Case Study: Motobilt Added 4,290 Emails in 15 Days", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/case-study-motobilt-added-4-290-emails-in-15-days-7ce94f544064?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2016-09-15", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-02", "readtime": "1.43", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Case Study: Motobilt Added 4,290 Emails in 15 DaysVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowSep 15, 2016 \u00b7 2 min readMotobilt is a company that sells custom fabrication parts, tools, builder parts, for off-road vehicles, hot rods, rat rods, and more.

I\u2019m going to guess and say growth is in the top 3!If not, well done, you\u2019re doing better than 99% of businesses wishing they had more/faster growth.This post is a list of the most creative marketing ideas we\u2019ve seen customers of VYPER implement and get amazing results from. Whether it be growing their email list, video engagement, social channels. app store rankings or hacking their Facebook ad engagement. This stuff is gold!Idea 1 \u2014 User Generated Content Through InstagramEveryone can see a stock or brand photo/image from a mile away! You\u2019re not fooling anyone. A little growth hack around this is using user-generated content in your emails, ads and on your website.The trick is getting this user-generated content without spending a ton of money or hours asking for it, following up and dealing with Dropbox links.The easy way to automate this and get a ton of user-generated content!Step 1 \u2014 Create an evergreen contest that is part of your purchase email drip (triggers after someone purchases from you). Make sure the customer gets this email containing your contest after they have received their product.Step 2 \u2014 Choose a prize e.g. $500 gift card, 50% off your next order or a free/complimentary product.Step 3 \u2014 Create a contest that requires people to upload a photo to Instagram, the photo has guidelines like (it has to be you using the product). If you do not want people to upload it to Instagram you can also choose the direct upload bonus entry, the Instagram entry just gets you a little bonus social impressions!(Selection of bonus entries for your contest. Choose \u201cpost a photo to IG\u201d or \u201cUpload an Image\u201d)Step 4 \u2014 Watch those entries roll in! Here\u2019s an example of the contest if you want to take a look.Idea 2 \u2014 Hack the Facebook Relevancy Ad ScoreFacebook\u2019s all the rage, but unfortunately, like all good things, the effectiveness is decreasing every year.Organic reach is dropping, engagement is dropping and CPA\u2019s (cost per acquisition) are increasing!What do you do when things like this happen? Innovate and find ways to \u201cgame\u201d the system, that\u2019s exactly what this marketing tactic is about.So what do you do!Step 1 \u2014 Create a contest with the bonus entry of liking, commenting and sharing a Facebook post you create. Make sure this post that you create is adding value and has a soft sales pitch in it, like an educational video with a discount and link to the purchase page in the text area (we will want to turn this into an ad later).Here\u2019s and Example contest.Make sure to ask people to do all three actions. You can ask them from 1 bonus entry or make a separate bouns entry for each engagement type.Step 2 \u2014 Run and promote the contest. Add it to your website, email your list, run some ads etc. Over the duration of this contest, you will start to collect hundreds of social engagements.Step 3 \u2014 When you have enough social engagement, a good number is 100+ likes, comments, and shares, turn that post into an ad.Step 4 \u2014 Scale this Facebook post to the audiences you want to target and benefit from the higher CTR\u2019s, engagement rates and relevancy scores. By using this method you can show social proof and build engagement for free.By having more social proof, your ad becomes \u201cscroll stopping\u201d, people are much more likely to stop and notice your post if it has hundreds of likes compared to a brand new ad with nothing.Idea 3 \u2014 Cheat YouTube EngagementYouTube is one of the most under-utilized platforms there is. A lot of people don\u2019t realize this but it\u2019s actually the 2nd biggest search engine. Yes, Google owns everything!It\u2019s a fantastic place to upload all your video content; branding videos, tutorials, how to videos, testimonials, product launches, webinar replays and more. You should be uploading and organizing all the content you can on this channel.One of the best ways to prove authority is to have videos with lots of views, thumbs up and comments. Organically this is not easy, you have to get lucky, work really hard at engaging viewers or wait a super long time before you get anything impressive.The hack for this is to incentivize these actions using your contest. Not only are you collecting leads but why not put those leads to work.Step 1 \u2014 Set up your contest, set a reward, pick a contest type (flash contest or an evergreen contest which is when you pick 1 winner a month or week). Example.Step 2 \u2014 Add your bonus entries for YouTube, you can also do this for Vimeo or other video content directories!Step 3 \u2014 Add that contest to your checkout page, email drips, social channels or website.Idea 4 \u2014 Evergreen ContestThis is one of the easiest ways to keep your social accounts growing and your existing customers, followers and leads feeling special.See an example evergreen contest that we actually use and is live \u2014 HEREThis is the example banner we also use in our emails and on social to get people to enter our evergreen contest. Make your images stand out, explain what the prize is and if you can, the value of it to them!A few reasons why you would want to use this marketing strategy.It\u2019s a great addition to your email drips for leads and customers. Keeps them excited to open your emails.It keeps your social channels growing (followers, shares etc).You have a constant stream of new leads into your funnel and they are referring others just like themselves.You can get people to constantly be sharing your content (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, any channel).You can change up the bonus actions every month depending on what your monthly goals are (One month we wanted to incentivize signups to our webinar, the next we wanted to grow our YouTube video views).This also gives you a great landing page to promote when you sponsor events, speak at events, guest appearances on podcasts, run joint promotions & email blasts as well as provide influencers with something to promote that people can actually benefit from instead of just asking for a sale.The beautiful thing is that when you send people to this evergreen contest, it looks like you\u2019re doing them a favor by offering something for free. But you are actually collecting their email as well as incentivizing them to complete a whole list of actions.Just look at all the things we made you do in our monthly contest above.Here\u2019s the email we added to an email drip to re-engage people who have created a VYPER account but not activated a paid plan. We know they are interested so maybe a free product will incentivize them to come back to our website.It also squeezes a bit of value out of them if they go and complete all the bonus actions of following us on social, sharing our content and leaving us a review.More ways to promote the evergreen contest:Add it to more email drips (leads, free trials, customers etc)Add to your website & blog/postsUse as a content upgrade on your blogShare on podcasts or at events etc.Add to your payment confirmation page or emailsAdd to your lead form or popup confirmation pageShare with affiliates & influencers as marketing materialPut it in your email signatureAdd to all your social profiles (also make a post and pin it to the top of your page/feed)Having this asset in your marketing toolkit gives you an asset that provides value and is easily shared and managed. Once you create the contest, just draw a winner and move the end date one month back on the last day of every month.Idea 5 \u2014 Get to the Top of the Podcast ChartsPodcasting is now a great awareness and authority building channel. Not only do you produce a TON of content but it\u2019s now very doable with the advancements in recording and self-publishing.You can create an educational or interview style podcasts to build an audience of listeners to then one day sell to (I know that sounds bad but that\u2019s the point of the podcast. Give value, get sales in return).I\u2019ve personally been on a few podcasts now (open guest requests hint hint) but the one thing that always comes up is how to market your podcast and get more reviews to increase your ranking in the iTunes store (the most common one, there are others like Twitch etc).A great way to do this is\u2026. You guessed it, incentivize it.This works really well for the launch of a podcast, two podcasts that I guest spoke on LaunchPeer and The Social Media Growth Show used a contest to grow their listeners/subscribers and game the podcast charts early on to appear in the top podcasts for business.The way they did this was using a launch contest.You can see the contest was giving away a prize that would attract the right people (marketers and business owners). These were the people that LaunchPeer wanted to listen to their Podcast.This contest generated 13 five star reviews (probably more by now as I wrote this while the contest was running), a bunch of social shares and YouTube subscribers within the first few days of launch getting it ranked high in the iTunes podcast charts.Below are a few of the bonus entries that this company used to get people engaged with their new podcast. The goal is to get your new podcast in as many social feeds as possible and collect as many subscribers and reviews within the first week as possible.The early signs of traction are rewarded with higher placement in the iTunes store and even the possibility of being featured at the top of your category, remember to choose a sub-category to increase your chances.For example, instead of choosing Business, choose Business -> eCommerce as your primary category.Here\u2019s also a great post on how to get to the top of the iTunes podcast charts.In summary, it all comes down to sending engaged traffic that\u2019s subscribing, reviewing and downloading your podcast. All of that is possible through your launch contest ;)Idea 6 \u2014 Incentivize App DownloadsWhat determines the success of an app? Downloads, daily and monthly active users usually. Revenue comes into play once you have these things in place (there\u2019re always exceptions but this is a general growth cycle for a mobile app.)For the revenue to happen you need the downloads, this is the first step and the direct response conversion goal to optimize to.Paying for downloads and installs can get expansive $3\u201315 CPA\u2019s are common depending on your industry, For example, an install on a free game is going to have a way cheaper CPA than a paid finance app.A little hack we have seen VYPER customers using to cut their CPA\u2019s is including the app download from iOS and Play Store in their contest.We recently added a templated bonus entry for this due to demand for app contests. Not only that but you can also use the entries to incentivize other actions to improve your app marketing efforts. Example.Leave a star ratingLeave a comment reviewShare the app launch on TwitterShare your app download page on FacebookThe list goes on as these are customizable actions you can create.What Next? It\u2019s your turn!This week, go and implement at least one of these marketing strategies. You do not have to use VYPER, you can manually recreate these same viral campaigns (it\u2019s just a little harder, we make your life easier at VYPER \ud83d\ude01)I\u2019m sure your head is filled with ideas at this point and hopefully, some of these hacks will give you some actionable tasks to better market your product, app or service.If you have any questions or hacks to add, leave them in the comments below!", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Compelling + Relevant = Good Giveaways", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/compelling-relevant-good-giveaways-2e85e9cb81b2?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2016-07-19", "last_modified_date": "2017-04-23", "readtime": "1.48", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Compelling + Relevant = Good GiveawaysVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowJul 19, 2016 \u00b7 2 min readQuick post today.So I happened to listen to two really good interviews today, and I was pleasantly surprised that both interviewees talked about viral giveaways as part of their promotional strategy.The first one was an interview with Josh Payne on Mixergy. In the interview he spoke about how StackSocial used giveaways to build a $10m+ empire without touching any outside funding (they raised $800,000 but never used any of it).I got one really great line from this interview. Payne said for giveaways to work, you should offer something that\u2019s compelling + relevant. That\u2019s a really good way to put it. One of the biggest issues I see from giveaways that don\u2019t succeed is that they don\u2019t fit with one or the other \u2014 even worse if they don\u2019t meet both.But finding that balance that can be tough. Giving away something that\u2019s not super relevant will hurt the quality of your leads. Giving away something that\u2019s really compelling might end up being too expensive. The tough part to giveaways is finding that balance. We wrote a series of blog posts that attack this topic (check out the blog posts re: the funnels).He also mentioned that he gives away free products. That\u2019s another feature built into the pro version of VYPER called \u201copt-in bribes\u201d \u2014 we give you the ability to give away free stuff to people who won\u2019t even win.The second interview was with The Drip Club founders on the Growth Everywhere podcast, where they talked about giving away 6-figures worth of retail value through giveaways and how much it helped build up their brand.The big takeaway from this interview was that you can giveaway 6-figures of stuff without actually having to pay for any of it. This is done by building up your brand. Once you have a big brand, companies are willing to give you free stuff.If you\u2019re looking to start your next giveaway, why not try VYPER?Originally published at VYPER.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Case Study: How Biostrap 4x\u2019d Their Popup Conversion Rate & Collected 25k Emails in 2 Months", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/case-study-how-biostrap-4xd-their-popup-conversion-rate-collected-25k-emails-in-2-months-4cfea868656e?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2018-01-22", "last_modified_date": "2018-01-22", "readtime": "3.72", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Case Study: How Biostrap 4x\u2019d Their Popup Conversion Rate & Collected 25k Emails in 2 MonthsVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowJan 22, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readSummary \u2014 Biostrap recently switched over to the Interactive Popups tool and had some pretty awesome results to share. So we compiled a quick Q&A session to see what really moved the needle.30% of this website\u2019s revenue comes from email so you can imagine how even a small % increase email opt-in conversion rate could snowball into huge profits.1. Why did you add a popup to your website?Across all our user acquisition channels, we were sending lots of top of funnel traffic during the busiest shopping months of November and December.We added a popup to capture emails on our landing pages to make the most of this traffic. Email is one of the most import acquisition channels for us as we sell a higher priced item so conversion on the first touch point is lower than cheaper eCommerce sites.It usually takes a number of brand interactions to get the conversion. By using email we can reach these people for very little cost instead of paying for ads.2. What is your website/product about?Biostrap is the most advanced wearable platform. Our clinical-grade pulse oximetry allows deep biometric insights and full-body machine-learning algorithms are able to detect and analyze any repetitive activity that wearers perform. Visit website.3. How important are emails to your business? What do you use them for?Email capture is an integral part of our user acquisition strategy. We send out emails for sales, blog and product updates.This channel has a lot of benefits when it comes to building a relationship with your leads. Not only is acquiring the email important but the follow-up email drips and broadcasts have a huge impact on sales as well.The more emails we acquire the more we can scale our business.4. What percentage of your rev/sales comes from sending emails?About 30% of our sales come directly from emails. So optimizing our website for email collection is important and directly related to our revenue.5. What information are you collecting?Just email. We wanted to limit the information collected to enable higher conversions and reduced friction in user experience.FREE Tutorials: Access our eCom Facebook Ad Growth Hack Video Library [Here]6. What are you offering your visitors in exchange for their email?We set up the popup in such a way that everyone wins a prize. We have 8 offers on the interactive popup ranging from $10 off to free products.It is important to incentivize and offer something to your visitors as you are asking them for a favor when you show an opt-in form. The market is becoming more competitive so brands need to offer something more engaging than their competitors.7. Have you tested multiple offers before? If so, what did you test and which offer had the best conversion rate?We haven\u2019t done much testing with multiple offers. But we had an average conversion rate 8% after the switch, which we are very pleased with!We were able to 4x our conversion rate using gamification and incentivization in out popups!8. What service were you using prior to VYPER? What results were you getting?We\u2019ve augmented our current services with VYPER\u2019s offering. We are using Sumo for several popups, but we have VYPER\u2019s Interactive Popup as our default and prominent email capture on our main landing pages.We were getting a 1\u20132% popup conversion rate prior to VYPER.9. After swapping to VYPER, what was the change?After switching to VYPER for our primary means of email acquisition, we were able to 4x our popup conversion rate!We were able to capture around 25,000 emails in the span of less than 2 months.So you can see how improving your website popup can have a huge impact on the overall business and revenue.Biostrap was able to take their conversion rate from 1.5% to 8% by changing over to Interactive Popups.If they had stayed with their old popup they would have only collected 6,250 emails instead of 25,000. This can make a huge difference in your bottom line if you are monetizing your email list.Not to mention all the added sales that were driven by people winning coupon codes.You do not have to be using VYPER to achieve these benefits and results (although it definitely helps), here are some easy popup optimization adjustments you can make to your website!Let us know if you have any questions in the comments!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Conversion Rate", "Email Marketing", "Popups"]}, {"title": "Holiday Marketing Mistakes That Could Ruin Your Q4 Sales", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/holiday-marketing-mistakes-that-could-ruin-your-q4-sales-7092f408e7b3?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2018-09-26", "last_modified_date": "2018-09-26", "readtime": "7.09", "claps": 8, "voters": 1, "content": "Holiday Marketing Mistakes That Could Ruin Your Q4 SalesVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowSep 26, 2018 \u00b7 8 min readYou might think it\u2019s too early to start planning your winter (BFCM) holiday campaigns just yet.However, the large retail industry leaders are already busting out their Christmas collections, and customers are getting used to having several months to plan and do their holiday shopping. The time might just be right to start contemplating your own content marketing campaigns for the festive season.The cost to advertise over November and December increased by 2\u20133x so be prepared and avoid some of these common holiday marketing mistakes.Customers are likely to spend a staggering 80+ billion dollars in the US alone come the holidays, and most online stores see a spike in traffic as soon as the weather turns chilly (United States).And while there are certain industries that are certainly better suited to holiday campaigns (take the example of John Lewis), that\u2019s not saying you can\u2019t do something special this season and spread some holiday cheer.However, while getting into the festive mood can do you no actual harm, there are certain things you should avoid \u2014 so as not to find yourself standing alone under a mistletoe with no customers in sight.Here\u2019s our list of Christmas holiday marketing mistakes \u2014 dos and don\u2019ts!SourceDon\u2019t sell: giveDespite the above-listed enormous earning potential, and even though many a shopper will naturally associate the word \u201cChristmas\u201d with the word \u201cdiscount\u201d, the holiday season is not a time for hardball pitches and forced sales.It is the season of giving, after all, so your focus should shift to providing useful and shareable freebies, rather than coming up with the best way to outmaneuver your competition in terms of discount percentages.Freebies are a great lead generation tool even in the dead of summer, and they can go a lot further in terms of brand awareness and customer satisfaction during the end of the year frenzy.Come up with a lead or link generating a piece of content (either a video, an e-book, perhaps a case study or even an infographic) that you will specifically promote during the run-up to Christmas.It does not necessarily have to be Christmas themed itself (after all, evergreen content tends to provide a higher ROI than seasonal content), but packaging it up as a seasonal gift can go a long way in terms of promoting it.Don\u2019t be a Grinch: publish and leverage holiday contentEven if you are not a huge fan of the holidays, or if you are not planning to publish any Christmas-themed content, don\u2019t be the one who refuses to engage in the festivities. No one likes a Grinch, and dampening others\u2019 spirits is not the best way to win people over.The holiday season is an incredible time to take advantage of user-generated content, which will all likely be seasonally themed.Start up a bit of a competition on your social media requesting the best pictures of gingerbread cookies or Christmas decorations (or anything else that is both festive and in line with your brand and product) and share and promote the best ones.Reward a particularly inventive creation with yet another freebie (in the form of a discount or actual product) without announcing you will do so. Your followers will appreciate the thoughtfulness.Bear in mind that these types of promotions can get hectic and very competitive. Be prepared to set out clear rules and even face some backlash even if you have not done anything \u201cwrong\u201d.Don\u2019t recycle: be originalSome companies do Christmas exceptionally well. And even if your particular industry does not lend itself to over the top holiday campaigns, and you are sorely tempted to take a leaf out of someone else\u2019s book and recreate their ten-year-old campaign: don\u2019t.Customers tend to remember beloved holiday campaigns, and you shouldn\u2019t be surprised when they call you out for being a copycat. You can\u2019t reinvent Santa or the reindeer anyway.All you need to do is find a unique angle that represents your brand\u2019s identity and sprinkle some glitter over it.Focus on the main elements of the Christmas season: spreading joy, giving, selflessness. Or even on some other running themes, like snow, nutmeg, gingerbread or even Christmas lights.You don\u2019t have to invent a brand new content marketing campaign that will only run for a month or two. Try to figure out how you can add these elements into the campaigns you are already running to give them a unique twist.Don\u2019t assume it\u2019s business as usualWhile the holidays are undoubtedly a season of joy, they are also a season of mounting frustration. Don\u2019t expect your customers to behave as they do on any other day of the week.First of all, take into account the heightened stress levels, the shortened timespans they have to get things done, the fact that they are literally swimming in advertising every single day, and you will understand why they might be a little less patient and forgiving than usual.Do all that you can to provide a port in the storm: make your content lightweight and lighthearted, focus on the positive, and don\u2019t lose your own temper.The content you provide at this time of year can more specifically focus on the pain point solving variety. You\u2019ll notice the subtle difference it makes in your engagement rates.Also, make sure that your customer service and communication teams are ready to go: no matter how you are promoting your content, you will be chatting to all sorts of seasonally stressed individuals. And if your campaigns run well, you can expect a surge in inquiries and purchases.Don\u2019t forget to be prepared for them in every department.Don\u2019t pass up corny copywriting opportunities: leverage the spirit of the seasonAdding holiday buzzwords to your blog titles and email subject lines is not going to cut it. If you are not going to put a red cap on and get into the festive mood, don\u2019t falsely represent your content as being holiday themed.If you are going to mention the holidays in your titles, do make sure the actual content is to some extent similarly themed as well.A lot of campaigns package ordinary subjects (like the five best ways to drive more leads through guest posting) into something with a Christmas flare (like the five lessons we can learn from Santa Clause to improve our outreach campaigns).You can easily borrow motifs and themes from holiday books, movies or even carols, and apply them to your regular content producing subjects.If it feels too forced, or if you are simply not the kind of company that would produce such content, don\u2019t try to emulate a false holiday cheer. You will come off as phoney, and that will not fly well with your readers.Don\u2019t forget the Christmas cardsFailing to send out Christmas cards would be a huge mistake. All your leads and customers would surely appreciate a nice card celebrating the season.Don\u2019t turn it into a discount code or sales pitch either, which is what most companies tend to do. By all means, offer a discount code or do a seasonal sale, but don\u2019t put it in the Christmas card.Just stick to the good wishes, and return to marketing when the holidays are over. That way, you will be perceived as less of a corporation and more of a human entity.Mailchimp recently opened up the feature to start sending direct physical mail via a postcard, CRAZY I know!Don\u2019t wait until the last minuteWhichever route you choose: going all in and producing a holiday advent content calendar, with a new piece of Christmas-related content for every single day of the month, or laying low and nodding on while the festive season is over, you need to prepare on time.If you are going to do something seasonal, make sure you start early. While late summer might not seem the right time to get into a holiday mood, the end of October would be just the right time to start brainstorming ideas and toying with different concepts.If you wait until December, everyone else\u2019s campaigns will already have started, and you will be forced to play catchup.Set out a time when you will start working on the holiday content in advance, and see how your ideas evolve over time.That way, you will both be able to track what your competition is doing (or not doing) and come up with your own take on this Christmas season.Good Luck!Even if you are not the biggest fan of the holidays, joining in on all the festive fun is the surest way to reach new leads and customers, and engage with the following you already have.Be a little bit less serious, and try to forget about conversion statistics and all those other metrics you keep focusing on throughout the year.If the main goal of your Christmas campaign is to sell, and that remains your only focus, you will be losing out on a lot.There\u2019s a reason why storytelling is huge in marketing: consumers like to connect with a brand before they purchase from it, and Christmas time is the perfect time to establish and strengthen this relationship.Feature post author: Anita Sambol is a content strategist and graphic designer at Point Visible digital marketing agency.

This is a feature that can make or break the success of a campaign. Essentially this feature gives you the opportunity to reward your contest entrants for doing ANYTHING! Below is a list of the best custom entries to use in your contest! We have examples from some huge brands that used this feature to get some huge results that outperformed any campaign they had done before!So we know that custom entries are important. They allow you to set a question/task for your entrants. This is super handy as you can use this system to game \u201corganic\u201d actions.A few of our favorite custom entries are below and will help you grow your business in all areas, not just your email list!1 \u2014 Comment, like and share our Facebook postThis is a fantastic way to increase the validation of your social posts. All you are doing is rewarding a few entries into your contest for doing so instead of having to pay Facebook for an engagement campaign.PRO TIP \u2014 chose a post that you are running ads to. This will increase the engagement on your paid post and get you a better relevancy score as well as improve your CPM which should lead to lower conversion rates and higher click-through rates.Here are some Facebook ad results from a recent client that used this technique. This is prospecting traffic as well (does not include remarketing, past purchase or any of that other stuff that the Guru\u2019s try and trick you with)!2 \u2014 Read a blog post and leave a commentThis was used by Foundr Magazine to drive engagement and readers to their blog. They chose a popular post and got people to read the post, comment and share it. It is now the most commented on a blog post with some of the highest shares and traffic numbers.For the question, ask them what their main takeaway was from the blog post. Or you can ask them, \u201cwhat was the blog post about\u201d.PRO TIP \u2014 By asking for feedback on the post you can also relay this to the content team to see what people thought about the post. Incorporate that feedback into your next blog post.Read bout Foundr\u2019s contest with VYPER here.3 \u2014 Join our Facebook groupThis was used by Scotts Cheap Flights to grow his Facebook group to huge numbers. All you are doing is sending people to your Facebook group to join then asking them a question such as, what is your Facebook username?This is great because a group has a much better reach than a Facebook page. So any future posts in your group will reach more people.PRO TIP \u2014 this can be used to grow any community, a slack channel, subreddit etc.4 \u2014 Subscribe to Facebook Messenger UpdatesHow do you get your customers to notice you and listen to what you have to say? Connect with them on multiple channels and make sure your message gets through.This custom entry is perfect for building a second \u201cemail\u201d alternative. The open rates are over 80% and CTR\u2019s can be above $20\u201330%, when was the last time you saw that in an email?So the idea here is to use a service such as ManyChat or ChatFuel to manager the messages etc. You will want to create a signup page with the service (takes 15seconds) then take that link and use it in the customs entry of your contest!PRO TIP \u2014 have an automated messenger sequence setup so that when someone signs up they receive Facebook messages about your brand\u2019s offers, products, promotions, news, interest facts, industry secrets, niche benchmarks.Always remember to add value, the world is not about you, it is about the customer so make them feel like it!If you can\u2019t prove value, at least entertain them with funny gifs and cute dog photos!5 \u2014 Show us some love on Product HuntThis contest custom entry can be used for any platform where you are submitting your product or service. A few of the big ones are Product Hunt, BetaList, The Awesomer, Cool Material, Incredible Things and good old Reddit.Ideally, this custom entry allows you to incentivize people to upvote or like your listing which increases your ranking in these communities.PRO TIP \u2014 use a contest in conjunction with the new launch of your product or service. It is a great way to build traffic, awareness as well as grow your email list and social accounts.We have also had a few customers using this method to build exposure and market their initial coin offering (ICO) which has been interesting and one of the top ones resulting in over 85k entrants.FREE Checklist: 17 Unique Ways To Promote Your Next Contest [Here]5 \u2014 Complete this quick surveyOne thing that companies do not do enough is listen or even ask customers what they want. Peoples time is valuable so in a lot of cases, you need to incentivize them to share their opinion a contest custom entry is perfect for this (you do not have to give discounts or cash to get feedback).PRO TIP \u2014 Share that feedback with developers, content creators and onboarding product team. This will help them understand the5 \u2014 Sign up for our eventThis one is a little more specific for local business so the contest promotion channels need to be relevant.Essentially this custom entry will incentivize people to at least look at your event and consider it. Just create the question and drop the link to your Eventbrite or Facebook event and get people to register.PRO TIP \u2014 offer some sort of bonuses if they actually attend, this will make sure that people do not just signup and not attend. A few users of VYPER have run a contest and then said they will announce the winner at the event.6 \u2014 Sign up for our webinar/web summitThis one is a little more scalable than a physical event and we had the company \u201cLaunch Summit\u201d execute on this custom entry perfectly. They created a contest and had the custom entry to signup to their Launch Web Summit.Signing up was free and they made money on upselling VIP tickets (getting access to speakers and replays).This was the event they were promoting \u2014 take a look at the Eventbrite listing.Here is another article how this company also used VYPER to generate $55k to fund their web summit.PRO TIP \u2014 make sure you mention the speakers, value of the summit and more in the contest description to build the desire for somone to attend. By using a Leaderboard contest, this user was also giving away VIP tickets to whoever collected the most entries from sharing the summit!PROEST TIP \u2014 Another growth hack for this custom entry was to use it to build hype around Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals. This build up awareness around the deals so that when the hour struck 00:01 am you had an army of people waiting to buy. Example Here7 \u2014 Re-gram our Instagram photo, then tag @company-nameThis works well for ecom physical products, the most famous example is the \u201cred bathing suit\u201d company.

Enter viral competitions.Contest \u2014 https://vyper.io/c/914Below is a short Q&A session we had with the founder Eric about his experience using VYPER to run a viral contest! Pew Pew Tactical is a firearm learning resource blog that focuses on the complete newbie to create a friendly learning environment.Why did PewPewTactical.com decide to run a contest?We decided to run a contest mainly because we were seeing competitors running them to great success. Doing some research and asking fellow entrepreneurs led me to try out VYPER as our platform due to their social sharing tools.We are also in a niche that is restricted on paid channels such as Facebook and Google ad networks. This was another organic lead generation option.What other marketing campaigns have you tried but didn\u2019t work?The best comparison would be against our content upgrade run through Sumo popups for a shooting target PDF in return for an email address. It performed OK at .91% signup percentage.How did your contest perform in terms of your other marketing campaigns?With a much better offer in the content (ability to win a cool rifle handguard and two other prizes), our email signup jumped to 4.92%\u2026a 441% increase.Results from campaign2,229 new emails171% increase in Facebook reactions7.2% increase in website traffic during contentsWhat are the top 5 things you learned from running a contest?Having a 2nd & 3rd place prize helped increase signupsGiving additional entries per referral seemed to help (we did 3x)Image is really important\u2026TEST!Send to your list multiple times.Ok to have a longer time duration (we did 2 weeks but could have done up to 4).What would you do next time you ran a contest?Create/use higher quality header and share images.Higher budget for prizes.Integrate a digital bribe along with entries.Post in Reddit, related forums, etc.Get influencers and companies involved to share.How did you promote your contest and what worked the best for you?FB sharing and hitting our own email list did the best. But that might be since our other social avenues are a little underdeveloped.I\u2019m definitely looking forward to going much bigger with the next giveaway\u2026 bigger prizes and reaching out to our influencer network. Now that I know it works and VYPER does the job well\u2026 I\u2019m ready to ask for influencer help.What is the value of an email lead to you and how are you going to monetize these new leads?The value of a lead is around $6 (contest generated $13k+ in rev value) and we\u2019re looking to monetize by adding them to our newsletter where we send informative articles with affiliate links and also to our online store with apparel and accessories.About The CompanyWebsite \u2014 https://www.pewpewtactical.comContest \u2014 https://vyper.io/c/914Pew Pew Tactical started off as a personal blog but soon grew into one of the top firearm learning resources. We focus on the complete newbie with no politics, a friendly gun-buddy tone, and tons of corny/nerdy references.What marketing challenges do you face at the moment?

But why use interactive content in the first place? What\u2019s so great about it?As it turns out, interactive content is the future of marketing. And I\u2019m not talking about just contests \u2014 I\u2019m talking about everything. Marketing itself is becoming more and more interactive every day. Contests are a piece of the puzzle, and it\u2019s time to look at the big picture.This Is Your Brain on InteractionFor decades, marketing has created passive users. How many times have you seen the same ad over and over again? Maybe there\u2019s something unique about it, but ultimately it\u2019s just an ad. You\u2019re passive while watching it. You don\u2019t get to experience the brand.That\u2019s been changing recently thanks to interactive content. Interactive content is any kind of content that allows the user to directly participate. Contests, quizzes, games, and surveys are just a few examples.Interactive content is getting so big because marketers are figuring out that users want to experience a brand first-hand. When marketing collides with the real world, users get a completely new experience.A great example is how Reebok advertised their new shoes in Stockholm. A speed cam was mounted on a small outdoor kiosk. Anyone who ran faster than 17kph won a free pair of shoes. This was no ordinary ad; this was an experience that transformed ordinary passersby into runners.Those people who interacted with the ad came away with a one-of-a-kind memory. The interaction led to something bigger (the ability to break away from the day and have fun), and that left a lasting impression.Interaction is a way of transforming your users. The reason that people love grandiose stories is because most people live rather plain lives. Many are unsatisfied with their life. Stories give them a way to escape, and directly participating in a story is even more cathartic. Compare this to passively viewing an ad, which seems pathetically weak compared to the interaction.Marketing needs disruption. It needs a future that\u2019s free of clickbait ads and spammy email marketing. We\u2019re living in an age of value, and we need to be giving our users the best experience ever. Interaction is a great way of doing that.Creating InteractionInteraction comes in all shapes and sizes, but it\u2019s not a one size fits all scenario. Different forms of interaction will work with different brands. For example, it would be comical if a law firm started using Snapchat. It\u2019s key to identify the types of interactive content that work well with your brand.Interaction is created whenever your user has the opportunity to participate in your brand. This includes social networks, comment sections, and interactive media (contests, quizzes, etc.). This isn\u2019t an all-inclusive list, however, as there are constantly new ways to interact with users. But for this article, we\u2019ll focus on these three areas.Interaction on social networksSocial networks are probably what you think of when you hear \u201cinteraction\u201d and \u201cusers.\u201d Many people have several social network accounts, which also means that they have more opportunities to participate.But this is where most brands go wrong. They think that the inherent capabilities of social networks (liking, commenting, sharing) are interactive enough. And they\u2019re dead wrong. The abilities to like, comment, and share are great, but to truly stand out, you need to use these as a means to an end, not the end itself.For instance, if someone is scrolling through their Twitter feed and sees a Promoted Tweet, they might feel a bit jaded about it, especially if it\u2019s a thinly veiled sales tactic like a coupon code with a description that resembles a meme.But imagine if someone\u2019s scrolling through Twitter and sees what looks like the first sentence of a book. It\u2019s a Promoted Tweet, all right, but it\u2019s strange. If they click more, they discover a micro-story about your brand. It might not translate into a sale, but it has a much better chance than a traditional ad.This is just one example \u2014 social networks are ideal places to experiment with interactive content. Take advantage of their social capabilities, and use them to create standout interactionInteraction in comment sectionsThis seems pretty straightforward, but so many brands do it wrong. How many times have you seen comment sections with no participation from the brand? Generally, brands only respond when people complain.But when brands devote time to responding to users\u2019 comments, both good and bad, it creates an interesting dialogue. Most people still see brands as faceless entities, so by responding, you\u2019re giving your brand a friendly face. You\u2019re bridging the gap between brand and consumer, and that\u2019s something the consumer will always appreciate.Or you can think outside the box. We\u2019ll use the example of creating a short story on Twitter. What if you created a short story in comment sections? Readers could follow your latest post to get updates on the story. Obviously this isn\u2019t for every brand, but it\u2019s an interesting thought experiment that should get you thinking about what you can do with \u201cordinary\u201d tools.Interactive mediaHere\u2019s where it gets really interesting. Interactive media like contests and quizzes are fully user-based. The user gets to choose their own adventure, so to speak, and participate in the brand. This is a new phenomenon, but the rising popularity of interactive media shows that it really works, and it\u2019s powerful.Interactive media can also create new leads from thin air. It sounds magical, but it\u2019s 100% true. Say someone stumbles upon your site and finds a fun quiz. They take it and then get an offer to sign up for more content like that. If they enjoyed the quiz, they\u2019ll likely sign up.And contests are perfect for lead generation because everyone wants to win, and they want to be notified if they win. It\u2019s almost unfair how powerful these techniques are.Of course, you have to consistently produce amazing content. If someone signs up for a contest and gets only boring sales emails from you, they\u2019re going to unsubscribe. But if you keep producing interesting, relevant content (both interactive and traditional), you\u2019ll have a much better retention rate.Giving up the powerIf you remember one thing from this article, let it be this. When you\u2019re creating interactive experiences (or doing any sort of marketing, for that matter), give the power over to the user. Don\u2019t try to sell to people \u2014 give them an adventure that happens within the world of your brand.Those people who interacted with the Reebok ad didn\u2019t feel like they were being sold to. They felt like they were taking part in something fun. That should be your goal with interactive content. Give up the power, and you might be surprised at the results.Ian Chandler is a narrative marketer and writer based in Ohio. He helps businesses leverage the power of story at Narrative Marketers.

A large part of this was crafting an email that explained to influencers that they could leverage their audience to easily climb the giveaway leaderboard and even win the grand prize. This removed the need to provide payment for posting as the trip to Hawaii was enough incentive.Email marketing funnel: automated and one-off emails to keep contestants engaged.Gamifying the contest using an audience segmentation funnel.Promoting the contest using Gromo\u2019s proprietary paid media strategy.What Didn\u2019t workUsing cold prospecting Facebook Ads, you need to segmented targeting with audiences, interests and engagement type.Working with micro influencers on Instagram that don\u2019t have swipe-up capability.

One of the main ones being the Snapchat duplicate \u201cInstagram Stories\u201d which has surpassed Snap usage.This feature within Instagram has allowed brands to deliver more interesting and up to date content.Like all \u201corganic\u201d social media, there are some catches. Your content does not get seen by everyone and you need to follow the below guidelines to maximize the effectiveness of this channel.On a daily basis, more than 300 million users can be found on Instagram\u2019s Stories feature, which begs the question, if your business isn\u2019t using it, why not? According to the Instagram blog, users spend on average at least 24 minutes a day on the site.Need more convincing? How about this little factoid from Instagram? One out of five stories gets a direct message.That\u2019s a pretty solid reason to consider upping your Instagram game by using this feature.In this post, we\u2019re going to look at how you can use Stories to effectively boost interaction and sales.This infographic goes into more detail about how some of the world\u2019s leading brands have put this feature to use.Source Katka PavlickovaWhat Is the Instagram Stories Feature?It\u2019s pretty simple. You post a short video to your feed. The video can be about whatever you like \u2014 you can even shoot it directly off your phone, straight from the Instagram app. You\u2019ve got fifteen seconds, so make it count.All you need to do is to tap the camera icon while the app is open and then choose the type of content.You can choose between:Live: This allows you to post as you\u2019re filming. People can comment while you\u2019re busy broadcasting, and you\u2019ll have the option to post it to Stories when you\u2019re done. This is a good option if you know what you\u2019re going to say and that you can control the environment you\u2019re shooting in.Normal: Here you\u2019ll choose \u2014 one tap and you take a photo, holding it down will allow you to film a video.Boomerang: Not sure what to film but have a good GIF to share? Boomerang mode creates GIFs that loop for up to three seconds.Superzoom: This feature is a lens that keeps zooming closer to the subject. It\u2019s good for a big reveal. Have fun with this by adding an awesome soundtrack as well.Rewind: This is more of a fun lens as the video gets filmed in reverse, but it can also make for a change if you\u2019ve been posting the same thing over and over again.Stop Motion: This is great for a bunch of product shots. Stop Motion creates a video out of still shots. So instead of people having to click through to the next photo, this lens creates a slideshow, as it were.Hands Free: Not everyone wants to shoot immediately when they pick up the phone. Maybe you want to position it differently, or focus on another area. Just make sure that you have something you can rest your phone on so the picture will remain in focus and the phone won\u2019t shake. When you\u2019re ready to shoot, say, \u201cAction.\u201dAnd\u2026 We are sure that Instagram will be adding more options as well.Then just shoot your video and post. You\u2019ll have the opportunity to add a description, location, stickers, etc., before the post goes live.That\u2019s all there is to it. The post will stay live on the site for 24 hours and then happily move off into internet oblivion never to be seen again. Which is a big advantage when you want to build a loyal following, or when you want to test out new ideas.What About Hashtags?You should be using hashtags \u2014 sparingly. Make sure they\u2019re as relevant as possible to your content and limit the number of hashtags you use. How many is best?Here\u2019s a quick clue: the answer is not as many as possible. You can add up to thirty in total, but according to Statista, between two and five is the magic number.They got this figure from a study based on 200,000 Facebook posts, which while not the same channel, still provides a good indication of what to expect from Insta.Think of it this way, every extra hashtag you add decreases the likelihood of engagement from users interacting with the post.Stickers Aren\u2019t for Business, Surely?Oh, but they are. Stickers are a fun way to help your video stand out from the rest. Even if it\u2019s something as simple as a smile sticker, it adds an extra element of fun to your video.This channel is not all about serious business posts, so take advantage of that.There are tons to choose from \u2014 you can add a special holiday sticker, or even just a day of the week sticker. Have fun with this one, and your followers will as well.Set the LocationYou can use a sticker that shows your location. This is useful because people looking for Stories relating to the particular area will be able to see a group of posts about the location.Your post could be among them, and it\u2019s a great way to drive local traffic to your door.Want Quick Engagement?Why not set up a poll? This is an excellent way to get your followers involved and to discover if people really are interacting with your content.Use the Poll sticker and choose your questions carefully. Ideally, you want answers to be outside the standard yes or no response.Allow the Sharing of StoriesThis one may seem self-evident, but if you want better engagement than just people liking your posts, you\u2019ll need to go to your Story Settings and enable sharing.That way, people can send your story via direct message.You\u2019ll get extra views without even trying.Consider Adding Some WritingThis can be easily done to add some text to the video. All you need to do is to hit the Pen icon on the screen once you\u2019ve finished filming.This could be a great way to add content to your website, like a list of ingredients, etc.Find a Related Instagram AccountWhy not share the love with another Instagrammer? Tagging them before posting means that they get a shout out, and hopefully, they\u2019ll return the favor at a later stage.This is also a simple way to make sure that someone you want to shout out to knows you\u2019ve done it. They\u2019ll get a notification on their feed.Check on Who Has Watched Your StoryIf you click on the \u201cYour Story\u201d button on the home screen, all you have to do is to swipe up to see who has viewed the content.It\u2019s a good idea to do this from time to time, and to check out those accounts as well, so that you can keep track of who your main audience is.Keep an eye out for repeat visitors as this can be a good way to tell that you\u2019re posting content that people like. After all, if they didn\u2019t like it, they would hardly keep coming back, would they?This is also a way to keep track of which Stories worked out to be the most popular.Take the Time to Center Stickers and TextThe center of your screen is prime real estate, so put the most important information there. If you don\u2019t center your text, you run the risk of some of it being cut off when people are scrolling through.Don\u2019t forget that Insta adds information to the bottom of the screen, like your account name and when the story was posted. Don\u2019t let that drown out the info.Add a SoundtrackSource Namroud GorguisYes, most people will watch your story without the sound on. But there are going to be those who don\u2019t mute it.Consider adding music to help reinforce the images on the screen and set the mood.I Don\u2019t Want All That Effort to Go to WasteGot a video that you\u2019re really happy with? One you\u2019ve spent some time producing that you don\u2019t want to head off into the sunset after twenty-four hours? Then click on your story, and then the \u201cHighlight\u201d button.You\u2019ll have to rename the file, but once you\u2019ve done this, it will feature on your business\u2019s profile page.Aim to Be on the Explore PageIf you can get your post onto the \u201cExplore\u201d page, you can boost views significantly. The way to do this is by assigning the right hashtags and encouraging engagement.This is not the same as the Popular page on the site. Each person\u2019s Explore page is populated with content based on what they have liked and commented on before.Want Some Simple Ideas to Get Started?Of course, most readers at this point will have decided that the Stories feature is a good bet for businesses. But getting started is another story. How do you decide what to post?In the next section of this post, we\u2019ll go through some easy ideas for creating content effortlessly.Just remember that the videos have to be short.There are programs that you can use to create a series of short vids, but the best tactic is to stick with short and sweet videos that get to the point.Tutorials: Obviously, you are not going to be able to show someone how to create a masterpiece painting in the allotted time, but you can show them simple things. And if the tutorials feature your products, you score bonus points.A Behind the Scenes Look: This might seem like a bit of a corny thing to share, but a lot of people are interested in what goes on behind the scenes, or they want meet the support staff. It\u2019s a way of letting potential clients see the care that goes into making a product and helps them connect with the brand at a deeper level.Use It to Break News: Okay, so you\u2019re not going to want to post information about how Larry in accounting\u2019s bunion is doing, but if you have some interesting news to share, this is a great place to do it. Has there been a major breakthrough in your industry? Are you getting in a new product line? Talk about it.Make a Listicle: When all else fails, create a list of the top ten anything. Ideally you should stick to things that are related to your business in some way. So a travel agent could, for example, choose the Top Ten Bucket List Destinations. The idea is to create a short list with great visuals and information that is easy to scan.Our Top Hints to Keep in MindSource Fynn schmidtTell a StoryThe picture above is infinitely more interesting than the standard ones that we see of the Giza plateau because there\u2019s some life in it.You can almost imagine the cart driver calling out or see yourself climbing on a camel.The best Stories are actually stories. Make sure that your videos have a logical sequence to them.Be RealYou want to present great content, but you want it to be real.

The more people you have sharing and engaging the more Facebook will show the post.Watch this video a second time if you get lost but the outlined steps are below to follow as well.

These followers should be willing to spread the word about you, whilst gaining some form of value for themselves in the process of doing so.Here are a few of the best blockchain marketing steps to get started in growing your own community:1. Understand your product and find your brandBefore anything else, make sure you understand your own product and value proposition better than anyone else.This may seem superfluous, but it\u2019s critical for you to dive deep into your business\u2019s own fundamentals.What are your (assumed) value propositions, and have you validated these?Have you found your product/market fit?Does your product need blockchain or its own cryptocurrency?If so, are you planning to use a security token, utility token, or otherwise?Although it\u2019s difficult to understand these things early on in your company\u2019s journey, having these fundamentals in place will help you define your brand before you put lots of effort into marketing your blockchain project.This means that once you do start building your community, you\u2019ll have a head start and a competitive advantage because you won\u2019t be needing to change your product\u2019s messaging somewhere along the way.At this stage, focus on your story and narrative from the customer\u2019s point of view.Slapping the words \u2018decentralised\u2019 and \u2018blockchain\u2019 onto every part of your product messaging doesn\u2019t work like it may have used to.Focus on the solutions that your product provides to your users: how does it make aspects of their lives easier, or how does it save them money?2. Find a way to connect with your ideal community membersWho could benefit from your product the most, or who would it interest the most from an investment point of view?Take the necessary time to do research on this, and remember that the blockchain communities congregate in different and new channels all over the world and the web.Initially, you\u2019d like to check out existing communities, perhaps even for competing products, and build up some relationship with them.Blockchain enthusiasts specifically hang out on community platforms like Reddit, Telegram, Discord, and Slack.Start conversations!This phase shouldn\u2019t be about marketing your product or your brand to large audiences, it should be about having real, honest conversations with people that might be interested in what you have to offer.Find out exactly how your product or service could be beneficial to them.Humility is key throughout this process.Chances are that the people you\u2019re talking to have been in the space for longer than you have and that they\u2019re discerning and critical of \u201cjust another blockchain marketing message\u201d.FREE Guide: Start leveraging Facebook Groups for super targeted traffic! [Download Here]3. Make community buy-in worthwhileThis is really about giving back to your community: providing them with a real and tangible value which they can benefit from, without necessarily asking for anything in return.For example, provide them with useful content. There will hopefully be something about your product or service that\u2019s tied to knowledge only you possess.Share that knowledge.Educate your community with insightful content related to how your product works or how you envision the blockchain space to develop, also, what\u2019s in it for them? Make sure that you provide value when you ask someone to commit 20 minutes to read your content.Again, keep this within the confines of your expertise, at least in the beginning.There are enough people out there with general, sweeping statements about blockchain and cryptocurrencies.Keep your insights specific to the things in which you\u2019re an expert, and grow from there. Credibility is key when it comes to marketing your blockchain project.Apart from providing your community with content, you could allow them to participate in contests, or you could provide them with early access to certain components of your product.Be creative, and always ask for feedback. Keep finding new ways to provide value and keep your community engaged.4. Find out what your community likesWhen following the above three steps, you\u2019ll hopefully find the right balance between taking your time to build valuable relationships and moving at a fast speed in order to quickly get your product to market.At the same time, you would hopefully have learned about the types of values and rewards that your community benefits from.If your product has a utility token, does it benefit your users to reward them early with the tokens that they\u2019ll be using on your platform?Perhaps an airdrop might be a good choice for you?Perhaps the contest you ran via your social channels showed significant traction?Whatever it is that showed the most results, make sure to hone in on it when scaling up your marketing efforts and building out your campaigns. These are the key selling points to get people to back your blockchain project.Try and avoid the shiny object syndrome. What works once will more than likely work again.5. Amplify reach through a viral contestOnce you\u2019ve established your initial community and figured out what type of value they\u2019re interested in, you\u2019ll need to engage and scale this community.This is where we found VYPER to be a very useful tool in our blockchain marketing campaign.We used it to facilitate viral contests (also known as an airdrop, bounty or token offering etc), which are able to vastly amplify the reach of your audience size and engagement.In practical terms, this consists of rewarding people for taking part in certain actions, such as sharing certain posts on social media or creating custom content around your product/brand through channels such as Youtube and Medium.Case Study: Vyper to boost viralityAt Spike, we have successfully used VYPER to make certain blockchain campaigns go viral. Here\u2019s an example and a few steps on how we did it.Getting a person to promote and share your project is a pretty big ask.Essentially, what you\u2019re asking is for the person to put his reputation on the line for you.This is why, normally, it is a bad idea to ask for referrals straight in the awareness phase of your marketing campaign.On average, a B2C customer needs a minimum of 8 interactions before he/she is convinced to buy from you.It wouldn\u2019t make sense to start with such a big request after the second customer interaction right?This is why a fully mapped out pirate funnel is important to follow throughout your blockchain marketing campaign.The Pirate Funnel is a useful customer-lifecycle framework invented by Dave McClure. It is used to map out and optimize your marketing funnel.Essentially, for every product that you\u2019re trying to sell, the objective is to funnel them through a similar journey.If you\u2019re not familiar with it, the funnel looks as follows:Awareness \u2192 Acquisition \u2192 Activation \u2192 Retention \u2192 Referral \u2192 Revenue.The order is flexible and can be rearranged, depending on the nature of your product or service.The pirate funnel serves as a solid framework and is the ideal basis for creating a flowchart for your specific business.Example:Step 2: Determine the objectives and key results (OKRs)Setting objectives for the team is an effective way of later measuring the outcomes and results of your campaign.In the case of a viral campaign, your OKRs can be (for example):Objective 1: To build a large and highly engaged communityKey Result: 20,000 Telegram members in the community before start date of pre-saleKey Result: 40.000 participants in referral/bounty programKey result: 10,000 Twitter followers + 10,000 Facebook likes + 5,000 Youtube subscribersKey result: Project x appeared in at least 10 tech or crypto publications before start of crowdsaleKey result: Project x has been reviewed by or ran an AMA with at least 5 influencers before start crowdsale.The main question then becomes:Based on the above defined OKRs, how can we leverage VYPER to get to these key results?Through VYPER, you can reward your community with points for certain social actions.Based on the above set OKRs, there are at least three key results we can achieve by using VYPER.Step 3: Set up a rewards programThis is going to be one of the most important parts of your blockchain marketing campaign.We\u2019re going to reward the community for joining our Telegram group, liking our Facebook page, following us on Twitter and subscribing to your YouTube channel.You need to choose bonus actions that are relevant to your project. Some examples we used below. Each bonus action is rewarded with points (+8).But how are you going to get 20k people to join your Telegram group when you currently have an email list of just over 1k people?This is when the referral marketing feature comes into play.Step 4: Implement a referral programThe best part about VYPER is that, instead of just rewarding your community for single actions, you can also reward them for referring their friends & colleagues.You can do this using their landing page builder, embed it on your own landing page or add the widget to your site.This means that if your community likes your product and brand, and the reward structure (or perceived reward structure) of a campaign is spot on, you\u2019ll get your community promoting your blockchain project for you.A referral = when someone who enters your contest shares their referral link with friends or co-workers and they sign up.A reward = collect 100 points by referring others and completing bonus actions to get X number of tokens.How to make a project go viral?At this point, we\u2019re using artificial virality to grow our product reach. With virality, you look at the Viral Coefficient and try to optimize that.The viral coefficient is simply \u201dthe number of new users an existing user generates\u201d.The difference between organic and artificial virality is that artificial virality incentivizes the sharing through a tool (VYPER), whereas organic virality is when your product\u2019s success is based on the network effect.This means that your product has been built for users to organically share it with their peers (think Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter).More information can be found in this article about the viral coefficient.The difference between the rewards mentioned earlier on and the referral is that the social actions are limited.Users can only like your Facebook page or follow your Twitter account once, while they can invite an unlimited amount of friends to your contest.This key difference is important to understand.While people are more likely to follow you on Twitter than referring your project to their friends (remember, they risk their reputation to refer friends to your project), they are also wired to win a game or contest.When entering a leaderboard contest, for example, participants might not be planning on referring their friends straight away.They first start with following you on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, but soon find out there is no other way to go up the leaderboard than by referring their friends.After having done these multiple micro conversions (actions that lead users to your target conversion) and seeing their place on the leaderboard, they are more likely to promote your project through referrals.Next to that, by rewarding the referral action with, for example, 5x the points of normal social actions, you further stimulate virality.So at this point, you will likely have your community competing against each other for our prizes.If your campaign setup is spot on, and you have a positive and high enough viral coefficient, you will go viral in a natural way.For example, when you start with 100 participants and they all invite 12 friends per week on average, of which 4 eventually sign up (viral coefficient of 4), that will result in 25.600 participants by the end of the month.(conversion rate % is so high as we used an embed contest option which does not count the page views, only the conversion within VYPER.You can choose to run a contest on a VYPER landing page, your own or a website widget.).Here are some more tips for marketing your blockchain project:Make sure your prizes provide a high-enough incentive and resonate with your audience.We generally always opt for a leaderboard contest as opposed to a non-leaderboard structure, as this incentivizes continuous sharing by participants to obtain the first place and win the main prize.Think, what would your ideal customer/audience do anything to get? What has a high enough value for them to share your project?Create engaging content urging viewers to participate or share.Make sure that the content you create looks nice, and that it facilitates easy sharing.Design a good looking contest, share images and make sure the social pages you\u2019re trying to build look good and have some engagement and recent posts.Leverage urgency and social proofAlways toggle on the use of social proof and urgency. For example, add a time limit to your campaign to ensure that participants join sooner rather than later.Have the social proof feature enabled to show potential signups that people are entering.Think of relevant entriesWhat content do you want to get shared? What are the most relevant channels that you want to grow? This could mean more reward weighting for Youtube video productions rather than Medium articles, for example.Amplify awareness through adsPromote the contest yourself. Let the world know that you\u2019re going viral. If executed correctly, you\u2019ll witness a snowball effect.Leverage your contest to build social proof on your ads to improve your CPA, CPC\u2019s and CPM\u2019s. Here\u2019s a guide on how to do that.To sum it all up:Growing your community starts with trust.With a strong idea and vision in place, and by finding the right balance between passion and humility, you\u2019ll be able to excite potential new users and investors.When you offer your community real value and adopt a \u201cgiving back\u201d attitude, community growth comes naturally.About Spike:Authors: Pascal van Steen, Gino Taselaar & Erich Rickens, Spike | Blockchain marketing agencySpike is a growth marketing agency driven to facilitate the widespread adoption of emerging technologies, most notably within the domains of Blockchain, Fintech, and Proptech startups.By constantly applying data-driven and agile workflows, we\u2019re able to swiftly implement growth strategies, focusing on quick wins in the short term, whilst upholding the outcome of long-term growth and user adoption, depending on the nature of your product.

You had a better chance of becoming a movie star or an astronaut. (Fun fact, in my research I found out that it\u2019s easier to become a movie star than to become an astronaut!)Yet the entire country was ready to win, despite how improbable it was (yes, even I spent $5 on lottery tickets).That\u2019s the power of contests.Humans are emotional creatures. Even in the face of great odds, we will try to achieve the unachievable. We will dream the unbelievable.The thought when someone sees a contest isn\u2019t \u201cOh, I\u2019ll never be able to win\u201d it\u2019s \u201cOh, why not. Anyone could get lucky.\u201d  When you combine contests with email lead generation, you create an amazing machine that could help you gain hundreds if not thousands of email addresses. Add in the viral sharing component via VYPER, and now you\u2019ve got a recipe to really add more emails to your list.Viral email contests do this:Offer an irresistible \u201cbribe\u201d to join your mailing list.Helps you collect real emails (and usually their best one) because people want to get notified if they\u2019ve won.Get your loyal customer base sharing your brand with others so they can get more entries into the contest.Builds incredible buzz and brand awareness through social sharing.In fact, Noah Kagan, founder of AppSumo & SumoMe used contests to add 200,000 emails to his email list.Screenshot from Noah\u2019s AppSumoBryan Harris used giveaways to get 2,239 email subscribers in 10 days.Screenshot from VideoFruitJosh Earl used contests to add 187,991 emails in 11 days.Screenshot from SPI, post by Josh EarlAnd there are tons more examples out there of people successfully using viral contests to get more emails.In all the examples above, they used KingSumo giveaways. That was a great tool 2 years ago, but now it\u2019s dated and not even supported anymore.Here at VYPER we saw an opportunity to come into the market and innovate on the idea of viral contests.This is how we did it:We took ALL the features of KingSumo giveaways, and added:Opt-in bribes which increased conversions by 26% (learn more).Automatic cheating detection.Customizable landing page that fits your site\u2019s look & feel.Conversion-optimized template that we\u2019ve A/B tested like crazy (including positions of buttons & more).World class support that will help you set up your contest.And we\u2019re constantly adding new features (new templates coming soon).Ready to create your first contest?Originally published at VYPER.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "The 4 Contest Email Follow-ups that Get You Viral Growth", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth/the-4-contest-email-follow-ups-that-get-you-viral-growth-6235c29814?source=search_post", "author_name": "VYPER Growth Hacks Blog", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypergrowth", "publish_date": "2016-04-23", "last_modified_date": "2018-03-09", "readtime": "2.48", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "The 4 Contest Email Follow-ups that Get You Viral GrowthVYPER Growth Hacks BlogFollowApr 23, 2016 \u00b7 3 min readWhen you create your first contest through VYPER, it\u2019s not just going to be set it and forget it. You have to do a little bit of creative positioning to get your contestants sharing your contest. This sequence activates your current & new audience to enter & share your contest.Note that this sequence assumes you\u2019re running a contest for 2 weeks. If longer than that, you should definitely do even more email blasts in between. However, we found that 2 week contests do really well.FREE DOWNLOAD: The Best Growth Hacks To Build Your Business & Email List [Click Here]Email #1: Initial awareness of contestNotes: Sent to the entire list usually right after the contest launches.The first email is simple. Blast your entire list that you\u2019re offering a new contest. Hype it up. Tell people about the opt-in bribe.Email #2: Triple your chances of winning our contestNotes: Sent to the entire list 5\u20136 days after the contest launches.Potential subject lines:Triple your chances of winning our contestHere\u2019s a secret \u201ctip\u201d to winning our contestThis email activates the social sharing aspect of your contest. If you\u2019re going to get people sharing, make sure they know that they can share the contest to get extra entries.Email #2 alternative: Opt-in bribe for sharing on Twitter or FacebookNotes: If you\u2019re using an opt-in bribe, let your contestants know that in order to unlock it, they must share your contest.One of the cool features of VYPER is our built-in opt-in bribes. This allows you to offer a cool prize to ALL your contestants, not just the ones that win. You can also take it a step further, by incentivizing your contestants to share your contest in order to get the bribe (this functionality is built into VYPER).The purpose of this email is to remind your audience that this option is there, and that they must share your contest in order to unlock the opt-in bribe.Bryan Harris of VideoFruit employed a similar method for his contest. You can download his full email here, but the gist of it is below.Email #3: You still have a good chance of winning.Notes: Sent to the entire list about 9\u201312 days after contest launches.Potential subject lines:You have a great chance to win our contestWe didn\u2019t get as many entries as we would\u2019ve liked, this means you have a great chanceEmail #4: The contest ends in 24 (or 12) hours!This one\u2019s pretty straightforward. Just let your contestants know that the contest ends in less than 24 hours to create urgency. In the email you might want to encourage users to share for more entries again.Bonus: Include it in the PS. link in your broadcast emails.The Hustle does this really well with their contests.

Fist jumping on a mattress with a wine glass, second the option to adopt/support a Koala in need. This shows the quality of the product and also adds an emotional pull towards the band.They are calling out \u201ccouples\u201d and probably targeting people in a relationship. Always try and align your targeting with you ad messaging (vice versa).What they did wrongThey could have added a lot more to the text area, no everyone wants to watch a video.They did not add a link in the text area, this is a lost CTA opportunity.Facebook Ad 2 \u2014 Lululemon MenLink \u2014 Live PostWhat they did RightGreat use of the carousel ad format showing the product in \u201cproduct + lifestyle\u201d shots.Did a good job at featuring the same model in multiple locations using the jacket for multiple use case scenarios.They mentioned features on each slide, makes users want to scroll through.What they did wrongAgain the text areas were underutilized, add a link to the product, features about the product, pricing, sale opportunity, limited stock, the collection (e.g. winter).They should have made use of the carousel card description area. Even if it is just the price or the brand name, this is an easy way to include some extra information.Facebook Ad 3 \u2014 Arcadia PowerLink \u2014 Live PostWhat they did RightGreat use of incentivization. Instead of getting into a pricing war with competitors they are adding extra value. Since this was a new product at the time and trending this added a lot of perceived value.Explained how \u201ceasy\u201d it was to get the Google Home Mini.What they did wrongNot clear what the ad is about, the image could have been more focused on the core product as opposed as a lifestyle shot of the bonus product.The title is cut off, make sure you stay within these limits otherwise people can not get the full message.Needed to use paragraphs in the text area to split up the text a little more and make it more \u201creadable\u201dShould have included a CTA in the text either to a link or click on the CTA button of the ad.Facebook Ad 4 \u2014 MasterClassLink \u2014 Live PostWhat they did RightAwesome use of celebrity endorsement, this is extremely powerful when socially validating the quality of a product. Who doesn\u2019t want to be taught how to cook like Gordon or play basketball like Curry.This is a gifting ad but cold quite easily be a prospecting ad as well. The benefit of the gifting ad is that you have multiple friends that come to mind with each \u201cskill\u201d being taught. Much better than using a single image ad.What they did wrongCould have split the text into 2 sentences. First explaining why this is a good gift idea. Then secondly explaining the quality of the gift.Could have added special pricing for a gift subscription and made it a limited offer.Could have turned this into a BOGO. Buy a subscription for a friend and get 6 months free for yourself.FREE Guide: What we learned from spending $100 million on Facebook ads! [Download Here]Facebook Ad 5 \u2014 JumpcutLink \u2014 Live PostWhat they did RightThis is a personal ad that looks very organic. This would be fantastic for remarketing if they were already familiar with who this is.Great use of the creative size. This ad is using a very tall ratio which will take up the whole screen.They have added captions to help people who do not have sound enabled.Have created scarcity around the closing time for the sale.Cleverly they are only giving away 12 months instead of a lifetime account.What they did wrongDid not include the value of the course while it was not on sale. E.g. \u201cthis course usually costs over $699 a year but if you enroll before 11:59pm PST you can get it for only %97 (that\u2019s 96% OFF the regular price)\u201dThey should have tried to get the link above the \u201cview more\u201d cut off. This would have improved CPC and CTR.Facebook Ad 6 \u2014 Mighty AudioLink \u2014 Live PostWhat they did RightThis is a great example of leveraging another brand to make your product more authoritative.Great use of a collaboration offer and using the brands\u2019 logos in the image help demonstrate the partnership as well.If they were targeting people interest in Spotify they would have been able to get instant recognition and trust from that audience.Very clear function and value proposition.What they did wrongCould have added a list of all the times you would want to use Spotify without a phone. This would have helped people connect with the ad. You want to generate that \u201cyeah.. me too\u201d feeling.This ad would not have looked very organic in the Facebook newsfeed. Using a lifestyle shot with a smaller logo and product feature might have made this a little less \u201cad\u201d looking.Facebook Ad 7 \u2014 Mama HomeLink \u2014 Live PostWhat they did RightThis ad is a fantastic demonstration of what the product does. It gives a lot of examples, clear explanation of how it works and what it does. Even better they do this quickly.the copy is using emojis to break it up.They are using arrows to the CTA as well as telling people where to click.Calling out free shipping as another advantage.What they did wrongThe first frame shouldn\u2019t have been a pregnant lady, it should have been an example of their most popular demo or use. E.g. leg waxing or a nose pore cleaning.They might have been able to use a shorter link, this would have taken up less space on mobile ads.They did not mention the price. This would have been a good split test but using the price in the ad can prep visitors to buy.Facebook Ad 8 \u2014 PatagoniaLink \u2014 Live PostWhat they did RightFantastic image creative, showing items that all make up an outfit.They are appealing to people who value social/corporate responsibility. This probably aligns with their target market/ideal persona. They could also target interest groups that include charities, sustainability etc.Great explainer of the process they use to make their product, this also increases the perceived value of this product.What they did wrongThe text needs to be formatted so that it is easier to read. Use of emojis, symbols or paragraphs would have helped get the point across easier.They could have also included a link in the text.If they had a short video on the process this would have done better in terms of capturing peoples attention, then tagging products in on video or even remarketing people who watch over 50% of the video.Facebook Ad 9 \u2014 MentorboxLink \u2014 Live PostWhat they did RightAgain, great use of the tall video takes up the whole screen on mobile. On a desktop you get the blurred buffer on each side but it is a small price to pay to take up so much real estate in the feed.Got to 3 million views, this must have cost a LOT of money considering their engagement is so low.Organic looking post.What they did wrongNo captions on this is a huge conversion killer. Especially because the video size is optimized for video as well. Facebook has auto-translate as well as .srt file uploads.Very little information and no link in the text area.The backdrop should have been all books so the video creative was balanced and people would focus on the speaker instead of the cars on the highway in the bottom left. Make sure you set up 1 focal point in your videos.Facebook Ad 10 \u2014 MooLink \u2014 Live PostWhat they did RightUsing Press or Customer quotes are a great way to build trust and social validation.Using a \u201cunique\u201d image + product placement.Out of most peoples control but having a verified page helps, ask your Facebook rep if you are eligible!!!!Offering a discount, if this was a remarketing campaign to push me over the edge to complete my purchase.What they did wrongThey could have made the image more engaging. E.g. used an impressive design on the business cards, use a unique shape or fabric to show of the customizability of the service.Included more benefits of the product under the quote in the text area. It was great adding the quote but then what\u2026.. why is the product such high quality? how do they create a good first impression?As you can see there are many aspects that go into making a successful ad. The key take aways are.Make your ads stand out by being unique.Use a creative image or video sizes (square or 4:5 ratio)A lot can be done in the text area, use emojis, links, paragraphs, CAPS, lines, arrows. Whatever you can to make the text easy to read, entertaining and educational.Make sure your ad engages, teaches or entertains. You need to give someone a reason to stop scrolling!!!!FREE Guide: What we learned from spending $100 million on Facebook ads!

There is a walkthrough video below as well as these guided steps.If you\u2019re running a contest or giveaway you can choose a prize like usual. Something that is of high value to your target marketing is always good.But if you\u2019re creating an evergreen lead magnet, it\u2019s best to choose coupon codes or digital assets as the milestone rewards.You can see an example of the evergreen milestone reward on this post. Unlock guides and digital assets for completing bonus actions and referring others to collect points. Once you reach 100 points you unlock a reward.First, grab users attention with a punchy one-line notification (see above or to the bottom left of screen), as soon as visitors hover over the notification it expands into the lead capture form.You can be used as a contest or an evergreen lead capture tool.Below you can see a snapshot of what the expanded state of the widget looks like. This section allows you to add more information to your \u201chook\u201d which is usually a reward or prize in exchange for an email.The example below is to get access to a video training library but a few other hooks you could use are:A contest or giveaway (win XXXXX, winners drawn weekly)A downloadable guide, checklist or cheatsheetDiscounts (get $10 off)Free plus shipping (get a free pair of sunglasses \u2014 coupon 100% off product, just pay shipping)Access to something (videos, members area, event, course etc)Below you can see an example of how you can also add extra fields that show up after the visitor start typing their email in if you like.Great for collecting phone number, gender, website, location etc. This is used to collect more information on your lead if you wish to.Once the entrant enters, you are then confronted with a few options.Wither you use this as a milestone reward tool or a contest tool the below are the basic fundamentals as to how we get people to either refer others to your business or complete bonus actions (share, follow or engage)From the 1 widget we allow website visitors to see:How many points they haveHow they can earn more pointsHow many points until they unlock their next rewardBelow is a quick video on how to set up and use the widget. The main things to remember is \u201cwhat can I offer my website visitors that will get them excited?\u201d.People are getting harder and harder to engage, the \u201cwhat\u2019s in it for me\u201d factor is higher than ever. If you want to get visitors to follow you, share your content and hand over an email address, you need to offer them something GOOD!Some ideas on how to use the widget for growthAdd contests or giveaways to any page. Just add a line of code in the <body>, it will take you 30 seconds.Discount milestones. Use the usual discount offer \u2014 $5 off in exchange for your email, then they enter the VYPER growth points system. As they collect points they get higher discounts. Require them to refer friends, share content, follow on social and more to get $10 off, then $20 off etc.Use this widget as an evergreen referral tool. Get visitors to refer others to unlock rewards (content, downloads, access, discounts, free product etc).E.g. Refer 5 people get our free growth hacking course (valued $1299).Take your content upgrades to the next level. Require visitors to complete actions like watching a video or share a post to unlock the content upgrade. (see the example on this page)So, now that getting your users to engage, share and communicate with your brand is easier than ever.

ENJOY \ud83d\ude01I usually take notes no matter where I am. You never know when that 1 piece of key information will show up and align all your stars.More often than not, you I get an idea or solution to my problems in the least expected moments.These are the notes I took over the few days spent at StartCon 2018. I also condensed these down a little to only include the most important information.Please, note I did not go to all presentations so I\u2019m sure there were a lot of things I missed but these where the big impact talks I saw!Brendan Yell \u2014 Director at Sendgrid Email is still one of the top converting acquisition channels and Brendan shared some great stats they have collected from the users of SendGrid.3 words in the subject line for cold emails usually perform the best.As a company, you need to figure out what your overall CPA (cost per acquisition) is to know how much you can spend on ads to build your email list.Map out your exact funnel. Where do people first hear about you? when do they signup to your list? when do they convert?Content discoveryEmail sign upHow many ads do they seeDo they watch video contentWhen do they convertAb test 1 thing at a time. It is easy to get carried away with testing but the best thing to do is choose 1 thing at a time to A/B split test.Use segmentation to get personal. Just using their first name is not good enough. You need to segment and really understand at talk to that customer\u2019s pain point. Some easy segmentations are:How often they use your productHow long they have been using your productLead or customerHappy customer or notAim to deliver emails that are timely, relevant, personal, regional.Instead of having unsubscribed, use email frequency adjustment options send daily, weekly, monthly etc.More email marketing tactics and advice hereNavin Danapal \u2014 SOSV China Accelerator Was super excited to see this talk as I find the Chineses and Indian markets to be the up and coming. Not only do they have huge populations but the countries middle class is growing unlike the shrinking ones in the United States, Australia, and Europe.The next large market to service is China with 1 trillion eCommerce spend a year now.This market is lacking in saas and marketing products to feed this huge online economy.China is a lot harder for startups to work with. One big deterrent is having to potentially hand over your product source code to the Chinese government.WeChat pay integration is one of the top payment processors in the country, that along with AliPay from AliExpress.15 trillion mobile payments of which 50% are conducted through AliPay, think of it as an alternative to Stripe.WeChat has differentiated from a \u201cregular\u201d chat app as it is a building back with a huge collection and marketplace of apps. An app within an app \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00afSocial commerce marketing is a new marketing \u201cterm\u201d that is building tracking. It simply means mobile experiance from start to finish, no desktop browsing or purchasing involved.E.g. you find the brand on social, ask them a question through WeChat, then checkout in that same conversation in WeChat.How can you make your business more seamless?Social engagements > content > shop > purchase (all on mobile, mainly in WeChat)Opportunities in China areAd techSoftware and SaaSHead to Beijing, Shanghai or Taiwan if you\u2019re a mobile and saas startup.SOSV accelerator gives you $120k in funding and is a 6-month program.

Check this.Suneet Bhatt \u2014 General Manager at CrazyEgg Wanted to see this talk as I knew CrazyEgg had been around for over 10 years and Suneet had been bought on recently to re-ignite the company.Focus on conversion rate optimization just a little and it will make a huge difference in your company.less than 30% of companies prioritize conversion rate optimization even though this can have the biggest impact on your growth.Companies need to focus less on acquisition and more on conversion and retention to win into today\u2019s marketing climate. In my personal opinion, it\u2019s a bit of everything, improve all of these 1% a week to keep growing.AcquisitionConversion rateRetentionJust spend 1 hour a week looking at your analytics and come up with 1 change to A/B test. Week after week you will get improvements.Talk to your customersWhy do you like our product?Why do you use our product?How did you find out product?What don\u2019t you like about our product?Focus on the customer. They are also people, so treat them like that, not a number. Too many people in marketing are not paying attention to the feedback they get from customers.Make something people like to use. Most people use up to 700 products a year. Make yours\u2019s the one they come back to time and time again.Aim for someone to use your product just 1\u20132 times a week.Andrew Lindsay \u2014 Business Development at Hubspot There are some huge case studies that show how partnership marketing has helped propel companies from 0 to 100 very quickly.Take Google partnering with Google back in the day.

I\u2019d like to share some practical tips you can implement to increase your email open rate, click through rate and actually get more cash in your bank account. Yeah that\u2019s a pretty big aim :DThe tips get more advanced as the article progresses. The last tip, which I\u2019ve never seen shared before in a blog post, will benefit you most if you\u2019re already established online with an email list (be that an E-commerce store owner, a blogger, software founder or whatever).Let\u2019s get started!1. How to Structure Your EmailForm follows function; The phrase was initially coined by the architect Louis Sullivan and is based on the principle that the shape of a structure should be determined by its function.You can and should apply the same logic to writing your sales emails, because, each part of your email has a specific purpose.Everything starts with your subject line.The job of the subject line, and nowadays the first line of your copy, is to get your customer to open the email. And you guessed it, the job of the copy is to get the reader to click on the link.You\u2019re not making a sale, that\u2019s the purpose of the sales page.2. Embedding Links: The Magic NumberGood email copy is structured to give your reader multiple opportunities to take the action you desire (in this case getting them to click on you link). The more links you use, up to a point, the higher your click through rate.You can see the results in the graph below from research Campaign Monitor did when they analysed click through rates from 500 million emails.Yet just placing the same link multiple times in your copy isn\u2019t going to significantly increase your click through rate.Click through rate vs number of links. Research by Campaign Monitor.Think of your email copy as a story. There\u2019s a beginning, a middle and an end. At each stage of the copy you are trying to get your reader to click on the link and leave the story.You\u2019ll need to use different arguments to achieve this.For example: you can open your pitch by appealing to a person\u2019s curiosity, follow it up with a list of benefits they\u2019d get by clicking on the link and end the email by highlighting the urgency of completing the action. Check out the example email above to see what I mean.3. How to Get Those ClicksThere are certain places in your sales copy where dropping a link just works. Embed your link after a list of bullet points that summarise the benefits of the product you are selling or after a product testimonial for example.Finally you\u2019ve got the postscript (which happens to be the second most clicked link in an email).To get those brain cells bubbling here\u2019s a list of six different ways you can use a postscript to generate sales.Images and buttons are proven ways to get additional clicks and increase your click through rates. The case for using a button in your email copy as a call to action is pretty clear cut.You\u2019ll find dozens of case studies, like this one, that show a jump, in this case 28%, in click through rate when using a button as your main call to action over a text link.An example of the A/B test ran by Wistia. In this example they saw a 24.83% increase in click through rate for the video thumbnail over the image.Another obvious way to use images in your email sales copy is creating a video thumbnail (obviously there should be a video to watch on the sales page).When Wistia tested video thumbnails in emails compared to regular images they saw a 25% jump in their click through rate.Another important variable to test that will have a huge impact on your success is subject lines. Check out this list of the best performing subject lines to use in your net campaign.4. Create a CliffhangerThink of your favorite TV series. How did it end last week? I bet there was some unfinished business awaiting a resolution in the next episode.Now think about how you run your email marketing campaigns. Do your readers have anything to look forward to next week?You should be constantly playing with your reader\u2019s emotions, think flirtatious girlfriend rather than American Psycho, to generate sales or increase click through rates.Also experiment. Create expectation for your promo with a free giveaway and then add a postscript regarding upcoming offer for example.5. Never Deceive Your AudienceObvious right? Not lying to your audience sounds like such an obvious step, but you\u2019ll be surprised how many marketers fall into this trap (often, and I include myself in this list, with the best of intentions). Yet these innocent lies, like that email you promised to send them, add up!If you say you\u2019re going to send an email to your list on a given day then send it. You mention your promotion or sale will close on a given date and time then close the offer at that time and implement that price rise that you threatened.When you don\u2019t do these things your scarcity threats become less effective and your audience will stop believing everything you say.6. Learn from a ProThe most successful email marketer I know stopped writing \u2018original\u2019 copy four years ago. Instead he adapts email series developed and used by marketing maestros like Frank Kern and Ryan Deiss for his business.An email marketing course by one of these guys will cost cost $2,000 and up.However, if you are making money from your list already and want to take your business to the next level then these courses are worth the investment.One of the best courses I completed was The Machine by Ryan Deiss. It\u2019s well structured and guides you through the system Digital Marketer use to manage and profit from their email list across various niches.The course includes access to a half dozen turnkey email series and some rock solid theory you can apply to your business.Now I know what you might be thinking; I don\u2019t have $2k to drop on an email course. And I can relate. It\u2019s a lot of cash to invest.If you want to learn from some of the best copywriters on the cheap sign up to a bunch of different email lists from successful marketers. You\u2019ll get a ton of valuable content, it just won\u2019t be in a structured format.7. Recycle Old ContactsGrowing your email list can feel frustrating. While you\u2019re always getting new subscribers many people already on your list stop opening your emails.Most marketers will tell you to get rid of these dud emails, because they\u2019re going to reduce your open rate, which is true. But\u2026Instead of simply deleting these contacts I recommend storing these contacts on a separate email-marketing provider. You don\u2019t need to put much effort in managing them.Every 30 days or so send a general email to these contacts; this can be a blog post, discount offer, re-engagement series or whatever.The open rate for these emails will be tiny. That\u2019s fine. You will get people re-engaging with your emails and your products though. When you do recycle these engaged customers back onto your main email list.There are no excuse for not doing this!Plenty of companies offer free trials for up to 2,000 subscribers so it doesn\u2019t need to cost you a penny.You\u2019ll get better results, and more profits, from your promotions when you send an email series.8. Flood the Inbox (occasionally)You shouldn\u2019t use this tip to often as it will burn out your list, but\u2026 When you\u2019re pushing a hot product, especially when it\u2019s a time sensitive offer, the best way to generate sales is the frequency of your emails.During an average 3\u20135 day promotion we send at least 10 segmented emails.I recommend sending a minimum of four segmented emails during a promotion. Send your first email to open the offer.Follow this up two hours later with an email to people who didn\u2019t open that first email. On the last day of the promotion send another two emails (the second one to the people who didn\u2019t open the first). And that\u2019s a minimum!To increase sales segment your list further by sending custom emails to people who opened the link to those that just opened the email (the fancy name for this is behavioral response indicators.There\u2019s a nice post by Frank Kern here that should get you thinking).Just like when you\u2019re embedding links into your email copy, you need to be using different angles to get people to open and stay engaged with your offers (you can\u2019t bludgeon a person into buying a product by repeating the same thing 10 times).Compose email series that hit different emotional triggers, like emotion, logic and urgency, to maximise your click through rate to the sales page.9. Run Your List on Two Email Service ProvidersEmail service providers like Gmail and Yahoo use complex algorithms to assign emails into different folders (like the hated spam). There are a lot of factors to consider, but one which many people overlook is the company you are using to send your emails.So first tip, choose a company that only lets you upload verified email addresses (sorry Aweber). Once you\u2019ve got that sorted, an easy way to improve your open rate and reach more customers is to host and send emails to your list from two different servers/ companies.Running your email list on two servers will help you reach more of your email list.If you do this don\u2019t send the same email twice at different times, which would look spammy. Instead create two messages with the same purpose (here\u2019s a nice article on keeping your list engaged while sending valuable content) and send them at different times to your list.This will get you extra clicks, which add up quickly when you\u2019re running a promotion!FREE BONUS \u2014 7 growth hack tactices to double your websites revenue!

I\u2019d love to hear your feedback in the comments below.Or better yet, share some tips of your own that could benefit other marketers.That\u2019s all I have to share for the moment, but I still want to help you out.

Not bad!We all know what Product Hunt is right?This last weekend, VYPER was posted up on the site. We didn\u2019t plan for it to happen, but someone named Charlie Irish submitted us.Around 12pm I noticed we were getting traffic from Product Hunt after logging into Google Analytics. My first thought was, wtf? How?I went on to the site, and sure enough we were the 4th startup.My reaction was a mix of jubilation as well as horror. We had planned for a huge Product Hunt launch for a few weeks in the future, and now we lost several hours of planning time. We also had the timing of getting posted on Saturday, when the PH community was not super active. But it was time to make the best of it.I contacted my co-founder Jack and it was time to get to work.First we realized that we had some errors on our site that the PH community pointed out. We quickly fixed those (SSL certificate wasn\u2019t present and our sign up page was sending users to a new tab\u2026 DOH). Then it was time to get started promoting.Promotion StrategyFirst, I sent out emails to our email list, which contained approximately 2,000 people.During our software development phase, I spent time content marketing and amassing a list of entrepreneurs. By the time our launch rolled around, we had around 2,000 emails on this list. I sent out an email to the entire list about our Product Hunt launch. About 16% opened this email. Here\u2019s what I wrote:If you\u2019ve been following some of my last emails, you\u2019ll remember that we\u2019re launching a new product called VYPER, an email marketing tool that helps you create giveaways that collect email addresses.So I had absolutely NO idea that VYPER was going to be hunted on Product Hunt today. We had a whole strategy ready and everything with a big pre-launch reach-out, but I guess the community was ready for us before we were ready for them =) That\u2019s okay, we\u2019re going to make the best of it and try to promote our Product Hunt launch as much as possible!If anyone uses Product Hunt, your support is greatly appreciated. If you don\u2019t use it, today\u2019s a great day to sign up (hehe).Check out VYPER on the Product Hunt homepage (probably will only stay there until tomorrow).Your support is greatly appreciated.Cheers, Kevin(The following paragraph is now debunked) According to our sources, upvotes from the homepage give you more weight, so we told people about our Product Hunt posting and linked them to the Product Hunt homepage. The reason for this is because Product Hunt has a ranking algorithm to prevent cheating.UPDATED: Link directly to your product page. Linking to \u201cproducthunt.com\u201d only makes it harder for people to find you and doesn\u2019t have any effect on the algorithm at all. It seems to be \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d that you\u2019re punished for linking directly to your product page \u2014 it\u2019s simply not true. Focus on communicating what your product does. P.S. Linking to producthunt.com is one of the clearest indications you may be \u201cover-optimizing\u201d your launch (gaming the system).Remember, Product Hunt doesn\u2019t like it when you ask for upvotes, so avoid doing it!Secondly, I talked to Slack groups.Not sure how well this strategy did for us because Saturday was DEAD in the Slack channels.My tip is to get well ingrained into each Slack group before your PH launch. Reach out to users in there who post interesting content and make friends. If someone else posts their Product Hunt launch, you should upvote and tell them that you did. This goes a HUGE way when you have your own launch. I had a couple buddies in the Slack groups that had done launches so I messaged them and they supported our launch as well.If you want to build up your network, Slack groups are a great way to do it.Third, I hit up people individually who were my tech-savvy friends.Pretty self explanatory, but the key is to network with people in startups & tech who know Product Hunt. Getting a 20\u201330 person boost was very helpful here. This is something that I never practiced before, but I realize how important having a good network of people in the same industry really is. Over the years I\u2019ve amassed a pretty large network, so it wasn\u2019t hard to get people to check out our Product Hunt posting.Fourth, I posted on Reddit.This strategy requires much more careful planning. This wasn\u2019t as successful as we wanted, but it still drove a few upvotes and I got about 2 emails from people saying they saw us on reddit.Here\u2019s what I posted in /r/entrepreneurGetting a Hunter (Updated)Product Hunt reached out and told us you no longer need a hunter to hunt your products. Here\u2019s an excerpt from their blog.Feel free to hunt your own product. Having someone else posting is fine, but spending lots of time \u201cfinding a hunter\u201d is a distraction. You know your product better than anyone else, and it makes very little difference who hunts the product and how well it performs overall. Follow these steps to get contributor access.If you\u2019re not sure whether your product would do well on Product Hunt, feel free to email me \u2014 kevin@vyper.io \u2014 for advice and suggestions.How did we do?Being that it was a Saturday and we had almost no preparation, our launch wasn\u2019t as successful as some others like Dollar Beard Club (apparently they got thousands of paying subscribers from Product Hunt), but we still got ~9,000 views to our site, about ~200 signups and a handful of paying members.We also got tweeted out by the Product Hunt team on Twitter and we retweeted their posts a couple times. Make sure you add yourself as the \u201cmaker\u201d of the product in order to get tweeted out.

Wanna know which one is the best option for your project? Keep reading to find out.In this article I will provide you a concise overview of the most popular Ethereum programming languages available right now.By the end of it, you\u2019ll know exactly which option is the absolute best for your specific needs so that you don\u2019t waste time and resources on something too limited or hard to maintain.Be sure stick till the end for resources to learn more about each language.Here\u2019s the table of contents:VyperSoliditySerpentLLLThe best solution for youFinal verdict1. VyperVyper is a language similar to Python. It belongs to the \u201csimple\u201d group of languages where the focus is on the contract\u2019s security by simplicity.Those who are looking for more security-oriented languages, Vyper is the go-to platform because the goal of Vyper is to create more readable and easier to understand contracts which are also fully transparent. Essentially, Vyper represents an amalgamation of Solidity and Python of sorts.Viper is the successor to Serpent. It is under active development, mainly by Vitalik himself.From their own github:Vyper is a smart contract development language built with the following goals:Security \u2014 it should be possible and natural to build secure smart contracts in Vyper.Language and compiler simplicity \u2014 the language and the compiler implementation should strive to be simple.Auditability \u2014 Vyper code should be maximally human-readable. Furthermore, it should be maximally difficult to write misleading code. Simplicity for the reader is more important than simplicity for the writer, and simplicity for readers with low prior experience with Vyper (and low prior experience with programming in general) is particularly important.You can find it here: https://github.com/ethereum/vyperPros:Simple to use and highly readableDifficult to write buggy code because less complex functions remove the risk of making a mistakeCons:Limited support for advanced functionsDoesn\u2019t allow calling external methods from other smart contract2. SoliditySolidity is an intentionally loosely-typed programming language, quite similar to JavaScript with \u201c.sol\u201d as the file extension. It is currently the most used and supported programming language.It was influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.The best way to try out Solidity right now is using Remix. It\u2019s a web browser based IDE that allows you to write Solidity smart contracts, then deploy and run the smart contracts.Pros:Intentionally simple to write secure contractsMultiple type-safe functionsShortages in the program can be easily rectified through alternative strategiesCons:Because of it\u2019s popularity is the focus for hackers to attack contracts so new vulnerabilities cause lots of damageLimited in posibilities. You\u2019ll probably need an external oracle for more advanced projectsUpgradable contracts are still hard to developYou can learn more about it in the official docs: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/3. SerpentSerpent is fairly similar to Python. Serpent has a minimalistic syntax and dynamic typing features. Originally, Serpent was developed for usage in real-time systems, especially interactive multimedia systems.However, the appearance of Solidity exposed the many weaknesses of Serpent and ultimately kicked it to the curb. Nowadays it\u2019s not recommended.The Ethereum founder said about Serpent:Being a low-level language, Serpent is NOT RECOMMENDED for building applications unless you really really know what you\u2019re doing. The creator recommends Solidity as a default choice, LLL if you want close-to-the-metal optimizations, or Viper if you like its features though it is still experimental.Pros:Multiple independent instances can run simultaneously in the space of one addressCons:Independent audit performed by Zeppelin identified 8 critical vulnerabilitiesThe biggest flaw lies in the fact that hackers may change the date in which the REP token contract was created, thus freezing up the token supply4. LLLLisp Like Language (LLL) is one of the original programming languages for developing Ethereum smart contracts. This programming language has recently gained more popularity.Just like Python, it is meant to be simple and minimalistic. For instance, the platform offers direct access to memory and storage, therefore allowing for a more efficient performance. The code is simple, clean and straightforward.There\u2019s an excellent article written by consensys about that language for those that want to learn more about how to use it here: https://media.consensys.net/an-introduction-to-lll-for-ethereum-smart-contract-development-e26e38ea6c23LLL doesn\u2019t hide the highly resource-constrained nature of the EVM and enables efficient use of those limited resources.LLL facilitates the creation of very clean EVM code whilst removing the worst of the pain of coding for the EVM directly: namely stack management and jump management.Pros:Removes stack and jump management for more efficient developmentCons:Although it is simple, it is widely considered to be too basicThe lower level coding nature of this language makes code harder to manageNot recommended for more complex projects due to its simplicityYou can learn more in the official docs: https://lll-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lll_introduction.html5. The best solution for youAll programming languages are developed to target a specific audience and cater to the needs of a specific user group. The \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d principle is rarely applicable in the coding ecosystem as different developers want and require different features.Moreover, the decision as to which program to use often is taken out of the hands of developers and lies with the business owners.As far as developers are concerned, the division of simpler and more complex languages is clear. Use Vyper or LLL if you are looking for simple languages needed for less complex functions and smaller projects.On the other side, I recommend you to go with Solidity if you want to work on more complex problems. Thus, based on your level of knowledge and experience, you will pick your language of choice.Solidity is definitely the safest bet as it provides a great balance between simplicity, complexity and the overall quality of the final output.6. Final verdictAs explained in the first part of the article, there are many different programming languages currently available. Depending on your needs, budget and vision, different developers or business owners choose whatever fits their needs the best.In order to minimalize the risk, my advice would be to choose Solidity. Why? It is the flagship language at the moment. In the past, developers opted for Serpent and then LLL but ultimately the appearance of Solidity \u201cretired\u201d them, to put it simply.Its combination of simplicity, multifunctioning, and the tendency to continuously upgrade and improve the platform make it the safest bet.That\u2019s it!

It was a very cool contest for people like me who could use those tools for our daily work. Of course, I joined without a second thought.Vyper.io concept is similar to Gleam.io and Rafflecopter.com which is not new in the market. So running their own Giveaway Contest is a good way to attract more people (potential customers).The registration process was simple and plain, they sent me an email to confirm and 10 points for verifying my email. The rules were simple, the more points you have the higher chance you win. Fair enough!You can get more point by doing some pre-defined actions, for ex: Like their FB, Join their FB Group, Review their course\u2026etc. Each action will give you different points.But to get past 500 points, you have to refer people to register through your link. Each person you referred will give you 100 points. At the time I joined the contest, the 1st position had 10k points, the 2nd had 5k points. To get in top 10, you must have at least 1k points.I was so into that contest with \u201cmust win\u201d thought in my mind. First I tried to find the Contest\u2019s Term/Rules to follow but found nothing but a line said that \u201cYou can\u2019t refer yourself or you will be disqualified\u201d. Ok, I understood.Next thing I thought: How to win this contest? I have to get at least 5k points to sit in top 3. That will give me a higher chance to win for sure.Before doing anything that costs money, I sent my ref link to all my friends on FB and emails. I messaged them and instructed them to register. I got about 10 friends joined, so 1k points for me. That action gave me sit into top 20 position.But I\u2019m a greedy person so I decided to start a FB Ads campaign for my ref link. (I still follow the contest rules) And here was the result:That was a smart move for me, I was happy to see my points going up every day. Yesterday, I got 5k points and hold #3 spot tightly. I was so close to #2, only 1\u2013200 points to get that position.And BAM! They slapped me in my face. I\u2019ve been disqualified for the reasons below. They didn\u2019t show any proof so I doubt that they just don\u2019t want to give rewards to people \u201cnot on their list\u201d.Without notification, that\u2019s all I get after spending a lot of time and money to promo their Contest. I try to find support on their Contest page but found nothing.So I decided to give up and move on.

I was excited to take a look at the Vyper team\u2019s perspective on contract design, but ultimately struggled to understand many of the design decisions.This post is meant as a friendly critique of what I found. Realizing that the language is still experimental, I hope it\u2019s helpful that I share my impressions sooner than later.First, I should say that although Python was my first language, I am muchstronger in JS and Solidity. So there may be \u2018pythonic\u2019 design elements which I misunderstand.Secondly, I will try to frame my comments with respect to the stated design goals for the language. They are very laudable goals, which are what initially attracted me to the language:Principles and goals1. Security: It should be possible and natural to build secure smart-contracts in Vyper.2. Language and compiler simplicity: The language and the compiler implementation should strive to be simple.3. Auditability: Vyper code should be maximally human-readable. Furthermore, it should be maximally difficult to write misleading code.I\u2019m particularly interested in the \u201cAuditability\u201d portion. Although the term is not explicitly defined, I believe an auditable language would include:explicit over implicit syntax (ie. function visibility must be declared, there is no default)low cognitive overhead to differentiate between types, and track state variablesThe code and my impressionsThe following is a toy contract I wrote, which is mostly a grab bag of functionality to see what I could get to compile. In order to communicate my likes and dislikes, it seemed easiest to just include it as comments in the code itself.I wrote whatever I was trying to do in square brackets, ie.[Declare a storage variable] followed by my comments on attempting to do that thing.

As the topic of the next part is going to be the type system, I needed to do some extra research and some experiments. Also, Vyper is still in alpha, which means the language is chainging. Just recently I was part of a debate which changed the approach to handling types in arithmetic expressions.]This article is part of a series I\u2019m doing on the new Vyper language for writing Ethereum smart contracts. In the previous parts I talked about why I dislike Solidity, and about the core difference in philosophy between Solidity and Vyper. I suggest you give them a skim:Part 1 \u2014 Why I think Solidity is a catastrophePart 2 \u2014 On the philosophy of VyperSo after all this talk about why Vyper is needed and why it\u2019s a good idea, let\u2019s get coding. We\u2019ll be implementing the Tribillium ERC-20 token, an absurd little token I invented for the purposes of tipping and gifting.Setting up the environmentThe easiest way to get into coding Vyper is via the on-line compiler at https://vyper.online/. Unfortunately, unlike Remix for Solidity, this is not a full-featured IDE with a test execution platform built in, just a regular compiler that will give you the bytecode and ABI of the contract.So to test our contracts, we\u2019ll have to use a local test blockchain. We could use ganache-cli (formerly known as testrpc), but it\u2019s a bit painful to do dev testing from the console, especially without the convenience layer of Truffle migrations\u2026 And while you can attach the Mist GUI to a ganache-cli instance, I\u2019m not a fan of Mist (to me it always seemed somewhat unstable)\u2026I suggest using the Parity client in private chain mode, as Parity has a very nice browser-based UI for deploying and interacting with accounts and smart contracts.To help you get going, I set up a Docker image you can use to kick off the environment. It\u2019s configured for development purposes, with single-signer Proof-of-Authority, some pre-funded accounts, a 5 second blocktime, 0 wei minimum gas price, and a block gas limit set at 7 million (slightly below the current annual moving average of mainnet Ethereum\u2019s block gas limit.)You can download the image source from my GitHub repo at the address https://github.com/daniel-jozsef/ParityPlayground. Please refer to the README.md there for instructions, I tried to make it as simple to get up and running as possible.Let\u2019s get codingSo I take it the test environment is up and running, you managed to log in with your browser, and you found the Vyper on-line compiler as well. Let\u2019s write some Vyper then.The first part of the Tribillium contract I\u2019d like to implement is the mapping for token balances, as well as the ability to buy Tribillium for Ether.Vyper is a subset of Python syntax, so if you\u2019re familiar with Python, you\u2019ll feel right at home. For those unfamiliar, in Python whitespace is a first class citizen, code blocks are delimited by indenting, and newlines hold meaning. Comments are prepended by the # sign.A Vyper contract is a lot simpler than a Solidity one: we have a single contract per file, no \u201cclass\u201d declarations. The suggested extension for Vyper is .vy, or alternatively, to enable Python syntax highlighting in GitHub, .v.py.Storage definitionSo let\u2019s create our contract, tribillium.v.py. The first thing we need to put in are the contract storage fields, in our case, the token balance mapping.balanceOf: public(wei_value[address])First, we give the name of the field (balanceOf), and after a colon, define the type. public() is a built-in that defines a field with a public getter function of the same name.Also, here you can see the syntax of defining mappings in Vyper. It\u2019s similar to an array definition, with the value type (in our case wei_value) first, followed by the key type (address) in square brackets. This is roughly* equivalent to mapping(address => uint256) in Solidity.(In case you\u2019re new to Ethereum programming: A mapping in Ethereum smart contracts acts as a key-value map, with log(n) read complexity. Uninitialized keys can be accessed, and have 0 / default values. Iterating over the key-value pairs of a mapping is not supported.)So let\u2019s do a quick detour to talk about Vyper integers. It\u2019s a lot more limited than Solidity, and I absolutely love it. There are two integer types: uint256 and int128. These types were recently renamed, and at the time of writing, the on-line compiler still knows them by their old names: respectively num256 and num.To be honest, the new names are a lot more descriptive, so I like the change. uint256 is for non-negative, and int128 for signed integers. That\u2019s it. Considering how in Solidity a byte costs the same gas as a uint256, this seems like a very good idea.As for wei_value, the name explains itself. *However, for some reason, currently it\u2019s represented as an int128, but sooner or later this behavior is subject to change, and will be a uint256 instead to keep with the \u201cde facto standard\u201d behavior on Ethereum contracts.Defining methodsVyper uses the Python syntax for defining contract methods, with some Ethereum-specific decorators available out of the box. (Vyper doesn\u2019t allow defining custom decorators, for auditability reasons.)@public@payabledef buy():  assert msg.value > 0  # We sell Tribillium at a rate of 1:1 to Ether  self.balanceOf[msg.sender] += msg.valueThe msg object is similar to how we access it in Solidity, msg.value gives us the amount of Ether sent as part of the transaction, in wei. Its type is wei_value (see above for details.) In Pythonic fashion, the contract itself can be referred to from methods as self. Unlike Solidity, Vyper at the moment has a single assert statement as opposed to a separate assert and require. Also note its syntax, it takes a boolean expression without brackets.As for the decorators, @public publishes the method in the contract ABI (this means declared functions in Vyper default to being private), and allows external actors to call it, while @payable is similar to the payable modifier in Solidity, allowing the contract to receive Ether through this call.When someone calls this function sending a non-zero amount of Ether, they get an equivalent amount of Tribillium transferred to their balance.Deploy and testIt feels nice to see something run, so let\u2019s compile and try this out. First, hitting Compile in the on-line Vyper compiler will hopefully end with check marks next to the Bytecode, ABI and LLL tabs on the screen, like here:If you have an exclamation mark instead, you have probably mistyped something. Opening the Bytecode tab will show you the error message from the compiler.Now, to deploy our contracts on the test chain, let\u2019s go to the Contracts tab in the Parity UI, and hit Deploy. In the following dialog, you can choose an account to deploy the contract with (since the minimum gas price is 0, it doesn\u2019t have to hold Ether), and set a name for the contract.In the last two input fields, you need to copy the ABI and the bytecode from the respective tabs on the Vyper compiler. For smart contract newbies, the ABI defines the public interface the contract exposes, while the bytecode is the actual compiled program.Feel free to hit Create, and confirm the transaction with the account password (for the test accounts, it\u2019s the same as the account name). You\u2019ll soon have a card for the new contract displayed in the Parity UI.Let\u2019s attempt to buy some tokens then. Open the contract, and hit the Execute tab, which gives you a dialog for calling methods. Since there is only one method, buy() defined on the contract, that will be fine. Using an account that has Ether, let\u2019s send an amount of 3 ETH to the new contract.Once the transaction is mined, on the contract\u2019s tab, you should be able to query the balanceOf public field for the account that sent the Ether, and you should be seeing 3 Ether (or 3,000,000,000,000,000,000 wei) equivalent of tokens shown:Stay tunedSo far we\u2019ve compiled a very simple, but working Vyper smart contract, and deployed it to a local test blockchain. Next time I\u2019ll be digging deeper into the Vyper type system, talk a bit about safemath, the alpha status of the Vyper language, and add further functions to flesh out our token.See you!",

JozsefFollowFeb 21, 2018 \u00b7 6 min readSo, after a near month-long sabbatical at a Rainbow Family gathering, and getting all my t\u2019s crossed after coming back, I\u2019m back at writing this tutorial / introduction series to Vyper, the new, still-in-development smart contract language for Ethereum.On a sidenote, apparently, Viper was quietly renamed Vyper recently. From what I gather, the motivation was that source files could have the .vy extension, which rhymes nicely with .py\u2026 Sweet.In the last article, I explained why I think Vyper is a great idea to begin with, and the issues I have with Solidity as the de facto industry standard in the Ethereum space. Now we\u2019ll start looking at Vyper itself, and go through a demo project from inception to deployment on Ethereum.I decided on a tutorial project I\u2019ll follow through in this series. I published an article yesterday that I\u2019ve had lying around, about a fun little coin I designed. I have some OpenZeppelin-based Solidity code for it already written, but I decided it will be an ideal demo project for Vyper. It\u2019s complex enough to show the real world usability of the language, and non-critical enough so that the big \u201calpha\u201d tag isn\u2019t bothering me. :)So throughout this series, I\u2019m going to follow through the creation of the trickster cryptocurrency \u201cTribillium\u201d as described in the article linked above, solely in Vyper.Following alongThe latest documentation for Vyper can be found at readthedocs.io. Note how it\u2019s still spelled \u201cviper\u201d there. :) This name change is probably going to haunt link urls for some time. The source code for the compiler, and also the docs, live on Github at ethereum/vyper.Vyper also has an on-line IDE, similar to Remix for Solidity. Unlike Remix though, it doesn\u2019t support debugging (or anything beyond compiling) at the moment. Still, it\u2019s a lot better than nothing.Also, at the moment, the link displayed in the documentations (vyper.tools) is broken. The IDE can be accessed via viper.tools (yea, right?) or vyper.online.The controversial choices of VyperThe Github readme pretty much sums up the core driving motivations behind Vyper. Its aim was to avoid all the pitfalls Solidity fell into (or rather, dug for developers to fall into).Vyper is a highly security-focused language. It prioritizes auditability above every other conceivable thing. Coming from an off-chain developer background, it might look downright preposterous, but believe me, on the chain, it all makes absolutely perfect sense.Flat files ought to be enough for everybodyVyper can be defined in terms of what it doesn\u2019t have. And the most important thing it doesn\u2019t have is the \u201c2i\u2019s\u201d: includes and inheritance. You can also read that as \u201ccode composition\u201d.Vyper consciously and religiously forbids any form of code composition you\u2019ve probably taken for granted since the beginning of your life as a developer. Chances are, your first ever computer program started with #include or some idiomatic equivalent. So your panic is understandable and expected.However, before you storm out the door in indignation, or raise an issue on Vyper\u2019s Github, you need to understand that the constraints an Ethereum smart contract must operate under are close to those of a punchcard computer from the 70s.Code composition in Solidity gives you the illusion that you\u2019re developing for a modern machine, with modern constraints, ie. \u201cif it\u2019s polynomial, it\u2019s okay\u201d. Not on the blockchain it isn\u2019t. In fact, it\u2019s surprisingly easy to write a contract whose installation cost exceeds the block gas limit. Using code composition makes it even easier.\u201cIf it\u2019s polynomial, it\u2019s okay\u201d? Not on the blockchain it isn\u2019t.So due to the limited resources, a smart contract should be as simple as possible. If you can shuttle logic off the chain while maintaining Integrity and Non-Repudiation (in my view the whole point of using blockchain at all), then do so by all means.If you can split your on-chain logic into multiple smaller contracts, then it\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest that you do. Say, if you\u2019re running an ICO \u2014 but please don\u2019t run an ICO unless you\u2019re a crook \u2014 , it\u2019s better to have your ERC20 / ERC827 token in one contract, your crowdsale in another, your timelocked vestings in a third, etc\u2026As a rule of thumb, if your smart contract is so long and complex that a single flat file feels uncomfortable, you\u2019re doing something wrong (and it probably won\u2019t even fit on Ethereum in the first place.)Another reason for shunning code composition in smart contracts is the nature of smart contracts. While a smart contract is not actually a contract in a legal sense, on public Ethereum, a smart contract is a social contract between the owner and the users, and inbetween individual users. For it to be a social contract, it needs to be readable and understandable by those interested and doing their due diligence.Flat files make that easier, too.So what about code reuse?!Software engineers are, by nature, extremely lazy people. In fact, I have a pet theory that the less lazy a software engineer is, the shittier they are as an engineer / developer. A lazy person will notice early if they are doing something repetitive and pointless, and look for a better solution. A non-lazy one will soldier through, cementing in the bad initial decision that made the code complicated in the first place, and pollute the codebase with avoidable workarounds.So since we\u2019re lazy, we hate writing the same thing over and over. This is why we came up with includes, libraries, polymorphism, operator overload, generics, and all that stuff that makes up modern languages in the first place. So how does that figure with Vyper and smart contracts?When I thought of not being able to just include ERC20Token.sol, I felt this gut-wrenching cognitive dissonance sort of thing. Yea I want security and auditability, but shit, I\u2019ll actually have to press crtl+c and ctrl+v\u2026 \u201cGod, I think I\u2019m gonna wretch!\u201dWell, what helped me, and might help you, is to start viewing smart contracts as an entirely different thing. They aren\u2019t computer programs the way a webshop or notepad.exe is a computer program. They are self-documented, self-executing business workflows running on a distributed notarization system.When you are writing smart contract code, you are not simply coding. You are also documenting.The merits of templatingJust look at how a lawyer works. They are faced with the same issues, of having to churn out many extremely similar contracts, say for real estate purchases, employments, mortgages, corporate mergers, etc. One real estate sale is very similar to another. A lawyer who does real estate will have a real estate sale template that they can use to build a real estate sale contract for a client.Instead of composition, say hello to templating. Manual templating at first \u2014 as I said, if manual is too much work, it\u2019s probably flawed anyway \u2014 , but in the future I imagine we might see automated templating, too. Maybe with parallel documentation in human language.Also, templating simplifies things that would be complex in composition. Most bugs in OOP come from function overrides. When you want \u201cthis, but not quite this\u201d. With a template, you just go in and edit it. (And I already see someone saying that in OOP you often want multiple slightly different versions of the same, but as I pointed out, you don\u2019t have the capacity on the blockchain for something so complex anyway.)ConclusionVyper creators made some extremely brave decisions. Not brave like \u201cremoving the headphone jack from a mobile phone\u201d, more like \u201cremoving the steering wheel from a self-driving car\u201d. It\u2019s a demonstration of clear product focus, and a better definition and understanding of what it is we are even trying to accomplish.The Ethereum ecosystem needs Vyper and the vision it embodies like Apple needed Steve Jobs back in the 90s. In the follow-ups in this series, I\u2019ll demonstrate that despite its alpha status, it\u2019s already a much nicer language to work in than Solidity.(update: click here for Part 3)", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Viper", "Vyper", "Solidity", "Blockchain"]}, {"title": "Ethereum ditching Solidity for Vyper?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/swlh/ethereum-ditching-solidity-for-vyper-6db70fd7754?source=search_post", "author_name": "Ashwin Crypto", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ashwin7143", "publish_date": "2019-03-10", "last_modified_date": "2019-03-12", "readtime": "3.45", "claps": 413, "voters": 26, "content": "Ethereum ditching Solidity for Vyper?Ashwin CryptoFollowMar 10 \u00b7 4 min readFirst things first, it\u2019s called Vyper, not Viper.Vyper is the successor to Serpent which is dead now ( *hissing fades* ). It is not yet ready to go mainstream since it\u2019s still under development. Vyper was not created to replace Solidity, but to be used alongside since it shares the same bytecode in order to boost security.Inspite of positive reviews pouring in for Vyper, some are questioning the need for another language to create smart contracts others are in agreement that security issues needed to be addressed.Vyper looks logically similar to Solidity but syntactically similar to Python. It eliminates many of the Object Oriented Programming paradigms and hence requiring a new paradigm definition for transactional programming. It has eliminated class inheritance, function overloading, operator overloading, and recursion as none of these are technically necessary to create a Turing-complete language.Should I learn Vyper instead of Solidity?The answer is quite complicated.Well If you want to be employed as soon as possible Solidity is the way to go. Currently, the most widely supported language out there for writing smart contracts is Solidity. It is currently the most documented and stable (um.. relatively) language out there. If you stumble upon something, there\u2019s a huge supportive community and resources that will get you up and running.If you\u2019re a person who is brave enough to experiment with a new language, and don\u2019t mind writing much simpler code, use Vyper. It\u2019s relatively new but it can create more auditable/secure smart contracts WITHOUT the features, community support and documentation that Solidity has.People who are pretty comfortable with Python will find the Vyper space better to breathe in. Vyper has a lot of features stripped down in order to enhance auditability. Smart contracts are supposed to be as simple and readable as possible, because these contracts can\u2019t change and minor flaws can spell financial disaster on a massive scale.Because of this, Vyper aims to provide the following features:Bounds and overflow checkingSupport for signed integers and decimal fixed point numbersDecidabilityStrong typingSmall and understandable compiler codeLimited support for pure functionsThe majority of the developers are speculating that Vyper is going to be used alongside Solidity in the future.When Vyper is ready, you will choose to use it or to use Solidity. Ethereum is planning to use Vyper for its future smart contracts. ( Confused? So am I. Ethereum still hasn\u2019t given any confirmation about the co-existence of Vyper and Solidity ). As far as the information flowing in as of now, Ethereum is planning to use Vyper for a majority of the the future smart contracts.Vyper is more on the positive side as far as security is concerned (Duh.) .It is more transparent for all parties involved, and have fewer points of entry for an attack. The existing smart contracts are vulnerable to attacks and contain security flaws. This is the fate of more than 3000 smart contracts as of now. Vyper has the potential to play an important role in the future and security of Ethereum.Keeping in mind the simplicity and security of this language, the following features have been omitted:Binary fixed pointRecursive CallingOperator OverloadingClass inheritanceInline AssemblyFunction OverloadingInfinite-length loopsModifiersYou want me to answer the question? Honestly, I don\u2019t know. At this point I don\u2019t think anybody knows. There\u2019s still a lot of time for Vyper to go live. Remember, the fittest always survive. Let\u2019s wait it out and see what Vyper has in store for us.If you wanna know more about Vyper, check out the official documentation here.Cheers :)This story is published in The Startup, Medium\u2019s largest entrepreneurship publication followed by +432,678 people.Subscribe to receive our top stories here.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Ethereum", "Blockchain", "Solidity", "Smart Contracts", "Cryptocurrency"]}, {"title": "Plasma MVP Implementation In Vyper", "post_link": "https://medium.com/layerx/plasma-mvp-implementation-in-vyper-5a3850e5b1b?source=search_post", "author_name": "Ryuya Nakamura", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ryuyanakamura", "publish_date": "2018-08-24", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-25", "readtime": "6.89", "claps": 461, "voters": 23, "content": "Plasma MVP Implementation In VyperRyuya NakamuraFollowAug 24, 2018 \u00b7 7 min readMerkle Proof Membership Check in VyperRyuya Nakamura(@veryNR)and Osuke Sudo( @zoom_zoomzo) from LayerX R&D Team implemented Minimal Viable Plasma in Vyper, a smart contract language that targets the EVM.https://github.com/LayerXcom/plasma-mvp-vyperTo our best knowledge, this is the first Plasma implementation in Vyper.

Vyper aims to be simple and human-readable as much as possible in order to improve the security of smart contracts.There have been a lot of malicious hacks due to vulnerabilities in smart contracts so far. Vyper is designed to prevent these vulnerabilities.Vyper\u2019s principles and goals in the document represents this well.Security: It should be possible and natural to build secure smart-contracts in Vyper.Language and compiler simplicity: The language and the compiler implementation should strive to be simple.Auditability: Vyper code should be maximally human-readable. Furthermore, it should be maximally difficult to write misleading code. Simplicity for the reader is more important than simplicity for the writer, and simplicity for readers with low prior experience with Vyper (and low prior experience with programming in general) is particularly important.Vyper is still under development but Vyper has a potential to be widely used when we taking these design goals and their importance into considering.We want to contribute to the Vyper community so decided to implement a Plasma MVP in Vyper. Plasma\u2019s contracts consists of various programs like signature verification, merkle proof, and priority queue so we thought this could be helpful for the development in Vyper in the future and Vyper\u2019s design decision.AcknowledgementWe implemented Plasma MVP based on OmiseGo\u2019s root chain contracts. We\u2019d like to express thanks to them and their \u201cgreat\u201d work.Special thanks to Jacques Wagener and Bryant Eisenbach, Vyper\u2019s core developers who helped us in Gitter many times.Vyper\u2019s featuresContract code in Vyper1 file = 1 contracts. There is no declaration like contract {\u2026}.Python-like grammar. Decorators like @payable, @private are used instead of modifers. Constructor is __init__(). Files in Vyper are similar to classes and you can access storage variables like self.myData and functions like self.myFunc().All variables must be typed explicitly in Python\u2019s type hinting\u2019s style.Order of definitions must be external contract interfaces -> events -> storage variables -> functionsA function can only call functions that are declared above it (that is, A can call B only if B appears earlier in the code than A does)Features not provided in VyperFollowing the principles and goals, Vyper does not provide the following features. (see the document for details and reasons)ModifiersClass inheritanceInline assemblyFunction overloadingOperator overloadingRecursive callingInfinite-length loopsBinary fixed pointWhat\u2019s Plasma MVP in Vyper like?Because of the features and restrictions of Vyper, the way we implement Plasma contracts in Vyper is really different from in Solidity.Differences due to Vyper\u2019s essential featuresWhat makes it different is the Vyper\u2019s features that follows the Vyper\u2019s principles and goals.(1) Use assert instead of user defined modifiersIn Vyper, you can\u2019t define your own modifiers for readability and auditability. For example, in order to limit the executor to the operator of the child chain, we use assert directly instead of using onlyOperator.assert msg.sender == self.operatorFYI, unlike Solidity which has require, assert and revert for exception handling, Vyper provides only assert. It\u2019s the same with require in Solidity.(2) No infinite-length loopSolidity provides while (condition) {\u2026} but Vyper doesn\u2019t. We can use for loop instead but the number of loop must be determined at compile time, which means range() only accepts literals. In our Plasma MVP, the upper bound of the number of loops are decided by fixed size priority queue. For example, the upper bound of number of loop in finalizeExits() is equal to the size of priority queue.# 1073741824 is 2^30, max size of priority queue is 2^30 - 1for i in range(1073741824):     if not exitable_at < as_unitless_number(block.timestamp):        break(3) Built-in secure operations and functionsIn Vyper, normal operators are made to prevent overflow so you don\u2019t need SafeMath library. Also, max(), slice() of byte array and RLP decoder are provided as built-in functions.(4) No inline assemblySolidity supports inline assembly. For example, a program which extracts r, s and v from child chain\u2019s tx signature can be written like:assembly {    r := mload(add(_sig, 32))    s := mload(add(_sig, 64))    v := byte(0, mload(add(_sig, 96)))}Vyper doesn\u2019t support inline assembly for readability and auditability. The program above is implemented with built-in function extract32() and slice().r: uint256 = extract32(_sig, 0, type=uint256)s: uint256 = extract32(_sig, 32, type=uint256)v: int128 = convert(slice(_sig, start=64, len=1), \"int128\")(5) OthersOnly integer literals are allowed in array access and arithmetic like exponent.Function arguments are immutable.Current Vyper\u2019s limitationIn Vyper, there are some proposed or discussed features without implementations or decided specification. In this development, we needed to handle these limitations, so we elaborated as below and we hope current limitations might be changed and we really would like to contribute to improvements :)Vyper don\u2019t have library system. We implemented all the functions in the same contract.A contract can\u2019t be imported from other file. The interface of priority_queue contract is written in root_chain contract.create_with_code_of() is used as a substitute for new in Solidity but with this function constructors aren\u2019t executed. We wrote setup() function instead and call it afterwards.Initial value can not be set in a declaration of storage variable so we set initial values in a constructor.Vyper don\u2019t have constant variables so we hard-coded in every occurrence with comments.Vyper don\u2019t have dynamically sized array. We used mappings with int128/uint256 key. Also, Vyper don\u2019t have dynamically sized byte array so we used fixed sized byte array with a appropriate size in the context or bytes[1024] as it\u2019s \u201cprobably more than you need\u201d.Vyper has struct type but don\u2019t provide defining new struct type like Solidity. There is a proposal about it.In private function, msg.sender returns the address of the contract itself. This is because Vyper use CALL opcode (not JUMP) in calling private functions currently in considering of the risk of side effects from memory access. This causes another significant problem that it requires more gas cost. (See discussion about it)And others. (Even private function can not return structs, strict handling of units, etc.)Experience of development with VyperDevelopment environmentVyper compiler is Python module and it is recommended to be installed in a virtual Python environment. (See the document)There are Vyper plugins for various editors. We used the one for vscode. (See the wiki about Vyper tools and resources.)Then, let\u2019s code and build it. There are two style about file extention, .vy and .v.py. We adopted the latter because truper (described later) only accepts .v.py.TestsWe used truffle for testing. Node.js module called truper compiles Vyper contracts to truffle compatible artifacts. Truper names artifacts like MyContract.vyper.json but truffle migration makes MyContract.json so the artifacts aren\u2019t overwritten. We wrote a npm run build script to compile contracts and rename them to have only .json.Vyper compiler does not create getter functions for public storage variables automatically. Getters required in tests must be defined explicitly.Because there is no Remix for Vyper ,we used truffle develop to see Vyper code behavior. vyper.online is a web app Vyper compiler. It\u2019s useful just to check a syntax can be compiled but it\u2019s not maintained well. (some relatively new features of Vyper can\u2019t be compiled.)Hard things(1) DebugDebugging Vyper programs is a little bit difficult. Truffle debugger doesn\u2019t work well with Vyper and there is no tool like sol-trace that tells in which line a error occurred.As a workround for now, we used console.log() in javascript test code and repeated commenting out some code and checking whether it raises error or not.There is a tool called vyper-debug but it\u2019s under development.(It raises error in pip install)(2) Deployment of RLP decoderBuilt-in RLPList() function is compiled to calling the contract which has the functions of RLP decoding. Therefore, you need to deploy the RLP decoder contract when you use RLPList() in your own ethereum network like truffle test in the following steps.Send 10 ** 17 wei to an account A (0x39ba083c30fCe59883775Fc729bBE1f9dE4DEe11) for a gas cost in step 2.Send a transaction signed by the account A which deploys a RLP decoder contract .In this way, the contract address of RLP decoder contract is fixed to the address hard-coded in Vyper compiler.We implemented a helper to do these steps. Please use it if you use RLPList() in truffle.TroubleshootingThere is less information about Vyper compared to Solidity and other programming languages so docs is the best source of information. However, docs is not explaining enough about some features and sometimes it doesn\u2019t reflect latest specification of Vyper.When we could not find the solution in the docs, we posted questions in Gitter. It\u2019s also helpful to see Vyper compiler. Vyper uses Lisp-like language(LLL) as intermediate representation so Vyper compiler is quite simple. For example, we found which type can be converted to which type with convert() function in the implementation of convert().Also, other implementation in Vyper is helpful.Vyper example repositorysharding1.0Casper FFGerc721-vyperUniswapContribution to VyperIn this project, we contributed to Vyper a little by fixing docs and proposing new features.In Vyper, proposals of new features is called VIP(Vyper Improvement Proposal). These are examples of VIPs we proposed.VIP: Constant Variables https://github.com/ethereum/vyper/issues/990 (approved)VIP: Built-in Constants for time https://github.com/ethereum/vyper/issues/1002Impressions of VyperIt was the first time for us to use Vyper. Vyper is quite simple and easy to understand.For people familiar with Python, what you need to use Vyper is not to learn new syntaxes but to know Python syntaxes not allowed in Vyper.For now, documents and tools are not so abundunt but we expect Vyper to be widely used in the future.

It is used for implementing smart contracts on Ethereum and other EVM compatible blockchains( such as Ethereum Classic and Quorum ).If you already have some knowledge of JavaScript, Solidity\u2019s syntax will seem simpler than Vyper\u2019s (which resembles Python).Right now, Solidity main\u2019s advantage is its widespread use amongst Ethereum developers and the big amount of beginner resources there are lots of tools available to make your life easier like Truffle and OpenZeppelin. Also, Solidity courses are available online and some of them are even free. Have a look at CryptoZombies.What is Vyper ?What is Vyper?Vyper is a general-purpose, experimental programming language that compiles down to EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) bytecode, as does Solidity. However, Vyper is designed to massively simplify the process in order to create easier-to-understand Smart Contracts that are more transparent for all parties involved, and have fewer points of entry for an attack.Vyper is a newer language, and its developers learned from Solidity\u2019s issues. They designed it to be more simple, secure, and easier to audit. As such, Vyper lacks modifiers, class inheritance, recursive calls, and a few other features that proved to be problematic in Solidity. Also, it adds overflow checking and strong typing.What is the most used, Solidity or Vyper?To compare which of them are most used, I used the GitHub search function to find how many contracts are written in Vyper and Solidity.What I have done is basically to search all files that have a file extension which ends either by .vy or by .sol since those are the respective file extensions of Vyper and Solidity.This search had a shocking result, as you can see by yourself: VyperVyper contractsSoliditySolidity contractsAt the time of writing only 160 contracts are written in Vyper against a whooping 311k contracts which are written in Solidity.The reason for a low amount of contracts in Vyper is because it\u2019s still an experimental language and even though it\u2019s going to be used for ETH2.0 the community and resources aren\u2019t there for beginners and the documentation is not as huge as the Solidity one.Is Vyper Turing complete as Solidity?First of all, let's head to what Turing complete means. A Turing Complete system means a system in which a program can be written that will find an answer (although with no guarantees regarding runtime or memory).The Vyper language is NOT Turing complete, Solidity is. At the same time, a program written in Vyper will always have a predictable output. A program written in Solidity will not have a predictable output until and unless it is deployed and executed.Vyper is intentionally not Turing-complete for security and overflow checking reasons which are one of the biggest flaws in Solidity.So why should I switch to Vyper if the majority of developers use Solidity?Even though most of the contracts are written in Solidity as I\u2019ve outlined before, there are a lot of bonus points for Vyper and it\u2019s doing a great job improving the security of Smart Contracts.Striving for simplicity Vyper has eliminated class inheritance, function overloading, operator overloading, and recursion as none of these are technically necessary to create a Turing-complete language. Also eliminated as unnecessary are the less common constructs; modifiers, inline assembly and binary fixed point.Things to be aware of when coming from SoliditySince the documentation is not as big as the Solidity one which has been revised a lot of times, I recommend using this section of the documentation if you don\u2019t find what you are searching for.These are some of the things that developers who want to learn Vyper and already know solidity should be aware of:address(this) -> selfaddress(0) -> ZERO_ADDRESSNo reference variables in Vyperrequire -> assertassert -> assert .. UNREACHABLEIs Vyper going to replace Solidity?Vyper was NOT created to replace Solidity. It was created to be used alongside since it shares the same bytecode in order to boost security. A recent study found more than 3000 vulnerable contracts (written in Solidity)contain security flaws.Vyper was created to be as similar to Python as possible, but is not yet a start to finish replacement for either Python or Solidity, but rather a language to use when they need for the highest level of security is required. Smart Contracts holding patient health metadata for instance.Thoughts? Questions?

It\u2019s written in a Pythonic way which appeals to me and as a more secure alternative to Solidity I think it has a lot of potential. I plan on writing more about working with Vyper in the future.Truffle \u2014 Too Much Of A Sweet Tooth?I\u2019ve recently finished working on a hackathon project and completed the 2018 ConsenSys Academy and during that time, for better or worse, I\u2019ve become pretty accustomed to using the Truffle development environment for writing code, testing and deploying\u2014 it just makes life easier.So, in an ideal world I\u2019d like to use Truffle for working with Vyper. After a bit of investigation I found this ERC721 Vyper implementation by Maurelian who did the work to make it Truffle compatible. I thought it might be useful to document the build process for use in other projects.How To \u2014 Vyper Development Using TruffleInstall VyperThe first step is to make sure Vyper is installed locally. If this has been done before you can skip \u2014 you can check by running the $ vyper -h command. There are various ways to install, including using PIP, the docs are here. I\u2019m using a Mac and did the following:Set up virtual environment:$ virtualenv -p python3.6 --no-site-packages ~/vyper-venvRemeber to activate the environmet:$ source ~/vyper-venv/bin/activateThen in my working dir:$ git clone https://github.com/ethereum/vyper.git$ cd vyper$ make$ make testInstall TruperNext I installed Truper, a tool written by Maurelian to compile Vyper contracts to Truffle compatible artifacts. It uses Vyper which is why we installed it previously. (See the next section for details of what it\u2019s doing). To install run:$ npm i -g truperCompiling, Testing, DeployingFrom your project dir (you can clone the ERC-721 project for a quick test).Run ganache test network:$ ganache-cliCompile any Solidity contracts as usual using:$ truffle compileCompile Vyper contracts using the command:$ truper* this must be called from the project dir and you must have the virtual environment you built Vyper in running.Truffle tests can be written and run the usual way, i.e.:Use artifacts in test files:const NFToken = artifacts.require('NFToken.vyper');Run tests using:$ truffle testTruffle migrations also work the usual way. For example I used the following migration file to deploy to ganache:2_deploy_contracts.jsconst NFToken = artifacts.require('NFToken.vyper');const TokenReceiverMockVyper = artifacts.require('NFTokenReceiverTestMock.vyper');module.exports = function(deployer) {  deployer.deploy(NFToken, [], []);  deployer.deploy(TokenReceiverMockVyper);};$ truffle migrateWhat\u2019s Going OnTruper uses Vyper which is why we installed it in the first step. If we look at https://github.com/maurelian/truper/blob/master/index.js we can see Truper is creating Truffle artifact files for each Vyper contract and writing them to the ./build/contracts folder of the project.Truffle Artifact FilesThese *.json files contain descriptions of their respective smart contracts. The description includes:Contract nameContract ABI (Application Binary Interface \u2014 a list of all the functions in the smart contracts along with their parameters and return values).

The good news is that now it is also open source (GNU General Public License v3.0)!What SmartCheck isSmartCheck is a static smart contract code security analyzer. It checks Solidity and Vyper code for vulnerabilities and bad practices. We use it in our audits and development and recommend to our clients, since it helps to detect many widespread flaws and increase code quality. Of course, we use other security tools, too, because there always are things that one tool detects and the other does not.We started building SmartCheck in spring 2017 and back then it was one of the first security tools for Solidity. Recently we added Vyper support, so now SmartCheck is the first and the only security tool that works directly with Vyper code (not considering EVM bytecode analyzers).ChangesIn the latest version of SmartCheck, the following upgrades were implemented:Vyper support addednew Solidity grammar usednew vulnerability search rules addedold rules improvedanalysis engine upgradedWhy open sourceWhy would users need SmartCheck source codes when the tool is available online?

This is NOT recommended for contracts where either full Solidity compatibility is not required, or no other compelling usage for using num256 over num exists. Notably, num256 is not overflow protected and may not support all the automatic security features of num as the language evolves. As the code of this token shows, the use of num256 over num also significantly complicates the contract code.THIS TOKEN HAS NOT BEEN AUDITED AND IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION FUNDS.

However, it\u2019s toolbox is almost empty. Contract development and security checks are much harder than on Solidity. However, SmartCheck already works with Vyper. So, I decided to present Vyper and SmartCheck in this article.What is Vyper?New Ethereum feature is Vyper, a child of Python and Solidity. Thus, it looks like a contract-oriented Python that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine.It is syntactically similar to Python, so inherits simplicity and readability. It was done in order to make Vyper code maximally human-readable so that users with little prior experience could understand contracts.However, from Solidity Vyper inherits not so much. For example, there is no class inheritance or modifiers. Moreover, some Solidity features like assert() / require() / revert() are removed. The whole list of features can be found in the Vyper documentation. The main role of such changes is avoiding misleading code and improving security and gas consumption. Except these alterations, Vyper works like Solidity, as contract structure and built-in functions are the same. Moreover, EVM is the same too.So, if one works with Ethereum, it may seem to him/her, that it is a great possibility to start writing smart contracts without old problems. However, not everything is that good, as Vyper is still in beta version and just doing first steps. Thus, developers run short of tools for Vyper. One can check the whole list of tools and suddenly there are no security tools at all.Let\u2019s check securityMany Solidity developers know SmartCheck, but now it also scans Vyper contracts. You can upload your .vy files here and check it for vulnerabilities. Let\u2019s see how it works.We have created a short contract, which consists of three functions (constructor, fallback and logic function). This contract is a game where an investor can deposit money and double them if lucky_time is guessed or lose a half of them. Contracts code:investor_money: uint256[address]lucky_time: timestamp@publicdef __init__(_lucky_time: timestamp):    self.lucky_time = _lucky_time@publicdef __default__():    throw@public@payabledef add_investor(money: uint256):    if block.timestamp == self.lucky_time:        self.investor_money[msg.sender] = 2 * money    else:        self.investor_money[msg.sender] = money / 2All we need to do is to upload a file (smartcheck_test.vy on the screenshot).And submit it for a scan.Since it is a testing example, there are only four errors. Let\u2019s take a look at this vulnerabilities and understand what\u2019s a problem.Locked moneyContracts including at least one function with @payable decorator should implement a way to withdraw ETH, i.e. call send (recommended), raw_call, or selfdestruct function at least once. Otherwise, it will be impossible to withdraw ETH.Private state variableInitializing the variables without the public function defaults to a private declaration and thus only accessible to methods within the same contract. Contrary to a popular misconception, values of these variables are still accessible for users. Developers must account for the lack of privacy in Ethereum.Redundant default functionThe payment rejection default function is redundant, since it is generated automatically.Timestamp dependenceblock.timestamp variable is used in the contract. Miners have the ability to adjust block.timestamp slightly and thus manipulate the result of the game. It can be quite dangerous if smart contract\u2019s logic relies on the exact value of block.timestamp variable.Try it yourselfVyper can be found here, and SmartCheck is available online.

This also makes formal verification easier. Problematic features like inheritance, overloading and recursion are not included. Here is a simple Vyper program showing some basic types and the similarity to Python:dapp_address: public(address)asset_name:   public(bytes[64])token_price:  public(uint256)@publicdef __init__(the_dapp_address: address,             the_asset_name:   bytes[64],             the_token_price:  uint256):        self.dapp_address = the_dapp_address        self.asset_name   = the_asset_name        self.token_price  = the_token_price@public@constantdef getDappAddress() -> address:        return self.dapp_address@public@constantdef getAssetName() -> bytes[64]:        return self.asset_name@public@constantdef getTokenPrice() -> uint256:        return self.token_price@public@constantdef getClientAddress() -> address:        return msg.sender@public@constantdef getBlockTimestamp() -> timestamp:        return block.timestamp@public@constantdef isEven(some_number: uint256) -> bool:        return (some_number % 2 == 0)Note that functions are private by default and that functions are made public with a Python decorator like syntax.KVyperFormally specifying the semantics of programming languages avoids many possible bugs. It is arguably true that all smart contract languages should be formally specified. The KVyper project is developing a formal specification for Vyper using the K Framework programming language design tools. Furthermore, the K Framework automatically generates conforming compilers from formal language specifications! Imagine formally verified smart contracts built with formally specified compilers. That is possible with Vyper.SupportThe Ethereum Foundation and many others organizations support Vyper. Vitalik Buterin and many other blockchain notables are fans of Vyper as well.ConclusionThe simplicity and security of Vyper may make it the right tool for many smart contract applications. Its agreeableness with formal methods is also promising. The smart design and wide support Vyper enjoys should continue to ensure a bright future.FeedbackFeel free to leave any comments or questions below.

Write my first article on medium2. Write a smart contract in Vyper3. Check the actual integration of Vyper in a Truffle environment.Let\u2019s start this day with Vyper!Why VyperBefore ask why Vyper, let us examine what is a Smart Contract. It\u2019s a Microservice with some functions to call in order to store and read stuffs in a decentralized environment? Yes of course It is. But from a non technical point of view a Smart Contract is a deal between a machine and the rest of the world. A deal to work in a certain way as long as the network lives.With this principles in mind a Smart Contract should be easy to write but must be easy to read.From the Doc:Simplicity for the reader is more important than simplicity for the writer, and simplicity for readers with low prior experience with Vyper (and low prior experience with programming in general) is particularly important.Simplicity first will mean that Vyper doesn\u2019t have: Modifiers, Class inheritance, Inline assembly, Function overloading, Operator overloading, Recursive calling, Infinite-length loops and Binary fixed point.Install VyperI\u2019m on MacOS, for different OS click here.Prerequisites:Install BrewInstall Python \u2265 3.6Install npmCheck if gmp leveldb are installed with Brew.Vyper is still in beta version, so we will install It in a virtual python environment.Virtual environment:$ sudo apt install virtualenv$ virtualenv -p python3.6 \u2014 no-site-packages ~/vyper-venv$ source ~/vyper-venv/bin/activateVyper:$ git clone https://github.com/ethereum/vyper.git$ cd vyper$ make$ make testProject SetupWe will use the init option of Truttle to scaffold our project.Fist we have to install Truffle:$ npm install -g truffleCreate and move to new folder:$ mkdir identity-test && cd identity-testInit the project:$ truffle initWrite Identity ContractThe project\u2019s purpose is to write a basic identity contract that represent who I am. My basic identity is made up by: name, surname and age, nothing more and nothing less than that.In contracts folder create a file named Identity.v.py ( yes we can use python syntax highlighter).Declare five public variables:owner is the owner\u2019s address that create the contractfirstname and surname are bytes32 representation of the name and surname.birth is a int128 represent a birth\u2019s timestamp. ( if I use negative timestamp \u2014 date before 1970 \u2014 , assert birth < block.timestamp revert my transaction, write in comment if you know why).creationTime timestamp represent the date when identity is created.Declare a creation Event:Constructor:We define:a public __init__ function that takes: firstname, surname and birth.we check that our function parameters are not empty ( N.B. assert not not _firstname is equal to assert _firstname != 0x000000000000000)we define our public variables.we log the Creation eventFirst name Update Function:Here we update firstname if: (i) is not empty, (ii) the transaction is from the owner and (iii) the new name is not equal to old one. At the end we return back new name.Fallback function:Fallback functions are triggered when the function signature does not match any of the available functions or when someone try to send ether to our contract.If someone try to send ether to our contract we send It back.Truffle IntegrationTruffle doesn\u2019t yet support Vyper contracts so we need some tool to compile Vyper to Truffle\u2019s compatible artifacts. Truper save us!Install Truper:$ npm install -g truperCreate a package file:$ npm initInto scripts field add the following scripts:\"scripts\": {  \"build:sol\": \"truffle compile\",  \"build:vyper\": \"truper\",  \"build\": \"npm run build:sol && npm run build:vyper\",  \"console\": \"truffle console\",  \"migrate:ganache\": \"truffle migrate --network ganache\",  \"migrate:mainnet\": \"truffle migrate --network mainnet\",  \"test\": \"truffle test\"},Now we can run the build task to build vyper and solidity contract into /build folder (N.B. remember to run It into virtualenv).$ npm run buildTestOne of the most interesting thing about our Truffle integration is that we can easily test our code.Create a new file Identity.test.js into test folder.Add momentjs and bluebird:$ npm install moment bluebirdNow we test our constructor function:In order to test our constuctor we have two main \u201cblocks\u201d:Fail Case: We test if contract creation fail (i) with an empty value and (ii) if we sand value in transaction.Success Case: We test if first name, surname, owner and birth have correct values. Notice we have to convert bytes32 in utf8 with web3.toUtf8() and bigNumber into string with toString(10)UpdateFistName test:Fail Case: We test if function fail with (i) transaction from a non owner address (ii) new name is empty and (iii) new name is equal to old name.Success Case: We test if new first name has new value.Fallback test:Fallback function send back transaction value excluding transaction fee, so we check the balance of the sender at the beginning and at the end of transaction.Now run $ npm run testDeploy To Main netNow we doploy our contract to the main net. I will use Infura as connection provider to Ethereum.First we have to install HDWalletProvider to handle the transaction signing as well as the connection to the Ethereum network.$ npm install truffle-hdwallet-providerNext in truffle.js we have to setup our wallet provider:mnemoric: is the 12 seed words of your wallet.infura api key: key after you sign up to Infura.gasPrice: check Eth Gas Station to know the current gas price (N.B. gasPrice is in wei, ethGasStation in Gwei).Run $ npm run migrate:mainnetThet\u2019s all.

To get you ready for the event (and because we\u2019re just too damn hyped to wait), we\u2019re sharing some insights from a few of our amazing speakers.Check out our latest Q&A with Jack Paxton, Co-Founder and CMO at Vyper and make sure to reserve your spot for his talk \u2014 you seriously don\u2019t wanna miss it.For folks who don\u2019t know, what is VYPER and why did you decide to start it?I started working in digital marketing agencies doing paid acquisition (Facebook ads, etc.), then progressed into overall acquisition and spotted a huge opportunity for a real growth hacking tool (my job was to acquire new customers and leads as cheaply as possible). I tested out the concepts with some agency clients then made the jump to starting VYPER with a buddy of mine once we saw the results.Can you share a couple examples of badass/unique/creative contests or giveaways that have been run on VYPER?Most of our contests disappear once the account is paused but here are a few examples:https://vyper.io/c/756http://vyper.io/c/719https://vyper.io/c/654http://vyper.io/c/1098What if I\u2019m an early-stage entrepreneur without resources or much money \u2014 how can I come up with content upgrades or giveaways?If you do not have an existing audience you can use contests to get going extremely cheaply. A common and simple option is to partner with a complimentary brand and give away their products. The other option is to purchase the prize yourself to then give away. It will be much cheaper than using paid media and much more time efficient than content marketing.My top recommendation here is to just really spend some time connecting with Facebook group admins, community leaders, and industry influencers to get them to share with their audience if you do not have your own. Here is an example of a beta test we did: http://vyper.io/blog/case-study-using-viral-leaderboard-contests/In terms of content upgrades, you can just repurpose blog posts, checklists or short e-book guides to use as PDF downloads. As people start sharing your blog posts to get the content upgrades, it will have a snowball effect to attracting new readers.What\u2019s the #1 thing entrepreneurs should know about growth hacking in 2017/2018?Email is still the best channel for owned traffic but it is getting harder to acquire these emails as consumers become more aware of marketing tactics. Really think about how you can generate engagement and shares from your campaigns, as this will be a factor that helps you go viral. Paying for email leads one by one is so 2016 ;)What are 2\u20133 key takeaways folks can expect to learn from your Launch Summit talk?How to create viral contest campaignsHow to maximize and scale your acquisition campaignsThe value of incentivisation and gamification to turn people into brand advocatesWant to learn more about growth acquisition from Jack?

"content": "Moving Over to VyperVii SundaramFollowMar 20 \u00b7 4 min readLendroid is one of the first projects to completely switch to Vyper, with fully audited smart contracts.The Ethereum Foundation, in the fourth wave of its grants, lists Vyper development and Vyper auditing in its wishlist. That the foundation likes a particular language is usually a good enough reason for most developers to jump ship, but coders\u2019 struggles with Solidity \u2014 also championed by Ethereum \u2014 meant that Vyper had to work harder to endear itself to us. And it did!On the blockchain, where gas is dear and threats abound, there are really only two boxes that a smart contract needs to check to pass muster -It must be light and as simple as possibleIt must be secureEasier said than done.A freshly deployed loan contract, for instance, can guzzle up to 4 million in gas. Granted, we can take to recycling contracts to cut costs, but this is far from ideal. The security concerns with Solidity are another matter. It is a beloved language, painstakingly worked on by committed developers, but the toll, some would say, has been heavy. Over the last few years, a rash of attack vectors have been identified and the remedies have mostly been post facto, from the DAO onwards.Vyper is optimized, according to the GitHub page, for security, language and compiler simplicity, and auditability. We found we were in agreement with this. We began playing with Vyper to bolster ReloanR, a secondary market for DAI. It clicked and now we have decided to completely shift to Vyper as our primary smart contract language. For us, Vyper seems like a pragmatic way forward. It is a happy feeling to realize that Lendroid is among the first in the space to switch to Vyper, and we are thrilled about this journey.Here are some highlights so far.1. No more cross contract callsWhile most frameworks and their cousins move towards modular designs, Vyper can be fascinatingly monolithic. Counter-intuitive as it might seem, Vyper owes much of its robustness because of its monolithic architecture.Imagine a single contract that does everything \u2014 including loan kernel creation, fill, top up, position validation, cancel and close. It also takes care of filling in the token allowance at the outset.In effect, this does away with the need for cross-contract calls and all allied security implications. That\u2019s not all. The flow of the loan process becomes linear and logical when it\u2019s all bundled within a single contract.2. Minimizing unknown unknownsWe really don\u2019t know where an attack vector can pop up from, can we. The best we can do is to minimize vulnerabilities and Vyper is by far the most secure we\u2019ve seen. While we\u2019ll slowly modularize the architecture in subsequent versions, this monolithic framework seems the most secure right now.Fewer cross contract calls mean fewer attack vectors. An inherently lean style means a tighter code base and therefore, fewer attack vectors.Smart contract programming is not to be taken for granted, and the shift to a more air-tight environment in Vyper only makes sense.3. Faster, lighter, betterEfficiency has been a very welcome core feature of this language. Consider this. In the solidity version of ReloanR, a loan contract would require a healthy 1.7 million gas when deployed. This was still only half of what a loan process would guzzle in other lending protocols, but the level of consumption is hardly sustainable.With Vyper, a loan contract would consume around 800k or less in gas. That is a radical improvement in efficiency. And there\u2019s still a way to go. We believe the contract can be optimized much more and we shall do so, in subsequent updates.We have also been able to infuse a few nifty advantages to the contracts \u2014 like a locking mechanism, for instance. Say a loan is falling below the margin level. The wrangler is within his rights to liquidate it. But he can\u2019t; the loan position would be locked if the borrower chooses to top up the collateral. Cool, innit?As version 1 of the Protocol gets readyIn the two or three-year history of smart contracts, there has been so much progress, and so many risks and much uncertainty. Our aim has been to not just survive uncertainty, but to thrive in it. We see this shift to Vyper as a definitive step in that direction.We are and will remain a non-rent-seeking, open protocol. As we get the smart contract audited, feel free to have a look at the Vyper code here : https://github.com/lendroidproject/protocol.1.0/blob/master/contracts/protocol.v.pyOver the next few days, we will also release an updated version of ReloanR.

However since her birth people keep finding problems in this coding language, and are asking for a better one. Vyper currently begins getting more spotlight.This document is by no means an in-depth comparison between the two contract coding languages in Ethereum. Rather, I try to take a sample application to make a practical comparison, and see the difference when the same logic is written into these two languages. After compilation, as long as the logic is correct, the contract deployment and interaction should be the same no matter which coding language is used. Therefore I walk through several test cases using the bytecode from Vyper-coded contract.Hope this serves as the first encounter for those who have not yet seen Vyper, and can arouse some of their interests to further explore on this new contract language in Ethereum world.Contract to be Built: Open AuctionThis is a very simple application. Open Auction assumes something to be sold publicly through auction, and anyone (with their Ethereum accounts) can bid it with their own ethers.When the contract is deployed, we need to specify two pieces of information:Beneficiary, who will collect the highest bid after the auction time is over. This is represented by an Ethereum address.Auction time (in second), which is the period for the auction. Bid is accepted when it is still in the auction period, and rejected when it is over. The bid is transferred to the beneficiary only after the auction period.During the auction time, the contract is open for bidding, and keeps track the highest bid and the bidder as its state variables. When it sees a bidder with a higher bid, the contract will refund the previous highest bid to the previous bidder, and keeps the new one. The contract simply rejects bid lower than the current highest bid.Note: it is by no means the best and the most optimized implementation of an auction contract. There is much discussion on how to make an auction contract better and more secure. This is just a minimal contract to demonstrate the basic operation for an auction.Note: this contract code is adapted from the example in Vyper (link) and from a video from Blockgeeks (link).Contract Code: Side-by-SideSimilar StructureThe structure of Solidity and Vyper is very similar, and can be easily divided into three parts,State variables: where one can define the variables for the contract. These variables are kept permanently in the storage trie of the deployed contract, and can only be updated through invoking contract functions.Constructor: the creation code that is executed once when the contract is deployed. It is used to initialize the state variables.Functions: one or more functions are being invoked through transactions after contract deployment. Once invoked, the code in the function is executed (on EVM) and the state variables and other states are updated accordingly.Here is how the logic is implemented using the two coding languages.Just a quick comparison between the two languages,The coding format of Solidity is JavaScript-like (arguably), while Vyper is obviously Python-based. See how to define constructor and functions, and how to refer a state with self.There are more data types defined in Vyper, such as timestamp, timedelta, wei_value, etc.Visibility (like public, private) and other keywords such as payable are coded as annotation in Vyper.Of course there are much more difference when comparing the code, but these are just what what we observe in these two contracts side by side.Compilation and DeploymentLike any coding languages in other domains, both Solidity and Vyper come with its own compiler. The objective of compilation is to generate two pieces of information for contract deployment: Application Binary Interface (ABI) and Bytecode.ABI: it is used when we interact with a deployed contract in a human way (application with SDK or command line)Bytecode: it is the machine code containing the instructions, and is being executed by EVM when deploying contract and invoking functions.The tools I am using for code compilation isRemix (http://remix.ethereum.org) the online tool for Ethereum contractVyper online (https://vyper.online) the online tool for vyper contract compilationBytecode truncated in both contractsWe will not do a byte-by-byte comparison between their ABI and bytecode, as we do not expect both are generating identical codes. We also will not draw a conclusion on bytecode size and therefore gas consumption, as currently we have only one contract without going into very detail analysis. Nevertheless, as far as we can achieve the same logic through executing functions, we just assume both are working fine.The deployment of bytecode is the same for both Solidity-coded contract and Vyper-coded contract. Remember, both bytecodes will deliver the same functionality and logic, and EVM does not care what coding language the bytecode is developed from.Testing with Ethereum Simulator and Geth ClientTo demonstrate the compiled result, we are going to deploy the contract. Here are the steps we are going to perform.As both yields the same result, here I just place captured screen shots for code in Vyper.My screen is split into two: the right-hand-side is the ganache-cli Ethereum simulator, and it comes with 10 Ethereum accounts, each of which has 100 ethers.The left-hand-side is where I deploy contract and interact with the deployed contract.Step 1First we define the variable abi and bytecode. Then use the command eth.contract().new to deploy the contract. Note that eth.accounts[9] is the beneficiary and the auction duration is 600 seconds (10 minutes).> eth.contract(abi).new(eth.accounts[9], 600, {from: eth.accounts[0], data: bytecode, gas: 1000000})We obtain the contract ID from the ganache-cli windows. Now we define an object openAuction to this deployed contract. We use openAuction to interact with this deployed contract.> var openAuction = eth.contract(abi).at(<contract address>)At the beginning we see the Auction Start and Stop time (in seconds). Date.now() gives us the current time (in milliseconds). It is smaller than the Auction Stop time, meaning that we are still in the auction period.Also we see the highest bid is currently zero, and no bidder submits the bid yet.Step 2Bidder eth.accounts[1] submits a bid with 10 ethers. The transaction is being processed. Now the Highest Bid and Highest Bidder reflects this bid. Note that eth.accounts[1] balance is ~90 ethers, which is 10 ethers less than the previous balance (plus some gas consumed for bidding transaction).Step 3Another bidder eth.accounts[2] submits a bid with 15 ethers. After transaction is executed, the Highest Bid and Higest Bidder reflects this new bid. As expected, 15 ethers are taken as bid from eth.accounts[2], while eth.accounts[1] gets back the fund as it is no longer the highest bid.Step 4Another bidder eth.accounts[3] tries to bid with a value 12 ethers, which is less than current highest bid (15 ethers). The result is a revert per our contract code (assertion). Meanwhile, the Highest Bid and Highest Bidder remain as Step 3.Step 5eth.accounts[0] tries to execute the endAuction() function, which calls for an end of auction. However it is again a revert as the auction time is not over yet. Current time is still less than the Auction Stop time.Step 6After the auction time is over (see current time is now larger than the Auction Stop time), eth.accounts[0] now can execute the endAuction() function. Per the code design, the state variables ended is now True, and the highest bid (15 ethers) is transferred to the beneficiary (eth.accounts[9]).Step 7After the auction time is over, if any account tries to submit a bid, revert happens as the bid is accepted only in the auction period (assertion).Step 8If anyone tries to execute endAuction() again, revert happens, as the whole auction has already ended.Closing and Further ReferenceThe structure of Vyper is almost the same as Solidity (and in fact all smart contract coding in other blockchain frameworks looks quite similar at all). Using Vyper\u2019s compiler we can get back both the ABI and bytecode, and deploy and interact with the contract with our normal way.If you are interested to know more about Vyper, there is a resource list in this site.

In order to accomplish that you\u2019ll need to create an interface:First, we define our ERC20Token interface. Notice we only have to include the functions we want to expose to our contract.Second, we establish a storage variable of type ERC20Token, so we can reference the external contract across our contract functions (I don\u2019t recommend this if you only need to call the external contract once).Finally, in our contract\u2019s constructor (or in any function), we can establish a reference to the external contract using the syntax ContractInterface(contract_address). We can now call the external contract\u2019s methods. In this example, we\u2019re calling the approve function of the ERC20Token contract, granting the Uniswap exchange approval to transfer our contract\u2019s tokens.If you also need to send value in your function call, see this post on how to send value in an external contract call.FYI, these code examples use vyper version: 0.1.0b10Happy coding!

This can be a pain.I made a small library that ~~swerves~~ past this restriction. We\u2019ll discuss that in a moment. I\u2019ll briefly review Vyper before analyzing the library.Source: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*bgBCdx65C6_w6XztyRXfYg.pngVyperis a language built to interact with smart contracts on Ethereum. According to Vitalik:Vyper is a contract-oriented, pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)You can read the Vyper docs here and play with it in a Remix-like, in-browser environment here.The Becoming Future team loves Vyper for all the simplicity and security it provides. We hope to contribute more to the (admittedly, currently tiny) Vyper community in the future.LibraryLet\u2019s now dive into a simplified version of my implementation. Checkout and fork the repo here! I made implementations for dynamic arrays of different data types supported by Vyper. They all follow the same format, so if you understand one, you understand them all. We\u2019ll be focusing on a simplified version of the uint256 dynamic array implementation in this post.MAXVAL: constant(uint256) = 2**255ls: map(uint256, uint256)currMax: public(uint256)@public@constantdef get(_idx: uint256) -> uint256:    assert _idx < self.currMax    return self.ls[_idx]@public@constantdef length() -> uint256:    return self.currMax@publicdef set(_idx: uint256, _val: uint256):    self.ls[_idx] = _val@publicdef append(_val: uint256):    self.set(self.currMax, _val)    self.currMax += 1@publicdef detach():    assert self.currMax > 0    self.currMax -= 1@publicdef remove(_idx: uint256):    assert self.currMax > 0    assert self.currMax > _idx    i: uint256    for not_i in range(MAXVAL):        i = convert(not_i, uint256)        if i == self.currMax - 1:            self.currMax -= 1            return        elif i >= _idx and i < self.currMax - 1:            self.set(i, self.get(i + 1))Here\u2019s why this simple code is useful: Vyper only allows you to perform range() on a constant-sized input, which is problematic when one has a dynamic amount of content to loop over. Operations such as remove() would be impossible without a tiny fix. Simply define a different, mutable variable (in this case, self.currMax) and loop along range(MAX) until self.currMax is reached.That\u2019s it!I chose MAX to be the largest value a uint256 could be in Vyper, namely 2\u00b2\u2075\u2076 just because I can. Clearly this destroys my space complexity, but at least all use cases are permitted. Feel free to alter this value to fit your own needs.I would not use the above implementation in production. I\u2019d use the actual implementation instead i.e. my library (found in the linked repo above and below and here). The actual implementation, my library, houses many security checks including whitelisted lists, which prevent a random person from accidentally or purposefully overriding your data.Checkout and fork the repo here!Analysis+----------------------+-------------+---------------+-----------+|       Feature        |    Array    | Dynamic Array |  My Array |+----------------------+-------------+---------------+-----------+| Indexing             |     O(1)    |     O(1)      |    O(1)   || Insert/delete @ start|     O(n)    |     O(n)      |    O(1)   || Insert/delete @ end  |     O(1)    | O(n) amortized|    O(1)   || Insert/delete @ mid  |     O(n)    |     O(n)      |    O(1)   || Wasted space         |      0      |     O(n)      |    O(M)   |+----------------------+-------------+---------------+-----------+where M := 2^256 (but you can tune this to your liking)(Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array)(Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53939725/why-is-deletion-of-an-item-at-end-of-dynamic-array-on-time-complexity)Thanks for reading!

As the number of applications utilizingpublic cryptocurrencies and smart contract platforms grow, thedemand for processing high transaction rates in the order ofhundreds and thousands of Tx/s is increasing.In this work, we present ZILLIQA \u2014 a new blockchain platformthat is designed to scale in transaction rates. As the number ofminers in ZILLIQA increases, its transaction rates are expected toincrease. At Ethereum\u2019s present network size of 30,000 miners,ZILLIQA would expect to process about a thousand times thetransaction rates of Ethereum. The cornerstone in ZILLIQA\u2019sdesign is the idea of sharding \u2014 dividing the mining networkinto smaller shards each capable of processing transactions inparallel.ZILLIQA further proposes an innovative special-purpose smartcontract language and execution environment that leverages theunderlying architecture to provide a large scale and highlyefficient computation platform. The smart contract language inZILLIQA follows a dataflow programming style which makes itideal for running large-scale computations that can be easilyparallelized.

If you just want to play around with packaging any vyper contract, feel free to grab a sample vyper contract from here.getting setupClone the starter repo linked above, and follow the steps listed in the Quickstart section of the README.md to install the necessary tools on your machine. This repo is by no means necessary to package up your vyper contracts, but simply provided as a resource to make the manifest generation process as painless as possible.hello manifestWhat is a manifest? A manifest can be thought of as the basic unit of measurement in the EthPM infrastructure. Each manifest maps to a version of a package. When you \u201cpublish\u201d or \u201crelease\u201d a package version, you are simply storing the content-addressed URI at which the manifest is located on your on-chain registry.This starter repo uses some pytest-ethereum magic behind the scenes to help generate our manifest.If you\u2019re all set up, copy and paste your vyper contract(s) into the devcon_iv_ethpm/vyper_contracts/ directory.If you want to customize your manifest name and version (which you probably do). Look for the \ud83d\udce6\ud83d\udce6\ud83d\udce6 in devcon_iv_ethpm/vyper_manifest.py, everywhere you see those, you should fill in the respective data with your desired values. Full manifest customization is not currently supported (i.e. deployments, build_dependencies) but it\u2019s coming soon!Next simply run this command from your terminal.python devcon_iv_ethpm/vyper_manifest.pyThis will automatically compile every vyper contract found in devcon_iv_ethpm/vyper_manifests/ and add them to a manifest.You should see the following output.Your beautiful manifest<manifest_output>Manifest: <package_name> written to <file_path>There you go!

Try our free VyperSDKOne of the most significant challenges for researchers, security experts and those involved in cyber protection in the Windows environment is to know what is going on inside the operating system kernel. Because Microsoft has closed the possibility of monitoring the kernel with the PatchGuard, the only way to do that is with a virtualization layer.That\u2019s why we at Viral Security Group developed a thin hypervisor based on hardware-assisted virtualization technology. This thin hypervisor (called \u201cVyper\u201d) is the core engine of multiple applications, all of which have great potential for commercial use.The core engine was developed based on Intel VT-x technology which implements virtualization at the CPU level. In other words, the running operating system (e.g., Windows) is not aware of being virtualized.To enjoy the benefits of the engine, a dedicated VyperSDK has developed that includes the Kernel Hooking Library and the CPU Registers Monitoring Library. Both are running \u201con top\u201d of Vyper VMM and have the capability of controlling physical and virtual memory access. As well as monitoring for debugging configurations, and more.Such transparency to the operating system kernel protects against malicious code attempts trying to bypass existing security mechanisms in the Windows API.Vyper SandboxTo show what one can do with the VyperSDK, we developed a sandbox based on the virtualization layer. The Vyper Sandbox is an environment that allows one to check how malicious code behaves as soon as one activate it.Because the virtualization engine can monitor all operations performed on the operating system kernel, the report provided by the Vyper Sandbox grants the user with full transparency on the behavior of the malicious code.It is important to note that the current version of the Vyper Sandbox does not label which actions are legitimate or malicious. For this, the user must load known malicious code signatures and \u201cteach\u201d the sandbox how to tag the results.In other words, the Vyper Sandbox is a tool to record the behavior of malicious code running on the operating system. It\u2019s a sort of malware sniffer. Nevertheless, this is a unique ability. The Vyper Sandbox does not trigger the malicious code to run by injecting code. An action that can cause the malicious code to understand that it is being tested and, as a result, trigger evasive mechanisms.Instead, the Vyper Sandbox allows malicious code to run on a real operating system when the virtual layer runs between the operating system and the processor. In this way, the malicious program does not recognize that it is in a virtual environment and does not activate evasive mechanisms.The user\u2019s ability to view the full sequence of malicious code against the operating system kernel allows researchers, and developers of protection tools, complete transparency.Sharing with the communityAs security researchers, we know how to evaluate the benefit of sharing information. And hence, we give the Vyper Sandbox and the VyperSDK free of scharge to the community of developers and researchers. The goal is to share knowledge in favor of improving existing defense tools.However, we maintain transparency, and it is essential to know that the Vyper Sandbox is running in the cloud. Any malicious code snippet that comes up to the cloud for Vyper Sandbox testing visible to all users.Organizations or individuals who wish to receive the code for the Vyper Sandbox for local use may contact us on a specific application form.Each request will receive a response.

This document covers the design specification, providing references to the implementation along the way. Our code supports deploying a new chain to testnet, an on-chain registry of other plasma chains and their block explorers, and transacting via a command-line wallet.IntroductionThe vision of a network of blockchains as a scalability solution has been spreading rapidly. A multi-chain approach for parallelizing transactions is a promising way to increasing throughput\u2026 unfortunately, it also imposes significant challenges:We don\u2019t want to divide security, e.g. 100 chains with 1% of total security each.Advanced solutions like sharding are promising, but not yet ready.We need a solution to scalability that:Provides similar levels of security to the Ethereum mainnet, without paying millions of dollars in mining fees.Can be implemented on Ethereum as it exists today.We believe that the strongest candidate to meet these criteria is a network of chains, each secured to mainnet via the Plasma framework.Plasma is a family of protocols which allow individuals to easily deploy high-throughput, secure blockchains. A smart contract on Ethereum\u2019s main chain can ensure that users\u2019 funds are secure, even if the \u201cplasma chain\u201d acts fully maliciously. This eliminates the need for a trusted pegging mechanism like that of sidechains. Plasma chains are non-custodial, allowing the prioritization of scalability without sacrificing security.We envision a future with many Plasma chains, giving users choice over where they transact. So, along with releasing our plasma chain implementation, we have created a PlasmaRegistry.vy. The registry allows new chains to join the network by listing their IP/DNS address, a custom \u201cname\u201d string, and their contract address. The registry contract does the verifies trusted deployment, so users can be assured that any contract on that registry is safe to deposit into \u2014 even if its operator is malicious.Properties of our Plasma Chain ImplementationThis post specifies Plasma Group\u2019s current protocol and implementation, which draws from recent developments within the research community.Our specification has the following properties:Single transactions over large ranges of coins, solving the \u201cfixed-denomination\u201d problem in Plasma Cash.Block size which scales with the number of transactions, not the number of deposits.Light client proofs which scale in the logarithm of the block size and linear in blocks since deposit, making the operator the system\u2019s only (computational) bottleneck.A simplified, optimistic exit procedure that allows exits to specify only the most recent transaction, instead of both a transaction and its parent.Interchain atomic swaps, which lay the groundwork for decentralized exchange protocols.Unlimited deposit capacity.Our implementation follows the above specification, providing the following:A command line plasma chain operator written in Javascript.A plasma client implementation written in Javascript with a command-line wallet.A smart contract supporting ETH and ERC20 tokens written in Vyper.An integrated JSON RPC which allows clients to download and verify light client proofs and transact.A block explorer hosted by the plasma operator.A simulated client swarm which generates transactions to load test.A Plasma \u201cregistry\u201d contract which lists a set of verified-as-safe contracts and operator IP addresses for users to explore.If you\u2019re interested in checking out the protocol and the code implementation, you\u2019ve come to the right place!However, a few disclaimers before we dig in:Our plasma implementation is beta software currently only suitable for testnet use. There are surely critical bugs at this time.The main difference (explained below!) between this protocol and other Plasma implementations is the block structure: a Merkle sum tree. This has significant benefits, but adds complexity. Plasma is already complex in comparison to sidechains.Code has yet to be audited or formally verified, and has not undergone any optimization.While the operator is the only computational bottleneck, the primary performance limit today remains bandwidth. Custody proofs require downloads which are linear in the number of blocks. Our code is an improvement per block, but still linear. This active area of research is yet unready for implementation.Though our safety mechanisms and exit games are both implemented and tested, we have not yet built an automated guard service, meaning challenges and responses must be manually constructed.With that out of the way, let\u2019s jump in! The rest of this post will take comprehensive dive into our spec, where the code lives, and what it does.Table of ContentsGeneral Definitions and Data Structuresa. Coin ID Assignmentb.

General Definitions and Data StructuresThis section will cover terminology and intuitions for the protocol\u2019s components. These data structures are encoded and decoded by plasma-utils\u2019 library serialization. The exact byte-per-byte binary representations of all data structures for each structure can be found in schemas.Coin ID AssignmentThe base unit of any plasma asset is represented as a coin. Like in standard Plasma Cash, these coins are non-fungible, and we call the index of a coin its coinID, which is 16 bytes. They are assigned in order of deposit on a per-asset (ERC 20/ETH) basis. Notably, all assets in the chain share the same ID-space, even if they are different ERC20s or ETH. This means that transactions across all asset classes (which we refer to as the tokenType or token) share the same tree, providing maximum compression.We achieve this by having the first 4 bytes refer to the tokenTypeof a coin, and the next 12 represent all possible coins of that specific tokenType.For example: the 0th tokenType is always ETH, so the first ETH deposit will give spending rights for coin 0x00000000000000000000000000000000 to the depositer.The total coins received per deposit is precisely (amount of token deposited)/(minimum token denomination) many.For example: let\u2019s say that tokenType 1 is DAI, the coin denomination is 0.1 DAI, and the first depositer sends 0.5 DAI. That means its tokenType == 1, so the first depositer will recieve the coinIDs from 0x00000001000000000000000000000000 up to and including coin 0x00000001000000000000000000000004.coins all share the same ID-spaceDenominationsIn practice, denominations will be much lower than 0.1. Instead of storing denominations directly in the contract, it stores a decimalOffset mapping for each tokenType which represents the shift in decimal places between the amount of deposited ERC20 (or wei for ETH) and the number of received plasma coins. These calculations can be found in the depositERC20, depositETH, and finalizeExit functions in the smart contract//Note: decimalOfsets are hardcoded to 0 for this release, as we lack support in the client/operator code.2. Transactions over ranges of coinsTransfersA transaction consists of a specified block number and an array of Transfer objects, which describe the details of each range of the transaction. From the schema in plasma-utils (lengths in bytes):We can see that each Transfer in a Transaction specifies a tokenType, start, end, sender, and recipient.Typed and Untyped BoundsOne thing to note above is that the start and end values are not 16 bytes, as coinIDs are, but rather 12. This should make sense in the context of the above sections on deposits. To get the actual coinIDs described by the transfer, we concatenate the token field\u2019s 4 bytes to the left of start and end. We generally refer to the 12-byte versions as a transfer\u2019s untypedStart and untypedEnd, with the concatenated version being called typedStart and typedEnd. These values are also exposed by the serializer.Another note: in any transfer the corresponding coinIDs are defined with start inclusive and end exclusive. That is, the exact coinIDs transferred are [typedStart, typedEnd). For example, the first 100 ETH coins can be sent with a Transfer with transfer.token = 0, transfer.start = 0, and transfer.end = 100. The second 100 would have transfer.start = 100 and transfer.end = 200.Multisends and Transfer/Transaction AtomicityThe Transaction schema consists of a 4-byte block number (the transaction is only valid if included in that particular plasma block), and an array of Transfer objects. This means that a transaction can describe several transfers, which are either all atomically executed or not depending on the entire transaction\u2019s inclusion and validity. This will form the basis for both decentralized exchange and defragmentation in later releases.SerializationAs exemplified above, plasma-utils implements a custom serialization library for data structures. Both the JSON RPC and the smart contract use the byte arrays as encoded by the serializer.The encoding is quite simple, being the concatenation of each value fixed to the number of bytes defined by the schema.For encoding which involve variable-sized arrays, such as Transaction objects which contain 1 or more Transfers, a single byte precedes for the number of elements. Tests for the serialization library can be found here.Currently, we have schemas for the following objects:TransferUnsignedTransactionSignatureSignedTransactionTransferProofTransactionProof3. Block Structure SpecificationOne of the most important improvements Plasma Cash introduced was \u201clight proofs.\u201d Previously, plasma constructions required that users download the entire plasma chain to ensure safety of their funds. With Plasma Cash, they only have to download the branches of a Merkle tree relevant to their own funds.This was accomplished by introducing a new transaction validity condition: transactions of a particular coinID are only valid at the coinIDth leaf in the Merkle tree. Thus, it is sufficient to download just that branch to be confident no valid transaction exists for that coin. The problem with this scheme is that transactions are \u201cstuck\u201d at this denomination: if you want to transact multiple coins, you need multiple transactions, one at each leaf.Unfortunately, if we put the range-based transactions into branches of a regular Merkle tree, light proofs would become insecure. This is because having one branch does not guarantee that others don\u2019t intersect:Leaves 4 and 6 both describe transactions over the range (3,4). Having one branch DOES NOT guarantee that the other doesn\u2019t exist.With a regular Merkle tree, the only way to guarantee no other branches intersect is to download them all and check. But that\u2019s no longer a light proof!At the heart of our plasma implementation is a new block structure, and an accompanying new transaction validity condition, which allows us to get light proofs for range-based transactions. The block structure is called a Merkle sum tree, where next to each hash is a sum value.The new validity condition uses the sum values for a particular branch to compute a a start and end range. This calculation is specially crafted so that it is impossible for two branches\u2019 computed ranges to overlap. A transfer is only valid if its own range is within that range, so this gets us back our light clients!This section will specify the exact spec of the sum tree, what the range calculation actually is, and how we actually construct a tree which satisfies the range calculation. For a more detailed background and motivation on the research which led us to this spec, feel free check out this post.We have written two implementations of the plasma Merkle sum tree: one done in a database for the operator, and another in-memory for testing in plasma-utils.Sum Tree Node SpecificationEach node in the Merkle sum tree is 48 bytes, as follows:[32 byte hash][16 byte sum]It\u2019s not a coincidence that the sum\u2019s 16 bytes length is the same as a coinID!We have two helper properties, .hash and .sum, which pull out these two parts. For example, for somenode = 0x1b2e79791f28c27ed669f257397e1deb3e522cf1f27024c161b619d276a25315ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff, we havenode.hash == 0x1b2e79791f28c27ed669f257397e1deb3e522cf1f27024c161b619d276a25315 and node.sum == 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff.Parent CalculationIn a regular Merkle tree, we construct a binary tree of hash nodes, up to a single root node. Specifying the sum tree format is a simple matter of defining the parent(left, right) calculation function which accepts the two siblings as arguments. For example, a regular Merkle sum tree has: parent = function (left, right) { return Sha3(left.concat(right)) } Where Sha3 is the hash function and concat appends the two values together.To create a Merkle sum tree, the parent function must also concatenate the result of an addition operation on its children\u2019s own .sum values:parent = function (left, right) {  return Sha3(left.concat(right)).concat(left.sum + right.sum) }For example, we might haveparent(0xabc\u20260001, 0xdef\u20260002) ===hash(0xabc\u20260001.concat(0xdef\u20260002)).concat(0001 + 0002) ===0x123\u20260003Note that the parent.hash is a commitment to each sibling.sum as well as the hashes: we hash the full 96 bytes of both.Calculating a Branch\u2019s RangeThe reason we use a Merkle sum tree is because it allows us to calculate a specific range which a branch describes, and be 100% confident that no other valid, overlapping branches exist.We calculate this range by adding up a leftSum and rightSum going up the branch. Initializing both to 0, at each parent calculation, if the inclusion proof specifies a sibling to the right, we take rightSum += right.sum, and if to the left, we add leftSum += left.sum.Then, the range the branch describes is [leftSum, root.sum \u2014 rightSum). See the following example:Merkle sum calculation for a branch.In this example, branch 6\u2019s valid range is [21+3, 36\u20135) == [24, 31). Notice that 31\u201324=7, which is the sum value for leaf 6! Similarly, branch 5\u2019s valid range is [21, 36-(7+5)) == [21, 24). Notice that its end is the same as branch 6\u2019s start!If you play around with it, you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s impossible to construct a Merkle sum tree with two different branches covering the same range. At some level of the tree, the sum would have to be broken! Go ahead, try to \u201ctrick\u201d leaf 5 or 6 by making another branch that intersects the range (4.5,6). Filling in only the ?s in grey boxes:You\u2019ll see it\u2019s always impossible at some level of the tree:This is how we get light clients. We call the branch range bounds the implicitStart and implicitEnd, because they are calculated \u201cimplicitly\u201d from the inclusion proof. We have a branch checker implemented in plasma-utils via calculateRootAndBounds() for testing and client-side proof checking:PG Plasma client-side sum tree branch checkeras well as in Vyper for the smart contract viaNote that the ranges are typed starts and ends, the full 16 bytes.Parsing Transfers as LeavesIn a regular Merkle tree, we construct the bottom layer of nodes by hashing the \u201cleaves\u201d:In our case, we want the leaves to be the transactions. So, the hashing is straightforward, but we still need a .sum value for the tree\u2019s bottom level.Given some txA with a single transferA, what should the sum value be? It turns out, not just transferA.end \u2014 transferA.start. The reason for this is that it screws up branches\u2019 ranges if the transfers are not touching. We need to \u201cpad\u201d the sum values to account for this gap, or the root.sum will be too small.Interestingly, this is a non-deterministic choice because you can pad either the node to the right or left of the gap. We\u2019ve chosen the following \u201cleft-aligned\u201d scheme for parsing leaves into blocks:Transfer sum parsingWe call the bottommost .sum value the parsedSum for that branch, and the TransferProof schema includes a .parsedSum value which is used to reconstruct the bottom node.Branch Validity and Implicit NoTxThus, the validity condition for a branch as checked by the smart contract is as follows: implicitStart <= transfer.typedStart < transfer.typedEnd <= implicitEnd . Note that, in the original design of the sum tree in \u201cPlasma Cashflow,\u201d some leaves were filled with a special \u201cNoTx\u201d transaction to represent that ranges were not transacted. With this format, the coins which are not transacted are simply those in the ranges [implicitStart, transfer.typedStart) and [transfer.typedEnd, implicitEnd). The smart contract guarantees that no coins in these ranges can be used in any challenge or response to an exit.Atomic MultisendsOften (to support transaction fees and exchange) transactions require multiple transfers to occur or not, atomically, to be valid. The effect is that a valid transaction needs to be included once for each of its .transfers \u2014 each with a valid sum in relation to that particular transfer.typedStart and .typedEnd. However, for each of these inclusions, it\u2019s still the hash of the full UnsignedTransaction \u2014 NOT the individual Transfer\u2014 that is parsed to the bottom .hash.5. Proof Structure and CheckingUnlike traditional blockchain systems, full plasma nodes don\u2019t store every single transaction, they only ever need to store information relevant to assets they own. This means that the sender has to prove to the recipient that the sender actually owns the given range. A complete proof contains all the information sufficient to guaranteed that, if the Ethereum chain itself does not fork, tokens are redeemable on the main chain.Proofs primarily consist of the inclusion and non-inclusion of transactions, which update the chain of custody for those coins. The inclusion roots must be checked against the block hashes submitted by the operator to the smart contract on the main chain. By tracing the chain of custody as verified in the proof scheme, from a token\u2019s initial deposit into the contract through to the present, ability to redeem is guaranteed.plasma-core follows a relatively simple methodology for verifying incoming transaction proofs. This section describes that methodology.Proof FormatHistory proofs consist of a set of deposit records and long list of relevant Transactions with corresponding TransctionProofs.plasma-utils exposes a static checkTransactionProof(transaction, transactionProof, root) method, which is used by plasma-core here via calls to the ProofService.Transaction ProofsA TransactionProof object contains all the necessary information to check the validity of a given Transaction. Namely, it is simply an array of TransferProof objects. As per the above section on atomic multisends, a given TransactionProof is valid if and only if all its TransferProofs are valid.Transfer ProofsTransferProofs contain all the necessary information required to recover the inclusion of a valid branch corresponding to the given Transfer in the Transaction at the correct block number. This constitutes:The actual nodes of the Merkle sum tree which represent the branch\u2019s full `inclusionProof`The index of the leaf to calculate the binary path traced by the branchThe parsed bottom .sum as described in the sum tree spec aboveThe signature for that particular sender.Right from the plasma-utils schema:Note that the inclusionProof is a variable-length array whose size depends on the depth of the tree.Proof StepsThe core of the verification process involves applying each proof element to the current \u201cverified\u201d state, starting with the deposit. If any proof element doesn\u2019t result in a valid state transition, we must reject the proof.The process for applying each proof element is intuitive; we simply apply the transactions at each block as the contract\u2019s custody rules dictate.Snapshot ObjectsThe way in which we keep track of historically owned ranges is called a snapshot.Quite simply, it represents the verified owner of a range at a block:{  typedStart: Number,  typedEnd: Number,  block: Number,  owner: address}Deposit recordsEvery received range has to come from a corresponding deposit.A deposit record consists of its token, start, end, depositer, and blockNumber.For each deposit record, the verifier must double-check with Ethereum to verify that the claimed deposit did indeed occur, and that no exits have happened in the meantime.If so, a verifiedSnapshots array is initialized to these deposits with each snapshot.owner being the depositer.Next, we apply all given TransactionProofs, updating verifiedSnapshots accordingly. For each transaction and corresponding transactionProof, the verifier performs the following steps:Verify that the given proof element is valid. If not, throw an error.For each transfer in the transaction, do the following: a. \u201cSplit\u201d any snapshots which were updated above at transfer.typedStart, transfer.typedEnd, implicitStart, and implicitEnd b. Increment the .block number for all resulting verifiedSnapshots which have a block equalling transaction.blockNumber \u2014 1 c. For each split snapshot which fell between transfer.start and transfer.end: i. verify that snapshot.owner === transfer.from. If not, throw an error. ii. set snapshot.owner = transfer.sender.The TransactionProofs must be applied in ascending blockNumber.Once this operation has been recursively applied for all TransactionProofs, the client may check for herself which new coins she now owns, by searching for all elements in verifiedSnapshots with a blockNumber equalling the current plasma block, and the owner equalling her address.TransactionProof ValidityThe transaction validity check in step 1. above is equivalent to checking the smart contract\u2019s validity condition. The basic validity check, based on the sum tree specification above, is as follows:1. Check that the transaction encoding is well-formed.2. For each transfer and corresponding transferProof: a. Check that the signature resolves to its transfer.sender address b. verify that the inclusionProof has a root equal to the root hash for that plasma block, with the binary path defined by the leafIndex c. calculate the implicitStart and implicitEnd of the branch, and verify that implicitStart <= transfer.start < transfer.end <= implicitEnd4. Contract and Exit GamesOf course, the proof for a chain of custody isn\u2019t useful unless it can also be passed to the main chain to keep funds secure. The mechanism which accepts proofs on-chain is the core of plasma\u2019s security model, and it is called the \u201cexit game.\u201dWhen a user wants to move their money off a plasma chain, they make an \u201cexit\u201d, which opens a dispute period. At the end of the dispute period, if there are no outstanding disputes, the money is sent from the plasma contract on the main chain to the exiter. During the dispute period, users may submit \u201cchallenges\u201d which claim the money being exited isn\u2019t rightfully owned by the person exiting. The proofs described above guarantee that a \u201cresponse\u201d to these challenges is always calculable.The goal of the exit game is to keep money secured, even in the case of a maximally adversarial operator. Particularly, there are three main attacks which we must mitigate:Data withholding: the operator may publish a root hash to the contract, but not tell anybody what the contents of the block are.Including a forged/invalid transaction: the operator may include a transaction in a block whose sender was not the previous recipient in the chain of custody.Censorship: after someone deposits their money, the operator may refuse to publish any transactions sending the money.In all of these cases, the challenge/response protocol of the exit game makes sure these behaviors do not allow theft, in at most 1 challenge followed by 1 response.Keeping track of deposits and exitsDeposits mappingEach time a new set of coins is deposited, the contract updates a mapping which each contain a deposit struct. From the contract:Note that this struct contains neither the untypedEnd or tokenType for the deposit. That\u2019s because the contract uses those values as the keys in a mapping of mappings. Accessing, for example, accessing the depositer of a given deposit looks like this: someDepositer: address = self.deposits[tokenType][untypedEnd].depositerThis choice saves a little gas, and also makes some of the code cleaner since we don\u2019t need to store any sort of deposit ID to reference a deposit.Exitable ranges mappingIn addition to adding self.deposits entries each time there\u2019s a deposit, the contract needs to somehow keep track of historical exits to prevent multiple exits on the same range. This is a little trickier because exits do not occur in order like deposits, and it would be expensive to search through a list of exits.Our contract implements a constant-sized solution, which instead stores a list of exitable ranges, updating the list as new exits occur. From the smart contract:Again, we use a double-nested mapping with keys tokenType and untypedEnd so that we may call self.exitable[tokenType][untpyedEnd].untypedStart to access the start of the range. Note that Vyper returns 0 for all unset mapping keys, so we need an isSet bool so that users may not \u201ctrick\u201d the contract by passing an unset exitableRange.The contract\u2019s self.exitable ranges are split and deleted based on successful calls to finalizeExit via a helper function called removeFromExitable. Note that exits on a previously exited range do not even need to be challenged; they will never pass the checkRangeExitable test called in finalizeExit. You can find that code here.Exit games\u2019 relationship to vanilla Plasma CashAt heart, the exit games in our spec are very similar to the original Plasma Cash design. Exits are initiated with calls to the functionbeginExit(tokenType: uint256, blockNumber: uint256, untypedStart: uint256, untypedEnd: uint256) -> uint256:To dispute an exit, all challenges specify a particular coinID called into question, and a Plasma Cash-style challenge game is carried out on that particular coin. Just a single coin needs to be proven invalid to cancel the entire exit.Both exits and the two types of respondable challenges are given an exitID and challengeID which are assigned in order via an incrementing challengeNonce and exitNonce.Blocknumber-specified transactionsIn the original Plasma Cash spec, the exiter is required to specify both the exited transaction and its previous \u201cparent\u201d transaction to prevent the \u201cin-flight\u201d attack where the operator delays including a valid transaction and inserts an invalid one in the block between.This poses a problem for our range-based schemes, because a transaction may have multiple parents. For example, if Alice sends (0, 50] to Carol, and Bob sends (50, 100] to Carol, Carol can now send (0, 100] to Dave. But, if Dave wants to exit that, both the (0, 50] and (50, 100] are parents.Though specifying multiple parents is definitely doable, this specification would be gas-expensive and seemed more complex to implement. So, we opted for the simpler alternative, in which each transaction specifies the `block` its senders intend for it to go in and is invalidated if included in a different block. This solves the in-flight attack and means the contract does not need a transaction\u2019s parents. For those interested in a formal writeup and safety proof for this scheme, it\u2019s worth giving this great post a look.Per-coin transaction validityAn unintuitive property of our exit games worth noting up front is that a certain transaction might be \u201cvalid\u201d for some of the coins in its range, but not on others.For example, imagine that Alice sends (0, 100] to Bob, who in turn sends (50, 100] to Carol. Carol does not need to verify that Alice was the rightful owner of the full (0, 100]. Carol only needs an assurance that Alice owned (50, 100] \u2014 the part of the custody chain which applies to her receipt. Though the transaction might in a sense be \u201cinvalid\u201d if Alice didn\u2019t own (0, 50], the smart contract does not care about that for the purposes of disputes around exits for the coins (50, 100]. So long as the received coins\u2019 ownership is verified, the rest of the transactions don\u2019t matter.This is a very important requirement to preserve the size of light client proofs. If Carol had to check the full (0, 100], she might also have to check an overlapping parent of (0, 10000], and then all of its parents, and so on. This \u201ccascading\u201d effect could massively increase the size of proofs if transactions were very interdependent.Note that this property also applies to atomic multisends which describe multiple ranges being swapped. If Alice trades 1 ETH for Bob\u2019s 1 DAI, it is Alice\u2019s responsibility to check that Bob owns the 1 Dai before signing. However, after, if Bob then sends the 1 ETH to Carol, Carol need not verify that Bob owned the 1 DAI, only that Alice owned the 1 ETH she sent to Bob. Alice incurred the risk, so Carol doesn\u2019t have to.From the standpoint of the smart contract, this property is a direct consequence of challenges always being submitted for a particular coinID within the exit.How the contract handles transaction checkingNote that, to be used in exit games at all, Transactions must pass the TransactionProof check described in the proofs section above(valid signatures, branch bounds, etc). This check is performed at the contract level in the functiondef checkTransactionProofAndGetTypedTransfer(   transactionEncoding: bytes[277],   transactionProofEncoding: bytes[1749],   transferIndex: int128 ) -> (   address, # transfer.to   address, # transfer.from   uint256, # transfer.start (typed)   uint256, # transfer.end (typed)   uint256 # transaction plasmaBlockNumber ):An important note here is the transferIndex argument. Remember, a transaction may contain multiple transfers, and must be included once in the tree for each transfer. However, since challenges refer to a specific coinID, only a single transfer will be relevant. So, challengers and responders gives a transferIndex \u2014 whichever of the transfers relates to the coin being disputed. The check decodes and checks all the TransferProofs in the TransactionProof, and then checks inclusion for each with the functiondef checkTransferProofAndGetTypedBounds( leafHash: bytes32, blockNum: uint256, transferProof: bytes[1749]) -> (uint256, uint256): # typedimplicitstart, typedimplicitEndOnce all TransferProofs are verified, the dispute-relevant values for the transferIndexth Transfer are returned to the exit game functions: namely the sender, recipient, typedStart, typedEnd, and plasmaBlockNumber.With that out of the way, we can specify the full set of challenge/response games for exits.Challenges which immediately cancel exitsTwo kinds of challenges immediately cancel exits: those on spent coins and those on exits before the deposit occurred.Spent coin challengeThis challenge is used to demonstrate that the exiter of a transaction already sent the coins to someone else.@publicdef challengeSpentCoin( exitID: uint256, coinID: uint256, transferIndex: int128, transactionEncoding: bytes[277], transactionProofEncoding: bytes[1749],):It uses checkTransactionProofAndGetTypedTransfer and then checks the following:The challenged coinID lies within the specified exit.The challenged coinID lies within the typedStart and typedEnd of the transferIndexth element of transaction.transfers.The plasmaBlockNumber of the challenge is greater than that of the exit.The transfer.sender is the exiter.The introduction of atomic swaps does mean one thing: the spent coin challenge period must be strictly less than others, because of an edge case in which the operator withholds an atomic swap between two or more parties. In this case, those parties must exit their pre-swapped coins, forcing the operator to make a a spent coin challenge and reveal whether the swap was included or not. BUT, if we allowed the operator to do that at the last minute, it would make for be a race condition where the parties have no time to use the reveal to cancel other exits. Thus, the timeout is made shorter (1/2) than the regular challenge window, eliminating \u201clast-minute response\u201d attacks.Before deposit challengeThis challenge is used to demonstrate that an exit comes from an earlier plasmaBlockNumber than that coin was actually deposited for.@publicdef challengeBeforeDeposit( exitID: uint256, coinID: uint256, depositUntypedEnd: uint256):The contract looks up self.deposits[self.exits[exitID].tokenType][depositUntypedEnd].precedingPlasmaBlockNumber and checks that it is later than the exit\u2019s block number. If so, it cancels.Optimistic exits and inclusion challengesOur contract allows an exit to occur without doing any inclusion checks at all in the optimistic case. To allow this, any exit may be challenged directly via@publicdef challengeInclusion(exitID: uint256):To which the exiter must directly respond with either the transaction or deposit they are exiting from.@publicdef respondTransactionInclusion( challengeID: uint256, transferIndex: int128, transactionEncoding: bytes[277], transactionProofEncoding: bytes[1749],):...@publicdef respondDepositInclusion( challengeID: uint256, depositEnd: uint256):The second case allows users to get their money out if the operator censored all transactions after depositing.Both responses cancel the challenge if:The deposit or transaction was indeed at the exit\u2019s plasma block number.The depositer or recipient is indeed the exiter.The start and end of the exit were within the deposit or transfer\u2019s start and endInvalid History ChallengesThe most complex challenge-response game, for both vanilla Plasma Cash and this spec, is the case of history invalidity. This part of the protocol mitigates the attack in which the operator includes an forged \u201cinvalid\u201d transaction whose sender is not the previous recipient. The solution is called an invalid history challenge: because the rightful owner has not yet spent their coins, they attest to this and challenge: \u201coh yeah, that coin is yours? Well it was mine earlier, and you can\u2019t prove I ever spent it.\u201dBoth invalid history challenges and responses can be either deposits or transactions.ChallengingThere are two ways to challenge depending on the current rightful owner:@publicdef challengeInvalidHistoryWithTransaction( exitID: uint256, coinID: uint256, transferIndex: int128, transactionEncoding: bytes[277], transactionProofEncoding: bytes[1749]):and@publicdef challengeInvalidHistoryWithDeposit( exitID: uint256, coinID: uint256, depositUntypedEnd: uint256):These both call a@privatedef challengeInvalidHistory( exitID: uint256, coinID: uint256, claimant: address, typedStart: uint256, typedEnd: uint256, blockNumber: uint256):function which does the legwork of checking that the coinID is within the challenged exit, and that the blockNumber is earlier than the exit.Responding to invalid history challengesOf course, the invalid history challenge may be a grief, where really the challenger did spend their coin, and the chain of custody is indeed valid. We must allow this response. There are two kinds.The first is to respond with a transaction showing the challenger\u2019s spend:@publicdef respondInvalidHistoryTransaction( challengeID: uint256, transferIndex: int128, transactionEncoding: bytes[277], transactionProofEncoding: bytes[1749],):The smart contract then performs the following checks:The transferIndexth Transfer in the transactionEncoding covers the challenged coinID.The transferIndexth transfer.sender was indeed the claimant for that invalid history challenge.The transaction\u2019s plasma block number lies between the invalid history challenge and the exit.The other response is to show the challenge came before the coins were actually deposited \u2014 making the challenge invalid. This is similar to the challengeBeforeDeposit for exits themselves.@publicdef respondInvalidHistoryDeposit( challengeID: uint256, depositUntypedEnd: uint256):In this case, there is no check on the sender being the challenge recipient, since the challenge was invalid. So the contract must simply check:The deposit covers the challenged coinID.The deposit\u2019s plasma block number lies between the challenge and the exit.If so, the exit is cancelled.This concludes the complete exit game specification. With these building blocks, funds can be kept safe even in the case of a maximally malicious plasma chain.6. The FuturePlasma Group is dedicated to the creation of an open plasma implementation for the greater Ethereum community. It\u2019s our mission to push layer 2 scaling forward by exploring the full potential of the plasma framework. There\u2019s certinaly much more to push forward! Here are some of the things we hope to work on next.Missing pieces in implementationAutomated GuardingWhile a good start, many improvements are needed to fulfill the true potential of Plasma, for this spec and beyond. Currently, the most glaring missing piece in our implementation is guarding, the automated process which submits challenges and responses on behalf of users. Thankfully, the exit games themselves are implemented and have been manually tested, so that client software can be updated after a chain is deployed. We felt this was sufficient for a testnet release, but is the most pressing addition the code needs.P2P History ProofsCurrently, when a user recieves a transaction, they ask the operator and re-download the full proof. This introduces a massive increase in operator overhead. What should really happen is that the sender directly transmits their locally stored proof to the recipient, bypassing the operator and making it much cheaper to run a plasma chain.Defragmentation StrategiesSince we support atomic swaps, our current spec is compatible with any defragmentation strategy without any upgrades to the contract. However, it remains to be seen what the right approach will be, especially since we require transactions to specify a Plasma block number. We hope the plasma community can build an extensible defragmentation abstraction library which allows operators and users to try out different approaches.Front-end wallet integrationWe have some designs for a front-end wallet, but currently the client only supports command-line transacting, with no support for trading different ERC20s. Having a nice UI to give to testnet users will be a major step up in terms of UX and accessibility.Operator feesBecause we support atomic multisends, we can support transaction fees without any protocol modifications. However, we\u2019ve not currently implemented anything for this testnet launch.Networked operatorSomething we\u2019re not taking advantage of yet is that merkle tree construction is highly parallelizable. If the operator was deployed as a networked cluster, we could increase block size by constructing subtrees in parallel.Raspberry plasma, anyone?Code reviewIt\u2019s very likely that all of the client, contract, and operator implementations have critical bugs at this time. We\u2019re hoping that part of this public launch will be an opportunity for external contributors to help point out many mistakes!Missing pieces in the specSuccinct Proof SchemesAs mentioned in the introduction, the most active area of Plasma research is a scheme to reduce the history proof size. P2P or not, an old (say, 1 year+) coin might have a significant amount of associated proof data, making transactions cumbersome. This is because the history proof contains, at minimum, one branch per block.RSA accumulator constructions and STARKS/SNARKS which batch branch proofs over many blocks are currently the most likely candidates. Both would require protocol changes: for RSA (which also introduces a trusted setup), an entirely new validity condition must be added to the exit game. For the latter, the tree needs to be constructed using a SNARK/STARK friendly hashing algorithm, which has not been implemented in EVM.Mass Exit/Deposit SchemesIf the operator does turn malicious, users must (eventually, no rush!) exit their funds. The concept of \u201cmass exits\u201d, in which many users consent to exiting together via a single on-chain transaction, would be a significant scalability increase. Ideally, the exit would be able to auto-deposit funds directly into a different plasma chain via a merkle root of balances. This would enable many users to switch chains, without individual balances ever being resolved on the main chain \u2014 a significant improvement in the \u201cnetworkability\u201d of multiple plasma chains.Multi-operator networksThough the operator cannot steal funds, they can censor transactions at will. One mitigation to this would be to replace the single-operator model with a set of operators, so that the existence of just a single honest operator is sufficient for clients to transact.Improved exit recordsOur exitable range construction allows for constant-sized checks on exited ranges. However, since each finalization updates this mapping, we will have a race condition if exits on the same range aren\u2019t processed in ascending order. This is because the first exit\u2019s finalization splits the range, changing the key to the self.exitable mapping and causing checkRangeExitable to fail for exits referencing the unsplit range. Those exits will revert and have to be re-submitted in the next Ethereum block. A gas-efficient alternative may exist, possibly using some sort of tree, queue, or some batchFinalizeExits method.State channels and scriptingRecently, there\u2019s been some great progress in the research community which suggests state channels and scripting with covenants are feasible on Plasma. Our current spec does not support either of these features, and will require a significant upgrade to the smart contract to support.Together, we\u2019ll build towards realizing the vision of a more decentralized future.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Plasma", "Ethereum Blockchain", "Ethereum"]}, {"title": "Reserve Protocol:

JozsefFollowJul 10, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readI\u2019ve fallen back a lot on my Vyper series. There are actually more than one reasons, including mental health, life management, relationships, work, schoolwork\u2026 But really, the part that will be interesting to you, the readers who have been waiting for the type system article for a quarter of a year, is the part about Vyper itself, and about Ethereum.Let\u2019s start with the Ethereum part, which is exciting but bad news. I\u2019ll cover the Vyper part, which is good news, in the actual next installment of the tutorial, which is actually coming soon.The great gas crisis of EthereumSo you might have heard of Gastoken. It has sent the Ethereum community into an uproar. While \u201ctokenizing gas\u201d sounds quite harmless at first, when you examine what it actually does, it will definitely start looking a lot more diabolical.The EVM has a relatively new feature that was meant to incentivize releasing unused Storage, and thus reduce the size of State. When you release Storage (by setting it to zero), you get some gas refunded. Enter gascoin. Gascoin is minted by spamming State with useless data, thus \u201cdeep freezing\u201d the gas paid for the operation \u2014 later, by setting these fields back to zero, users can thaw the gas. Well\u2026 you can guess whether the gas refund feature has thus made State smaller\u2026 or bigger.So\u2026 Enter the Ethereum developer community, and a revolutionary proposal to deal with Gastoken once and for all: rent, aka pay-to-stay. In the indefinite future, all Ethereum contracts will require regular rent payments, and contracts that fall behind on their rent will be evicted from State.Now, to ensure that value isn\u2019t destroyed by eviction, interested parties will be able to resuscitate evicted contracts by paying a fee. Now the deep specifics of this is not entirely worked out yet as far as I understand, I\u2019m pretty sure that resuscitating a contract with megabytes in Storage (ie. any sufficiently popular ERC20 token) will cost a pretty penny.So\u2026 this pretty much means that current Ethereum development practice, based on central registry contracts, is dead. ERC20 is dead. ENS is dead. Cryptokitties are\u2026 actually no, Cryptokitties aren\u2019t dead.Corporate, privately owned central registries, with a clear offchain owner who gets a cut of the money flowing through their DApp can of course keep working, as the owner will be able to take some of their profits, and pay the rent from it. It\u2019s decentralized, unowned registries, you know the kind that Ethereum was built to create, that will have issues.A question raised on Ethresear.ch was, after I argued the point above, was what technical shortcomings central registries have, beyond the rent issue. Well, the rent issue is the issue. Or rather, it\u2019s similar to CO2 emission taxes \u2014 it\u2019s not emission taxes that make hydrocarbon fuels unsustainable, it\u2019s global warming. Emission taxes are only a measure attempting to limit the issue.Central registry contracts are unsustainable because they rely on free access to a very limited resource \u2014 Ethereum State size \u2014 that is currently subsidized in an unsustainable way. Just leaving everything as it is is no longer an option. Not after Gascoin.You\u2019re in Limbo, you just don\u2019t know itNow, while I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll come up with something to make sure the existing wealth that is tracked by Ethereum doesn\u2019t become unacessible, what this means is that any decentralized token, any truly decentralized contract that contains an address registry recording ownership, is pretty much a dead man walking.There IS a fix to save ERC20 (the interface, not the implementation), and in general the ability of Ethereum to do all the stuff we took for granted. Vitalik mentioned it in the Ethresear.ch thread linked above \u2014 a stateless central contract, and independent child contracts for each individual owner. With a central provenance check mechanism, this actually is viable!Too bad you cannot use it yet. You see, for this to really, nicely, seamlessly work, we\u2019ll need CREATE2. An EVM opcode that will allow the creation of child contracts with a custom nonce, as opposed to the TxCount of the parent. Thus, the creation nonce could be derived from the owner\u2019s address, making for a star schema of contracts implementing a \u201cmapping\u201d. The central, stateless contract can still expose the ERC20 interface, and users can still use it as they expect it to work.And CREATE2 doesn\u2019t exist yet. Now you can still build tokens that use a similar multi-contract structure, only one that uses random child contract addresses, and results in a UTXO-like user experience\u2026 But this isn\u2019t all that pretty either, as the EVM currently offers no access to a contract\u2019s own TxCount (which means additional Storage writes for keeping track, and an additional point of failure). Also, provenance checking in a contract is less than comfortable at the moment (maybe I\u2019ll do a separate article on that). For those curious, this is how you do it in Solidity, to my best knowledge:function childAddress(uint256 _nonce) public view returns (address){  //if(_nonce == 0x00) return address(keccak256(byte(0xd6), byte(0x94), address(this), byte(0x80))); // no 0 nonce on contracts  if(_nonce <= 0x7f) return address(keccak256(byte(0xd6), byte(0x94), address(this), byte(_nonce)));  if(_nonce <= 0xff) return address(keccak256(byte(0xd7), byte(0x94), address(this), byte(0x81), uint8(_nonce)));  if(_nonce <= 0xffff) return address(keccak256(byte(0xd8), byte(0x94), address(this), byte(0x82), uint16(_nonce)));  if(_nonce <= 0xffffff) return address(keccak256(byte(0xd9), byte(0x94), address(this), byte(0x83), uint24(_nonce)));  if(_nonce <= 0xffffffff) return address(keccak256(byte(0xda), byte(0x94), address(this), byte(0x84), uint32(_nonce)));  revert(); // more than 2^32 nonces not realistic}So any contract you write with currently workable practices is unsustainable. Practices that would result in sustainable contracts are either unworkable or extremely uncomfortable (for the user too, not just for the developer). You\u2019re in limbo, you just didn\u2019t realize it yet.Well now you know.So what?I dunno. Lobby your local representative for the inclusion of CREATE2 in the next hardfork. It\u2019s pretty bad as it looks in my opinion, and people\u2019s total indifference in the face of impending doom is quite similar to how oil conglomerates treat global warming.We\u2019ll see. I think pay-to-stay, CREATE2, and a good, reliable and cheap way to do provenance checks will make Ethereum much better and more sustainable, and Ethereum contracts much prettier from an engineering standpoint. But that needs all of this implemented, and that doesn\u2019t change that none of this is implemented, and that doom is coming to Sarnath whether pay-to-stay becomes reality or not.ps. This is not an \u201cEthereum is dead, long live EOS / NEO / fuckcoin / whatever else\u201d shitpost. I\u2019m invested in Ethereum, both financially and personally. I love the vibrant dev community, the ethos of decentralization, the intellectual depth of development discussions. I\u2019m sure Ethereum will not only survive, but thrive. Great things are on the way. That said, there will be bumps along the road.

The implementation follows Lendroid\u2019s whitepaper, and some component properties have been added or updated for practical purposes. The source code is available on Github.Driven by designWriting smart contracts for crypto lending is as challenging as it is exciting. On the one hand, there are the functionalities that must be served by the contract. And on the other, the security of the smart contract. Then there is the third and arguably fundamental dimension of usability \u2014 how simple the contract is, how light, how economical when it comes to gas cost.Lendroid\u2019s design philosophy was informed by these challenges and can be explained in the following manner -Architect loosely-coupled smart contracts, where each contract is written to perform it\u2019s core functionality perfectly, and interaction of all the contracts resulted in realizing crypto lending. The functionality of each contract is limited to a maximum of two core functions, and cross-contract interaction is implemented via a registry contract.In effect, this design philosophy does three things -Makes the smart contract completely efficient in what it sets out to do.Keeps each of the smart contracts lightMakes cross-contract calls seamless and, more importantly, secure.Needless to say, each contract plays a very important role in the Lendroid Smart Contract ecosystem.Here are some instances -The Kernel contract is important in handling wholly and partially filled loan kernels.The SimpleWrangler contract validates a loan approval (signed from Wrangler server) to create a crypto loan.SimpleLoan contract is necessary to represent a loan position backed by the underlying collateral.Positions contract queries the ecosystem regarding lent and borrowed positions.The Lazarus contract was implemented to handle re-usable SimpleLoan contract for new loans.TokenTransferProxy contract is essential to facilitating token transfers across the contracts and protocol players.The Registry contract was central in storing and retrieving information about all contracts in the ecosystem. This is what makes cross-contract calls seamless.WorkflowHere\u2019s the broad workflow, with some additional detail to navigate unfamiliar components -Lendroid Protocol Smart Contract System design (Solidity)Kernel creation: A loan kernel / order is created, by either a lender or a borrower. If created by lender, it becomes a lend order. If a borrower creates the order, it\u2019s a borrow order. The kernel comprises the following components:lender: lender\u2019s ETH address if created by lender, else ZERO_ADDRESSborrower: borrower ETH address if created by borrower, else ZERO_ADDRESSloanTokenAddress: ETH address of token given as loancollateralTokenAddress: ETH address of token needed as collateralloanTokenAmountOffered: wei_value of loan token that would completely fill this kernel. Partial fills are possibleinterestRatePerDay: positive decimal valueloanDuration: seconds indicating how long a loan (created from wholly / partially filling this kernel) is validrelayerFee: Fee (in LST) paid to relayer for helping fill the corresponding kernelmonitoringFee : Fee (LST) paid to wrangler to ensure the loan is not defaultedrolloverFee : Fee (LST) paid to wrangler to roll the loan over / extend the loanclosureFee : Fee (LST) paid to borrower to clean up the loan contract, so it can be re-used for another loan.Off-chain storage: The loan kernel is saved to a central server, which then broadcasts it to relayersRelayer: On the relayer UI, a filler fills the kernel and sends it to the wrangler as a loan requestWrangler: A protocol keeper that approves and monitors loans. If the wrangler rejects the loan, he sends an error message which is displayed on the relayer UI.Otherwise, the wrangler appends a nonce to the request, signs the request, and then sends an approval object comprisingSignature,Loan amount filled,Kernel (loan terms in it), andNonceThis approval is then displayed on the relayer UI for the filler to confirm. After confirmation, it is sent to the protocol smart contracts.It first enters Kernel.sol smart contract via the fill() functionLoan approvalKernel.sol.fill(): Takes as input the wrangler\u2019s approval and validates the kernel object (that the creator is in fact the one that created the kernel object). It then sends the approval to SimpleWrangler.solSimpleWrangler.sol.create(): Takes as input the wrangler\u2019s approval and validates his signature (i.e., the correctness of the nonce and the wrangler\u2019s signature). Upon correct validation, a loan contract is created as Loan.sol. Fees as described in the kernel are paid to the Relayer and the Wrangler. The collateral is transferred to the Loan.sol contract. The loan amount is transferred to the borrower.Loan closure: Borrower closes the Loan by repaying the loanAmountOwed to the Lender. The Borrower\u2019s collateral is transferred back to his ETH address.The Solidity Smart ContractsLow-level contractsThe following are the base contracts whose logic is not likely to change during the evolution of the Lendroid Protocol.Registry.solStores and retrieves addresses of the lower-level protocol contracts. It contains the following functions:setTokenTransferProxy()Sets the address of the TokenTransferProxy contractgetTokenTransferProxy()Returns the TokenTransferProxy contract. The callee can then directly call the functions from the returned value.setPosition()Sets the address of the Position contractgetPosition()Returns the Position contract. The callee can then directly call the functions from the returned value.setKernel()Sets the address of the Kernel contractgetKernel()Returns the Kernel contract. The callee can then directly call the functions from the returned value.setLazarus()Sets the address of the Lazarus contract (which saves Loan contracts for reuse)getLazarus()Returns the Lazarus contract. The callee can then directly call the functions from the returned value.TokenTransferProxy.solInspired from 0xProject, all token allowances and transfers to and from the protocol are handled by this contract. This contract transfers tokens on behalf of all the contracts. It comprises the following functions:transferFrom()Calls into ERC20 Token contract, invoking transferFrom.Position.solMaintains a list of all lend and borrow positions per address. It consists of the following functions:recordLoan()Record a position whenever a loan is created. Lend position in created for lender, and Borrow position for borrowergetLoanCounts()Returns the number of lend and borrow positions for a given addressKernel.solExclusive to Kernel-related functionality. Handles kernel-fills and kernel-cancels. It consists of the following functions:fill()This is the entry point of the Loan creation process. This function is called by the relayer once wrangler approves a loan request.cancel()Sometimes, the kernel creator would want to cancel an unfilled / partially filled loan kernel. This function also helps to cancel a loan kernel created by mistake. This is an on-chain call, even though the kernel creation happens off-chain.getFilledOrCancelledLoanAmount()Helper function to determine the loanAmount of loanToken left in a previously created loan kernel.computeOfferHashFromFillInputs()Internal function that returns the kernel hash computed from inputs sent to fill(). Called by only the fill() function. This function was necessary to due to the Stack Too Deep issue.computeOfferHash()Internal function that computes and returns the kernel hash from inputs that make up the kernel object. Called by computeOfferHashFromFillInputs() and cancel() functions.Lazarus.solSaves Loan contracts for reuse, once they have been closed. This technique helps to recycle used contracts so they do not stagnate the Ethereum blockchain forever. This contracts consists of the following functions:addChild()Add a contract as a child. It\u2019s important that the caller is the owner of the contract. After calling this function, the caller should transfer the ownership of the child to LazarusreleaseChild()Release the last child and transfer it\u2019s ownership to the caller. Returns an array of [true, child address] is successful.cleanLastChild()Remove the last child if it\u2019s owner is not Lazarus. This is useful to clean up maliciously added contracts (since the addChild is a public function which can be called by anyone!)High-level contractsThe following contracts are likely to evolve over different versions of the Lendroid Protocol.SimpleWrangler.solCreates, stores info about, and manages loans approved by the wrangler. It comprises of the following functions:create()This function is called by the Kernel.sol contract (specifically, from Kernel.fill()). This function takes as input the wrangler\u2019s approval and validates his signature (i.e., the correctness of the nonce and the wrangler\u2019s signature). Upon correct validation, either a new loan contract or an existing cleaned loan contract is reused, depending on whether a cleaned contract is available or not upon calling Lazarus.releaseChild() function. The Loan.init() method is then called to populate the contract with the loan terms. Fees as described in the kernel are then paid to the Relayer and the Wrangler. The collateral is transferred to the Loan.sol contract. The loan is transferred to the borrower.releaseContract()Transfer ownership of given loanAddress to Lazarus. This is called by the Borrower once a loan is closed. This function resets all parameters of the loan contract, and transfers its ownership to the Lazarus contract.SimpleLoan.solThe Loan contract containing loan terms between the lender and the borrower. All loan-related functions are performed by calling the following functions on this contract.init()Called by SimpleWrangler contract (specifically SimpleWrangler.create()). The loan terms are set as the contract parameters. Fees as described in the kernel are then paid to the Relayer and the Wrangler. The collateralAmount of the collateralToken is transferred to the Loancontract. The loanAmount of loanToken is transferred to the borrower.computeHash()Returns a hash of loan terms defined in the contract.transferCollateralToken()Internal function to transfer the collateral from the contract to the intended recipient. Used by close() and liquidate() functions.close()Borrower closes the Loan by repaying the loanAmountOwed to the Lender. The Borrower\u2019s collateral is transferred back to his ETH address.liquidate()Called by Wrangler if the borrower defaults his payments. In v1, we also allow lender to call this function if the loan expires and still has not been repaid.topUp()Borrower sends some more collateralToken to the Loan contract if the value of the collateral backing the loan decreases below the margin value due to market fluctuationclean()Called by SimpleWrangler contract (specifically SimpleWrangler.releaseContract()). This function resets all the parameters to their default values, and the contract\u2019s ownership is transferred to Lazarus. This makes the contract available for reuse. The borrower is then sent the closeFee in LST.renounceOwnership()This makes it impossible to transfer a Loan contract to a ZERO_ADDRESS, thus making it necessary to always have an owner.In conclusion \u2026The information above was intended to provide a comprehensive overview of our design philosophy while architecting our smart contracts.

Programming languages are designed to be fast to run, or easy to learn, or quick to write, or for lots of other reasons. One language can\u2019t do all those things well, so language designers make trade-offs. They may make a language fast but hard to read, or concise but hard to maintain. These goals and trade-offs are well understood and haven\u2019t really changed for decades.Until now.Now Vyper has given up a bunch of features in the pursuit of a new goal: to make it hard to lie.Vyper is designed for smart contracts which are\u2026 well\u2026 weird. We all know normal contracts, they\u2019re legal documents that outline the terms of a relationship. They\u2019re written, interpreted and debated by lawyers, judges and the legal system. \u201cSmart\u201d contracts are contracts that are written as computer programs and executed automatically on a blockchain. Smart contracts are a really exciting development and could be the start of a brand new era. Imagine a world without lawyers where the terms of a contract are defined, enforced and run as code. There is no interpretation or debate, just pure abstract unbiased code.Source: https://medium.com/@fabiojose/build-a-smart-contract-to-sell-goods-6cf73609d25But here\u2019s the problem: What if a smart contract has a loophole in the code? Or a bug?Well\u2026 you lose all your money and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.Without lawyers and courts and judges there\u2019s no debate, no recourse. It doesn\u2019t matter what the program was intended to do, it only matters what the program actually does. The program runs, you lose your money. End of story. This isn\u2019t theoretical, it has already happened. Like the time someone found a bug in an Etherium smart contract and stole $55 million dollars and was nothing happened to them.What makes this problem really bad is that writing tricky, buggy and misleading code isn\u2019t hard. In fact it\u2019s easy. In fact it\u2019s so easy that inexperienced software developers do it by accident all the time. Writing tricky buggy code is the default. Professional software developers spend most of their lives desperately fighting to write code that\u2019s easy to understand.Sometimes just for laughs developers will write hard to read code on purpose. Here is a flight simulator written in a way that\u2019s almost impossible for a person to read, and shaped like a plane just for fun.It\u2019s a flight simulator written to look like a plane http://blog.aerojockey.com/post/iocccsimSo what happens when someone hands you a smart contract shaped like a plane? What if you read the code and are \u201cpretty sure\u201d it\u2019s a plane? How sure do you have to be? Remember, if you\u2019re wrong, or miss a subtle loophole, you lose all your money with no recourse.Will Vyper make sure that if the code looks like a plane, it is a plane? Can it solve this core issue in smart contracts?In the end, like everything in the wild weird world of crypto currencies, Vyper and smart contracts leave me with so many mind blowing questions. In 20 years, will lawyers be replaced by programmers for at least some things? If smart contracts replace normal contracts, will lawyers learn to code? Or will we hire specialist programmers to review smart contracts? Will programmer lawyers try to trick each other with loophole filled smart contracts? Or will smart contracts find a new niche and not replace normal contracts at all? Could Vyper be the first loophole proof programming language?Regardless of what the future holds, I just love it when weird new things happen in technology, and I can\u2019t wait to see what happens.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Ethereum", "Smart Contracts", "Programming"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@nugamak/https-guarium-bounty-nu-5325-3975862-1520a856b469?source=search_post", "author_name": "AirDrop & Bounty", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@nugamak", "publish_date": "2018-08-03", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-03", "readtime": "0.30", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "AirDrop & BountyFollowAug 3, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readhttps://guarium.bounty.nu/5325/3975862\ud83d\udd25GUARIUM AIRDROPNOT\u00c9 4.1/5 SUR ICOBENCH50\u201330000 GUAR (60$ \u2014 36000$)\ud83d\udd39\ufe0fAirdrop sous vyper avec plusieurs taches twitter, facebookhttps://t.me/airdrop_lux#airdrop #bounty #ico #\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044e\u0442\u0430 #\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043a\u0435\u043d\u044b #freetokens #crypto #cryptocurrency", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/yacine-airdrop/brickexio-bounty-contest-f85fcc0cdc9f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Yacine Ajana", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ajanayacine77", "publish_date": "2018-09-26", "last_modified_date": "2018-09-26", "readtime": "0.12", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Yacine AjanaFollowSep 26, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readbrickexio bounty contesthttps://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/vyper-assets/logo.b5cd7271904cbbdlogo22945.jpgYacine Ajana \u2014 MediumRead writing from Yacine Ajana on Medium.

Government is the tangible apparatus that legitimizes and executes laws. Governance is the means through which a government distributes its legitimization and execution across laws. Generalized governance (GG) is the set of rules all types of governance mechanisms follow. In other words, GG is all that can be abstracted from all forms of governance. In programming lingo, GG is a class, and things like democracy, republic, TCRs, etc. are instances of that class.Why do we want GG?GG is useful for the same reason every Ethereum Request for Comment (e.g. ERC-20, ERC-721) is useful: Ease of interoperability is directly proportional with achieved network effects. When aspects of commonly used notions (e.g. what constitutes a token, what constitutes packets of information sent across the internet, what constitutes governance) are standardized and agreed upon, developers can concentrate on the core competencies of their products and thus augment the network\u2019s cumulative value (e.g. the nuances of TCP/IP minimally distract the front-end developer from providing their users with the best UX).What makes my GG so special?Past GG designs have assumed tokenomics-based solutions to governance (e.g. this GG paradigm is tokenomics-specific and this other GG paradigm, by Level K, is again tokenomics-specific but opinionated to easily accommodate TCRs), but clearly there are many instances of governance that don\u2019t need any tokenomics (e.g. despotism, direct democracy, and systems that cannot be implemented with tokenomics). Therefore, past solutions do not fully encapsulate the set of all governance solutions and thus are not truly GG solutions.I have formulated an alternative interface that I now propose as a true GG solution. This solution allows for data type-agnostic decisions and captures the governance instances born from tokenomics as well as the traditional solutions pictured above. I have also made and tested a basic, exemplary implementation of said interface. In this post, I\u2019ll be diving deep into how my interface operates through examining my basic implementation.How does my GG work?To explain how my GG works, I\u2019ll first list excerpts from the relevant code that can be referenced as the \u201clegal workflow\u201d is outlined. Then, I\u2019ll actually walk through said outline.Below are excerpts from interfaces/governance.vy, the interface for my GG:@publicaddPreferences(_dud: address, _type: uint256, _prefs: address) -> bool@publicaddIssue(_dud: address, _type: uint256) -> uint256@publicpropose(_dud: address, _type: uint256, _issue: uint256) -> uint256@publicdebate(_dud: address, _bill: uint256) -> uint256@publicvote(_dud: address, _debate: uint256, _votes: uint256, _ye: bool) -> uint256@publicresolve(_debate: uint256) -> bool@constant@publicnumIssues() -> uint256@constant@publicnumBills() -> uint256@constant@publicnumDebates() -> uint256These excerpts allude to the general workflow for \u201chow a bill becomes a law\u201d in my GG.Additionally, here is an excerpt from contracts/preferences_basic_address.vy, a necessary feature of the governance process:inDebate: public(bool)owner: public(address)delegation: public(address)opinions: map(uint256, address) # HERE@publicdef __init__(_owner: address):    self.owner = _owner@publicdef isInDebate(_status: bool) -> bool:    assert msg.sender == self.delegation    self.inDebate = _status    return _status@publicdef setDelegation(_gov: address) -> bool:    assert self.owner == msg.sender    assert not self.inDebate    self.delegation = _gov    return True@publicdef setOpinion(_issue: uint256, _opinion: address) -> bool: # HERE    assert self.owner == msg.sender    assert not self.inDebate    self.opinions[_issue] = _opinion    return True@public@constantdef getOpinion(_issue: uint256) -> address: # HERE    return self.opinions[_issue]In preferences contracts, user can input their opinion for various issues. Those opinions may become law. The excerpt above is taken from the preferences contract handling the address data type. Only 3 lines of code need to be altered to build preferences contracts listing opinions for different data types, and within those lines, only one word needs to be changed. The lines that need to be altered have been commented with # HERE in the excerpt above. If the governance system is to reach decisions regarding string[100] variables instead of address variables, then, within those 3 lines, simply replace address with string[100]. That\u2019s it. My repo provides examples of preferences contracts for uint256, string[100], address, and timedelta data types, so check it out if examples can explain this point better than I.With the necessary infrastructure in place, we can now dive into the \u201clegal workflow.\u201d The workflow that follows is how I thought about the GG process, but the governance interface, I think, accommodates a plethora of alternative and valid workflows. Those other workflows may not even include preferences contracts! That being said, here is my envisioned workflow:Future members deploy preferences contracts for every data type of decision.Future members set their preferences i.e. their opinions are recorded and setOpinion() is called.The GG contract is deployedMembers are \u201cadded\u201d i.e. Members must call setDelegation() to assign the GG contract as their preferences\u2019 delegation, addPreferences() is called to link their preferences with their address the GG contract, and some other operation may be invoked within GG (e.g. reputation points may be assigned to the member\u2019s address or some access token may be assigned to them).5. Members call propose() to propose that their opinion on an issue becomes law.6. Debates on proposed bills are initiated by calling debate().7. Votes follow via calling vote().8. A debate is resolved by calling resolve().9. The governing body\u2019s legitimization of an opinion is asserted; A bill becomes a law. The actual read operation of laws involves reading the approved bill\u2019s sponsor\u2019s preferences and then reading the sponsor\u2019s opinion.A locking operation can be applied to the preferences contract such that when one\u2019s opinion becomes law, then they cannot change their opinion on an issue. The basic implementation on my repo works differently in that it allows those whose opinions have been deemed as law to change their opinions and thus the law. This is akin to selecting \u201can expert\u201d per issue governed, where the governing body defaults to the expertise of a subset of members. I say \u201csubset\u201d because a preferences contract\u2019s opinions can easily be governed by another governing body of individuals, another GG contract, or even the same GG contract with opinionated functionality for whitelisted committees.ConclusionThe contract in my repo has a basic implementations of both the preferences and GG contracts.

JozsefFollowDec 12, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readWell, after some time spent coding Solidity, and designing off-chain supporting infrastructure for all the things we\u2019ve been coding in Solidity, I\u2019ve come to truly despise this ubiquitous little dialect.Note that this is the opposite of what usually happens.In my .NET developer days, I was severely prejudiced against JavaScript, which, after a month or two spent with Node.js, I actually grew to love more than I ever liked C#. (Truth be told, my heart lies with ES6 \u2014 async/await is a gift from heaven, truly, but still.)I saw Python as a useless kids\u2019 language, a contemporary heir to Commodore Basic and its ilk, until I started using Python\u2026 Which is when I really \u201cgot it\u201d, and learned to actually like its simplicity, its cute \u201cpythonic\u201d nature.Solidity however? Well, at first I thought it was great, I mean it\u2019s the language of Ethereum, and Ethereum is the definition of awesome, right? Well, add a few months, and I cannot express in words how much I loathe this language. What\u2019s with this type system?! Who on Earth ever thought that this was a good idea?Honestly, it\u2019s kinda like Japanese script. A square peg of immense proportions hammered into a round hole with great abandon, breaking peg and hole alike, and then the rough edges filed off, badly. (No offense to any Japanese readers, but seriously, your script system is the oldest and greatest example on Earth of technical debt running wild.)And sure, break Ethereum it did. Multiple times. Last time, in the fabulous \u201cI accidentally killed it\u201d incident. Also, in the process, what started out as a subset of Javascript syntax became something completely different, and not in a good way.At first I was so glad that Solidity has all these include and inheritance features. Seemed incredibly useful\u2026 However, I soon found that installing a program you\u2019d consider of moderate size in the off-chain world will easily exceed the block gas limit. So why do we need inheritance, again?After an initial and misguided period of actually using inheritance (and getting burned by human mistakes and compiler bugs alike), I have fallen back on an Interfaces + Code model. Interfaces are there to enforce public interfaces. Code is there to describe behavior. One contract, one code file. That\u2019s it.That makes Solidity slightly less unseemly, but does nothing to fix the deeply broken type system, which the real bogeyman is. So where can we turn? Fortunately, a newer, better, cleaner Ethereum contract language is in development, called Viper. Unlike Solidity, it\u2019s actually coming from the source (Vitalik), and is based on Python.Even though it\u2019s still in alpha, I found it incredibly likable at first sight. For one, there is no code reuse built into the language. No includes, no inheritance. That might sound bad at first, but not if you consider the specifics of the platform you\u2019re developing on. Also, the type system looks pretty simple and a lot better thought through than the one in Solidity.I intend to write a few posts about exploring this new language, and getting familiar with its quirks and gotchas.

JozsefFollowMar 10, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readSolidity became such a hit phenomenon specifically because it makes people believe they can code Ethereum. After all, a smart contract isn\u2019t that complex (it cannot be too complex, given the platform limitations)\u2026 but then, this is coupled with a language structure that is far from obvious (did you even know Solidity had pointers, and even worse, pointer arithmetic?), and a million plus one ways to mess up.Solidity is overly complicated, full of traps that lead to insecure code, or can be exploited to write intentionally insecure, backdoored code. It doesn\u2019t present idiomatic guidelines for code, it provides dozens of ways to solve the same simplistic task over and over, it does nothing to guide the developer\u2019s hand, or even make them aware of what they are in the process of doing.I\u2019m doing a series on Vyper, the new Ethereum language, which is a gigantic leap ahead compared to Solidity, but as a general-purposed language, I still think using it should be the exception, not the norm. 90% of smart contracts on Ethereum are either (1) tokens, or (2) value stores with various locking mechanisms. There is no reason whatsoever to re-implement these in generic languages over and over.The way this is done by others is using domain-specific languages. Chain, probably one of the most influential players in our space, has developed Ivy \u2014 a domain-specific language for the exact two use cases mentioned above. Bitcoin is getting an Ivy compiler. So I wonder, if Bitcoin has one, why don\u2019t we have one?I was talking to a Hyperledger guy recently, and it felt like I was back in the 90s, talking to a mainframe guy who\u2019s only interested in \u201creal computers\u201d, none of these pissant PCs\u2026 Well, it turns out, his main problem with Ethereum was none other than Solidity. And I couldn\u2019t agree with him more. If I was doing systems design for a bank, would I consider Solidity as a language I want in our stack? Fuck no. Seriously. No.And what other options do you have if you\u2019re working on Ethereum? (And why wouldn\u2019t you want to work on Ethereum? Ethereum as an infrastructure is really well-built, and there\u2019s an immense amount of R&D going into it.) Well, it turns out, there aren\u2019t a lot of production-ready, well-maintained languages to begin with, but also we have a problem with ecosystem lock-in.I still remember the ubiquitiously hated little \u201cDesigned for Windows 95\u201d badge. It was on everything from games to floppy disk cases. Well, we now its equally hateful equivalent. Truffle? Designed for Solidity. Ganache? Designed for Solidity. Remix? Designed for fucking Solidity. Using any other language forces you to abandon the existing tooling, and go pedestrian. Sure, it\u2019s not a whole lot of tooling to begin with, and last time I checked, the debugger was completely useless, but it still pisses me off.Leave the EVM alone!!!Seriously. It\u2019s not its fault. Ethereum was designed with simplicity in mind. The EVM is almost as simple as a textbook Turing machine. Actually, it\u2019s simpler. It\u2019s the bare minimum of what you can call a processor, real or virtual.So when new blockchain projects spring up trying to fix Solidity\u2019s issues by replacing the EVM, I can\u2019t help but feel a certain way. Would it be cool if EVM bytecode was more transparent to static analysis? Sure, but in an open source ecosystem it wouldn\u2019t be a killer feature, if\u2026the high level language the contract was written in was transparent to static analysis, andthe compiler was formally audited for correctness (ie. the semantics of the output matches the input.)The EVM and its simplicity and generality are a feature of Ethereum, not a bug. The bug is that people are using literally the world\u2019s crappiest, most amateurish language ever for coding security-critical applications on it.The power and limits of going domain-specificNow I\u2019m not saying that ditching multi-purpose languages is a goal. While I cannot see Solidity with anything but contempt, Vyper is quite cool, and for very specific tasks I see value in using LLL time to time. The weakness of Ethereum is also one of its strengths, a multi-purpose language allows for anything and everything to be developed. (Which is also why I argue for keeping the EVM itself.)Ivy, being domain-specific, by its nature constricts its uses to a specific domain (tokenized value and transactions with it). It\u2019s beautifully focused and fully declarative, built on verify, unlock and lock statements.It allows for the verification of credentials and business rules, the conditional unlocking of value based on these verifications, and the locking of value for the recipient. Instead of having to implement balance handling for the n+1th time, you can actually focus on what makes your stuff different.In Ethereum, the concept of Libraries tried to solve the issue of having to implement basic functionality again and again. It failed so spectacularly and catastrophically (due to no specific fault of the concept, but design faults of Solidity, and the horrid implementation of the Solidity Library pattern itself), that today it\u2019s barely ever used, and raises major flags with auditors and clients when it is.Domain specific languages, and declarative languages generally need an underlying infrastructure written in more general, and typically imperative languages. Prolog/CLP solvers tends to be written in C++. So Ivy, or other domain specific languages on Ethereum won\u2019t be the be-all-end-all of Ethereum programming.The infrastructure that will allow DApp developers to use these high-level and high-reliability tools will need some form of the Library concept. However, that underlyning infrastructure will need to be rock solid and secure\u2014 Parity multisig wallets have taught us at least this much.

For example, when the app loaded \u2014 front and center on the screen \u2014 in the editor \u2014 was `Ballot.sol` \u2014 which is rather cryptic for beginners. Because Remix is a landing page for new users to smart contract programming, we needed to improve their first impression.We don\u2019t want to limit the development of Remix to what our team can produce. We think it is a lot more valuable for the community to build a plugin framework where any team can create its own plugin for Remix. This means, that YOU can build a plugin for Remix to extend its functionality in a direction that you\u2019d like.We started to build something in that direction last year. Now it\u2019s time to make it a powerful framework (GrandSchtroumpf is the main developer of the remix-plugin infrastructure) and things are moving nicely!The basic functionalities are now in place and more will come soon.Every feature is now loaded as plugin and displayed either in the side panel for plugins suited to vertical format or in the main panel (as a tab) for a horizontal format or if the plugin is a full featured app (lianahus and Rob Stupay were involved on this).

Here are some of the commonly known vulnerabilities that we considered (the full list includes them but is not limited to them):ReentrancyFront RunningDoS with (Unexpected) revertDoS with Block Gas LimitGas Limit and LoopsLocked moneyUnchecked external callERC20 Standard violationUnsafe use of timestampUsing blockhash for randomnessBalance equalityUnsafe transfer of etherFallback abusePrivate modifierProject overviewProject descriptionIn our analysis we consider Monti Software specification (\u201dVexchange Documentation.docx\u201d, sha1sum: 25d73c616dc2216f64d8a6df7f1a52bdbddf9501), documentation of Uniswap project (the one that audited project was forked from), and smart contracts\u2019 code (version on commit 166eec03ec7c1e7ab137b5def77c5448c915bf0c).The latest version of the codeAfter the initial audit, some fixes were applied and the code was updated to the latest version (version on commit d73e3c6eb74add88e5281d12a1c1d1a5cb6ea984).Project architectureFor the audit, we were provided with the project, which is a pip package.The project successfully compiles with vyper commandThe total LOC of audited Vyper sources is 425.Automated analysisWe used publicly available automated Vyper analysis tool. Here are the results of SmartCheck scanning. All the issues found by the tool were manually checked (rejected or confirmed).Manual analysisThe contracts were completely manually analyzed, their logic was checked and compared with the one described in the documentation. Besides, the results of the automated analysis were manually verified. All confirmed issues are described below.Critical issuesCritical issues seriously endanger smart contracts security. We highly recommend fixing them.The audit showed no critical issues.Medium severity issuesMedium issues can influence smart contracts operation in the current implementation. We highly recommend addressing them.BugsThere are several bugs in the contracts code:uniswap_exchange.vy, lines 60\u201366:def sqrt(x: uint256) -> uint256:    z: uint256 = (x + 1) / 2    y: uint256 = x    for i in range(18):        y = z        z = ((x / z) + z) / 2    return yThis function fails with an exception due to division by zero if x equals zero (sqrt(0)). Also, sqrt() function will execute the senseless loop if x equals one (sqrt(1)). We recommend fixing sqrt() function by separately considering the case when x is equal to zero.uniswap_factory.vy, lines 24\u201325:self.default_max_platform_fee = 1000self.default_max_swap_fee = 1000However, the accuracy of calculations is 1/10000 in uniswap_exchange.vy file.Also, the comment in uniswap_exchange.vy, line 33 says:# must be between 1 to 10000 that represent the the fee percent from 10000We recommend replacing the values of default_max_platform_fee and default_max_swap_fee variables with 10000.The formula used in calculate_platform_profit() function is incorrect (uniswap_exchange.vy, line 73):platform_liquidity_minted: uint256 = (total_liquidity * platform_profit * self.platform_fee /(10000 + platform_profit * (10000 \u2014 self.platform_fee))) / 1000platform_profit variable in the denominator of the fraction should be divided by 1000. We recommend replacing this formula with the following one:platform_liquidity_minted: uint256 = total_liquidity * platform_profit * self.platform_fee /(10000000 + platform_profit * (10000 \u2014 self.platform_fee))The initial formula was modified. The recheck did not reveal any vulnerabilities in the new one.The issues have been fixed and are not present in the latest version of the code.Invalid code logicThere is a code logic issue in uniswap_exchange.vy, line 578:def token_scrape(token_addr: address, deadline: timestamp)token_scrape() function works incorrectly: ETH received after Exchange(exchange_addr).tokenToEthSwapInput() call will trigger __default__() function of the current exchange contract. Thus, ethToTokenInput() function will be called with 2300 gas stipend provided by send() function. Therefore, the whole transaction will revert with an out-of-gas exception. Hence, it is impossible to unlock stuck tokens. We highly recommend fixing this functionality.The issue has been fixed and is not present in the latest version of the code.No tests and deployment scriptThe provided code does not contain tests. Testing is crucial for code security and audit does not replace tests in any way.We highly recommend both covering the code with tests and making sure that the test coverage is sufficient.There is also no deployment script. However, the contracts deployment does not seem trivial. Bugs and vulnerabilities often appear in deployment scripts and severely endanger system\u2019s security. We highly recommend developing and testing deployment scripts very carefully.Low severity issuesLow severity issues can influence smart contracts operation in future versions of code. We recommend taking them into account.Lack of the documentationThe documentation provided with the code is not complete. The information regarding the formula used in calculate_platform_profit() function (uniswap_exchange.vy, line 70) is not sufficient. We recommend clarifying the description of this formula in the documentation.BugThere is a bug in uniswap_exchange.vy, line 112:self.previous_invariant = as_unitless_number(msg.value) * max_tokensWe recommend calculating self.previous_invariant variable in the same way as on line 99:self.previous_invariant = as_unitless_number(self.balance) * (token_reserve + token_amount)This formula is more secure as ETH or tokens can be transferred to the contract before the first addLiquidity() function call.The issue has been fixed and is not present in the latest version of the code.ERC20 approveThere is ERC20 approve issue in uniswap_exchange.vy, line 536: changing the approved amount from a nonzero value to another nonzero value allows a double spending with a front-running attack.We recommend implementing increaseApproval() and decreaseApproval() functions. Moreover, we recommend instructing users to follow one of two ways:not to use approve() function directly and to use increaseApproval()/decreaseApproval() functions insteadto change the approved amount to 0, wait for the transaction to be mined, and then to change the approved amount to the desired valueThe issue has been fixed and is not present in the latest version of the code. Nevertheless, we still recommend instructing users in the ways described above.Invalid valuesThe values of name and symbol state variables used for the liquidity tokens are the same as in the original project (uniswap_exchange.vy, lines 47\u201348):self.name = 0x556e69737761702056310000...self.symbol = 0x554e492d56310000...We recommend replacing them with the new ones.The issue has been fixed and is not present in the latest version of the code.Wrong ABIIn abi folder, uniswap_exchange.json and uniswap_factory.json files do not match the corresponding ABI files, generated by the compiler. We recommend replacing wrong ABI with the correct ones.The issue has been fixed and is not present in the latest version of the code.TypoWe found several typos in the code:uniswap_factory.vy:defualt_swap_fee: uint256There should be default_swap_fee instead of defualt_swap_fee across the file.uniswap_exchange.vy, line 70:def cacluate_platform_profit(eth_reserve: uint256, token_reserve: uint256) -> uint256:There should be calculate_platform_profitinstead of cacluate_platform_profit()uniswap_exchange.vy, line 77:@dev min_amount has a djfferent meaning when total UNI supply is 0.There should be different instead of djfferent.In uniswap_exchange.vy, lines 147,161:@dev Pricing functon for converting between ETH and Tokens.There should be function instead of functon.The issues have been fixed and are not present in the latest version of the code.NatSpec mismatchThere are several NatSpec comments mismatches:uniswap_exchange.vy, line 79: max_tokens should be used instead of min_amount.uniswap_exchange.vy, line 452: exchange_addr should be used instead of token_addr.We highly recommend fixing all the mismatches and using the NatSpec accurately and correctly.The issues have been fixed and are not present in the latest version of the code.Code styleIn uniswap_factory.vy file, initializeFactory() function is used for variables initialization. However, it is not the best practice. We recommend using the constructor for state variables initialization instead.The issue has been fixed and is not present in the latest version of the code.Redundant codeThe following line is redundant (uniswap_exchange.vy, line 108):token_amount: uint256 = max_tokenstoken_amount variable is redundant as it is equal to max_token variable. We highly recommend removing redundant code in order to improve code readability and transparency and decrease cost of deployment and execution.The issue has been fixed and is not present in the latest version of the code.Missing checksThere are several missing checks in the code:uniswap_factory.vy, lines 47\u201350, 53\u201356:def setMaxPlatformFee(_default_max_platform_fee: uint256)def setMaxSwapFee(_default_max_swap_fee: uint256)In these functions the new maximum value is not checked to be greater than the corresponding current fee value (default_platform_fee or default_swap_fee respectively). We highly recommend implementing the following checks in setMaxPlatformFee() and setMaxSwapFee() functions respectively:assert _default_max_platform_fee >= self.default_platform_feeassert _default_max_swap_fee >= self.default_swap_feeIn tokenToTokenTransferInput() and tokenToTokenTransferOutput() functions (uniswap_exchange.vy, lines 355\u2013357, 397\u2013399) the following check is missing:assert recipient != selfWe highly recommend implementing missing check in order to avoid loss of tokens.The issues have been fixed and are not present in the latest version of the code.NotesMalicious tokensThe platform is designed to be used with various tokens with an unknown code. This can lead to the undesired consequences for the corresponding uniswap_exchange contracts:Reentrancy at lines 256\u2013257:send(recipient, wei_bought)assert self.token.transferFrom(buyer, self, tokens_sold)Reentrancy at lines 291\u2013292:send(recipient, eth_bought)assert self.token.transferFrom(buyer, self, tokens_sold)Impact on the economy due to unlimited mint/burn functionality. For instance, if the token owner burns tokens from uniswap_exchange contract, the invariant will decrease.As this problem cannot be fixed, we recommend taking it into account.Unexpected ETH/tokensprevious_invariant state variable of uniswap_exchange contract is supposed to keep invariant at the moment of the last addLiquidity()/ removeLiquidity() functions call. Moreover, the difference between the new invariant and the previous one is supposed to appear based on the fees from the trade volume. However, it can also be changed by sending ETH or tokens to the contract using selfdestruct() and transfer() functions respectively without calling the addLiquidity()/removeLiquidity() functions. We recommend taking it into account.NatSpec misuseThe NatSpec comments in the code violates the Vyper Documentation (starting from v0.1.0-beta.6). We recommend using triple quotes (\"\"\") instead of hashes (#) to highlight NatSpec comments.The issue has been fixed and is not present in the latest version of the code.Private visibility levelPrivate visibility level is used in the following lines:uniswap_exchange.vy, lines 27\u201338:balances: uint256[address]allowances: (uint256[address])[address]token: address(ERC20)factory: Factorylast_invariant: decimalowner: addressplatform_fee: uint256platform_fee_max: uint256swap_fee: uint256swap_fee_max: uint256anotherToken: address(ERC20)previous_invariant: uint256uniswap_factory.vy, lines 12\u201315:defualt_swap_fee: uint256default_platform_fee: uint256default_max_swap_fee: uint256default_max_platform_fee: uint256We recommend taking into account that, \u0441ontrary to a popular misconception, anyone can see values of private variables in the blockchain.This audit was performed by SmartDec, a security team specialized in static code analysis, decompilation and secure development.Feel free to use SmartCheck, our smart contract security tool for Solidity and Vyper languages, and follow us on Medium.

Image Source: Screenshot taken from the movie \u201cThe Matrix Revolutions\u201dDesign patterns are God\u2019s gift to software developers. These are techniques that minimize code duplication, prevents high coupling and standardize a common way of writing code that provides a general solution for recurring situation while developing a software. In this story we will get familiar with a design pattern called VIPER (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity and Router.) for iOS development.Prerequisites: Before starting about VIPER, please make sure you know about architectural design pattern and delegation pattern.What is Viper ?Viper is a design pattern that implements \u2018separation of concern\u2019 paradigm. Mostly like MVP or MVC it follows a modular approach. One feature, one module. For each module VIPER has five (sometimes four) different classes with distinct roles. No class go beyond its sole purpose. These classes are following.View: Class that has all the code to show the app interface to the user and get their responses. Upon receiving a response View alerts the Presenter.Presenter: Nucleus of a module. It gets user response from the View and work accordingly. Only class to communicate with all the other components. Calls the router for wire-framing, Interactor to fetch data (network calls or local data calls), view to update the UI.Interactor: Has the business logics of an app. Primarily make API calls to fetch data from a source. Responsible for making data calls but not necessarily from itself.Router: Does the wire-framing. Listens from the presenter about which screen to present and executes that.Entity: Contains plain model classes used by the interactor.Below shows a simple diagram of VIPERViper ArchitectureViper with ExampleI have created a simple project to explain viper. It can be found on GitHub. It is a very basic application which shows a news headline fetched from an external API. (how useless :p).Viper is a delegation driven architecture. So, most of the communication between different layers executes through delegation. One layer calls another through a protocol. Calling layer calls a function from a protocol. Listening layer conforms to that protocol and implements the function.Below I will explain how I have implemented VIPER in one of my sample projects. I suggest you to open the project in github and go through it while reading the explanation.ProtocolsI have created a separate file for all the protocols.A naming convention is followed to name a protocol. E.g, \u2018viewToPresenterProtocol\u2019. So, it is a \u2018protocol\u2019 which will be implemented by \u2018the presenter\u2019 to listen what the \u2018view\u2019 has to say.PresenterToViewProtocol : Presenter calls, View listens. Presenter receives a reference from this protocol to access View. View conforms to the protocol.ViewToPresenterProtocol : View calls, Presenter listens.InteractorToPresenterProtocol : Interactor calls, Presenter listens.PresentorToInterectorProtocol : Presenter calls, Interactor listens.PresenterToRouterProtocol : Presenter calls, Router listens.App FlowView has a reference of \u2018 ViewToPresenterProtocol\u2019 to access the \u2018Presenter\u2019 and conforms to \u2018 PresenterToViewProtocol\u2019. In it\u2019s viewDidLoad() it calls the function updateView() of the protocol.//Viewvar presenter: ViewToPresenterProtocol?override func viewDidLoad() {           super.viewDidLoad()           presenter?.updateView()           }Presenter on the other hand conforms to \u2018 ViewToPresenterProtocol\u2019. So, it implements the function updateView().//Presentervar interector: PresentorToInterectorProtocol?;func updateView() {   interector?.fetchLiveNews()    }Inside updateView() presenter tells the interactor to fetch some live news data.Interactor conforms to \u2018PresentorToInterectorProtocol\u2019 . So it implements fetchLiveNews() function. This function tries to make a network call and fetch data. It has a reference from \u2018InterectorToPresenterProtocol\u2019 to access the \u2018Presenter\u2019.//Interactorvar presenter: InterectorToPresenterProtocol?If the network call successfully have fetched the data it calls the following function.//Interactorself.presenter?.liveNewsFetched(news: (arrayObject?[0])!)if not//Interactorself.presenter?.liveNewsFetchedFailed()Now presenter also conforms to \u2018 InterectorToPresenterProtocol\u2019. So it implements these functions.//presenterfunc liveNewsFetched(news: LiveNewsModel) {        view?.showNews(news: news);    }        func liveNewsFetchedFailed(){        view?.showError()    }So it tells the view whether to show news or to show the error.Now, View conforms to \u2018 PresenterToViewProtocol\u2019. Thus it implements showNews() and showError(). In these two functions view populates the view with the fetched data or the error.The Entity LayerAbove in the app flow section entity layer is not discussed. It does not directly connected with the app flow. But it is an integral part for the interactor. Entity layer provides a model which interactor use to create objects from the fetched data.RouterRouter takes care the wire framing of an application. Changing screen in an application is a very basic thing. In VIPER, Router layer is responsible for executing that.We have discussed earlier that in VIPER architecture every single functionality has a single module and a module contains those five layers. A presenter calls the router to create a new module. Then router first initiate all the layer class and returns the module.In my sample project there is no in-app module changing. But routing does happen when the app first time launches. So inside AppDelegate\u2019s \u2018didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()\u2019, router\u2019s createModule() function is called. It returns a module. UIWindow class then show the view of that module.Why and When to use VIPERVIPER follows a very clean architecture. It isolates each module from others. So changing or fixing bugs are very easy as you only have to update a specific module. Also for having modular approach VIPER creates a very good environment for unit testing. As each module is independent from others, it maintains low coupling very well. So, dividing work among co-developers are pretty simple.VIPER should be used when an application\u2019s requirements are very well formed. Working with constantly changing requirements may create confusion and messed up codes. So, it should not be used in small project as MVP or MVC will suffice. Also, VIPER should be used if all the developer of the project fully understands the pattern.VIPER ToolsIf one wants to use VIPER in a project, the smartest thing would be to use an automatic module structure generator. Otherwise creating files for modules will be monotonous. There are few generators available online.GenerambaVIPER CodeVIPER GenConclusionJust like any other design pattern VIPER is self-explanatory. One needs to get one\u2019s hands dirty to understand the whole picture. My advice will be to first start with creating a very basic app with VIPER and in the process read online resource. My github repo could also be a good reference.Happy coding :)Long live sacred Bangladesh.Bangladesh is a world of metaphor, of high and low theater, of great poetry and music.

Most of these articles are biased about it and trying to demonstrate how cool it is. It\u2019s not. It has at least the same amount of problems, if not even more, as other architecture patterns. In this article, I want to explain why VIPER isn\u2019t as good as it is advertised and isn\u2019t suitable for most of your apps.Some articles about comparing architectures usually claim that VIPER is an entirely different from any MVC-based architectures. This claim is not true: It\u2019s just a normal MVC, where we are splitting controller into two parts: interactor and presenter. View remains the same, but model is renamed to entity. Router deserves some special words: Yes, it\u2019s true, other architectures don\u2019t promote this part in their abbreviation, but it still exists, in implicit (yes, when you call pushViewController you are writing a simple router) or more explicit way (for example FlowCoordinators).Now I want to talk about benefits that VIPER is offering you. I\u2019ll use this book as a complete reference about VIPER. Let\u2019s start with the second goal, conforming to SRP (Single Responsibility Principle). It\u2019s a little rough, but what strange mind can call this a benefit? You\u2019re paid for solving tasks, not for conforming to some buzzword. Yes, you are still using TDD, BDD, unit-tests, Realm or SQLite, dependency injection, and whatever you can remember, but you are using it for solving customer\u2019s problem, not for just using it.TestingAnother goal is way more interesting. Testability is a very important concern. It deserves a standalone article since many people are talking about it, but only a few are really testing their apps and even fewer are doing it right.One of the main reasons of that is a lack of good examples. There are many articles about creating a unit test with assert 2 + 2 == 4 but no real-life examples (btw, Artsy is doing an excellent job by open sourcing their apps, you should take a look at their projects).VIPER is suggesting to separate all logic into a bunch of small classes with separated responsibilities. It may make testing easier, but not always. Yes, writing unit-test for a simple class is easy, but most of this tests are testing nothing. For example, let\u2019s look at most of a presenter\u2019s methods, they are just a proxy between a view and other components. You can write tests for that proxy, it will increase test coverage of your code, but these tests are useless. You also have a side effect: you should update these useless tests after each edit in the main code.The proper approach to testing should include testing interactor and presenter at the same time because these two parts are deeply integrated. Moreover, because we separate between two classes we need much more tests in comparison with a case when we have just one class. It\u2019s a simple \u0441ombinatorics: class A has 4 possible states, class B has 6 possible states, so a combination of A and B has 20 states, and you should test it all.The right approach to simplify testing is introducing purity to code instead of just splitting complicated state into a bunch of classes.It may sound strange, but testing views is easier than testing some business code. A view exposes state as a set of properties and inherits visual appearance from these properties. Then you can use FBSnapshotTestCase for matching state with appearance. It still doesn\u2019t handle some edge cases like custom transitions, but how often do you implement it?Overengineered designVIPER is what happens when former enterprise Java programmers invade the iOS world. \u2013n0damage, reddit commentHonestly, can someone look at this and say: \u201cyes, these extra classes and protocols really improved my ability to understand what is going on with my application\u201d.Imagine simple task: we have a button that triggers an update from a server and a view with data from a server response. Guess how much classes/protocols will be affected by this change? Yes, at least 3 classes and 4 protocols are going to be changed for this simple feature. Does nobody remembers how Spring started with some abstractions and ended with AbstractSingletonProxyFactoryBean? I always want a \u201cconvenient proxy factory bean superclass for proxy factory beans that create only singletons\u201d in my code.Redundant componentsAs I already mentioned it before, a presenter is usually a very dumb class which is just proxying calls from view to interactor (something like this). Yes, sometimes it contains complicated logic, but in most cases it\u2019s just a redundant component.\u201cDI-friendly\u201d amount of protocolsThere is a common confusion with this abbreviation: VIPER is implementing SOLID principles where DI means \u201cdependency inversion\u201d, not \u201cinjection\u201d. Dependency injection is a special case of Inversion of Control pattern, which is related, but different from Dependency Inversion.Dependency Inversion is about separating modules from different levels by introducing abstractions between them. For example, UI module shouldn\u2019t directly depends on network or persistence module. Inversion of Control is different, it\u2019s when a module (usually from a library which we can\u2019t change) delegates something to another module, which is typically provided to the first module as a dependency. Yes, when you implement data source for your UITableView you are using IoC principle. Using the same language features for different high-level purposes is a source of confusion here.Let\u2019s back to VIPER. There are many protocols (at least 5) between each class inside a module. And they are not required at all. Presenter and Interactor aren\u2019t modules from different layers. Applying IoC principle can make sense, but ask yourself a question: how often do you implement at least two presenters for one view? I believe most of you answered zero. So why it\u2019s required to create this bunch of protocols which we\u2019ll never use?Also, because of these protocols, you can\u2019t easily navigate your code with an IDE, because cmd+click will navigate you to a protocol, instead of a real implementation.Performance problemsIt is a crucial thing and there are a lot of people who just don\u2019t care about it, or are just underestimating an impact from bad architecture decisions.I won\u2019t talk about Typhoon framework (which is very popular for dependency injection in the ObjC world). Of course, it has some performance impact, especially when you use auto-injection, but VIPER doesn\u2019t require you to use it. Instead, I want to talk about runtime and app startup and how VIPER is slowing your app literally everywhere.App startup time. It is rarely discussed, but it\u2019s an important topic, if your app launches very slowly users will avoid using it. There was a session on last WWDC about optimizing app startup time in last year. TL; DR: Your app startup time directly depends on how many classes you have. If you have 100 classes it\u2019s fine, nobody will notice this. However if your app has just 100 classes do you really need this complicated architecture? But if your app is huge, for example, you\u2019re working on Facebook app (18k classes) this impact is enormous, something around 1 second according to the previously mentioned session. Yes, cold launching your app will take 1 second just to load all classes metadata and nothing else, you read it right.Runtime dispatch. It is more complicated, much harder to profile and mostly applicable for Swift compiler only (because ObjC has rich runtime capabilities and a compiler can\u2019t safely perform these optimizations). Let\u2019s talk about what is going on underhood when you call some method (I use \u201ccall\u201d instead of \u201csend a message\u201d because the second term is not always correct for Swift). There are 3 types of dispatch in Swift (from faster to slower): static, table dispatch and sending a message. The last one is the only type that is used in ObjC, and it\u2019s used in Swift when interop with ObjC code is required, or when we declare a method as dynamic. Of course, this part of the runtime is hugely optimized and written in assembler for all platforms. But what if we can avoid this overhead because the compiler has knowledge about what is going to be called at compile time? It\u2019s exactly what Swift compiler is doing with static and table dispatch. Static dispatch is fast, but the compiler can\u2019t use it without 100% confidence in types in the expression. But when our variable\u2019s type is a protocol the compiler is forced to use dispatch via protocol witness tables. It\u2019s not literally slow, but 1ms here, 1ms there, and now total execution time is more than one second higher than we could achieve using pure Swift code. This paragraph is related to previous about protocols, but I think it\u2019s better to separate concerns about just reckless amount of unused protocols with a real messing with the compiler with it.Weak abstractions separationThere should be one \u2014 and preferably only one \u2014 obvious way to do it.One of the most popular question in VIPER community is \u201cwhere I should put X?\u201d. So, from the one side, there are many rules how we should do things right, but from another side a lot of stuff is opinion-based. It can be complicated cases, for example handling CoreData with NSFetchedResultsController, or UIWebView. But even common cases, like using UIAlertController, is a topic for discussion. Let\u2019s take a look, here we have a router dealing with alert, but there we have a view presenting an alert. You can try to beat this with an argument that is a simple alert is a special case for simple alert without any actions except closing.Special cases aren\u2019t special enough to break the rules.Yeah, but why here we have a factory for creating that kind of alerts? So, we have a mess even with such simple case with UIAlertController. Do you want it?Code generationReadability counts.How can this be an issue with an architecture? It\u2019s just generating a bunch of template classes instead of writing it by myself. What is the problem with that? The problem is most time you are reading code (unless you are working in a throwaway outsourcing company), not writing it. So you are reading boilerplate code messed with an actual code most of your time. Is it good? I don\u2019t think so.ConclusionI don\u2019t pursue a goal to discourage you from using VIPER at all. There is still can be some apps that can benefit from all. However, before you start developing your app you should ask yourself a few questions:Is this app is going to have a long lifetime?Are specifications stable enough? Alternatively, you can end up with endless huge refactorings even for small changes.Do you really test your apps? Be honest with yourself.Only if you answer \u201cyes\u201d to all questions VIPER may be a good choice for your app.Finally, the last one: you should use your own brain for your decisions, don\u2019t just blindly trust some guy from Medium or conference your attended who is saying: \u201cUse X, X is cool.\u201d These guys can be wrong too.", "responses": 27, "tags": ["iOS App Development", "iOS", "Viper", "Software Architecture", "Software Development"]}, {"title": "The Good, The Bad and the Ugly of VIPER architecture for iOS apps.", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@ankoma22/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-viper-architecture-for-ios-apps-7272001b5347?source=search_post", "author_name": "Andrej Malyhin", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ankoma22", "publish_date": "2016-10-17", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-26", "readtime": "6.26", "claps": 938, "voters": 235, "content": "The Good, The Bad and the Ugly of VIPER architecture for iOS apps.Andrej MalyhinFollowOct 17, 2016 \u00b7 7 min readIntroduction to VIPERIf you were developing iOS apps for some time you\u2019ve noticed that most of your logic goes inside UIViewController\u2019s subclasses. It\u2019s commonly referred as Massive ViewController problem. View is rather a simple object that cares only about drawing itself on a screen. Model is a dull storage of data which can be represented by a simple collection or a complex data structure.And basically, all other logic should go inside this poor lonely ViewController. It\u2019s transforming model objects into some more View-friendly state and vice-versa. It\u2019s also handling user input, fetching data, making network calls, allocating and presenting other ViewControllers. Does it fair that all this fun goes to ViewController?It\u2019s not only ViewController\u2019s readability that suffers from extra weight (in lines of code) but also testability, maintainability, and refactoring speed. Considering that Swift is changing rapidly and Apple releases new iOS every year, maintaining and refactoring ViewControllers is a huge part of your job as an iOS developer. And testability here is really important cos you don\u2019t want those scary regressions.So some smart people decided to improve MVC (Model-View-Controller) in a way that ViewController basically goes on a diet. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) was the first try. It releases ViewController from the need to perform conversion between Model objects (business objects if you like) into View-friendly (let\u2019s call them ViewModels from now on) objects. This approach improves testability and makes ViewControlles leaner, but is it enough? It does not address responding to actions, networking, navigation and so on. So people decided that they need to free ViewController from these others things as well.First of all, they\u2019ve created Presenter (ViewModel in case of MVVM). This class is responsible for updating User Interface. It receives business-objects and translates them into ViewModels.Where it receives them from? From another class called Interactor which is responsible for getting business-objects from everywhere it can: network, persistence storage, and passing them into Presenter. It also responsible for responding to user actions. So when you press Login button your ViewController pass it to Interactor and it makes network call (usually, you want to do that in a separate object, more on that below), waits for the response and then decides where you need to go next.So when Interactor makes this decision it calls another object called Router (you may find Wireframe in some articles) which performs segues or present ViewControllers modally.So you may ask what\u2019s left for ViewController? Apart from communication with Presenter it still manages a lot of things. Since we are playing on UIKit\u2019s territory we are not free from its influence. I believe that you should assign your ViewController to be delegate and dataSource of various things. By doing so you won\u2019t make some crazy things with your Interactor. Don\u2019t try to break UIKit. It is impossible and unnecessary.So we have V for View, I for Interactor, P for Presenter, R for Router. So what\u2019s E in VIPER stands for? E stands for Entity. Entity is basically what you were calling Model in MVC \u2014 dull data storage. Personally, I feel that it was put in VIPER just to make it sounds cool. Your Interactor will obtain those Entities from various sources but also will make network calls or perform some long-term tasks using Services \u2014 objects that encapsulate this kind of tasks. For example, you may create TasksService in ToDoList app (every iOS developer should make one) that will make network call to the server, parse the response into business-object and give it back to Interactor. Let\u2019s say you will find fireDate in the response. It will be similar to this format: \u201c1994\u201311\u201305T08:15:30\u201305:00\u201d, but in the View you should show something like \u201c2 hours remaining\u201d. Interactor passes Date object to Presenter which converts Date into String and passes it to ViewController.But we\u2019re missing some crucial element here. Each of your ViewController requires Interactor, Presenter, and Router. All these things communicate with each other by extensive use of protocols. So you need to assemble all these guys and make them know each other. This is done by an object called Configurator or Assembly.So now we have everything we need to create one isolated part of VIPER architecture called Module.Example of Viper ModuleYou should know that there is no such thing as common VIPER module. Some developers connect Router with Presenter instead of Interactor, others use a separate object that works with Entities, etc.We\u2019ve been using VIPER for about 3 months. Not really long time, you might say, but it\u2019s enough to see some pitfalls.The GoodVIPER is an attempt to apply SOLID principles on iOS platform. It is not only architecture but also set of rules and agreements. And it is so helpful. Once you got used to it there will be no turning back. Just give it a try you\u2019ll like it.Testability out-of-the-box. Since Modules are loose coupled it is really easy to test them separately. Every object inside the Module is also separated well enough which is great for Unit Testing. 80\u201390% test coverage is easy to achieve comparing to MassiveViewController that is almost impossible to test.Since modules are independent VIPER is really good for large teams (in the case of iOS it\u2019s more than two developers). It means fewer merge conflicts, better testability, and easier changes of modules. You may want to create initial architecture skeleton first and then give modules one by one to other developers to implement logic.Codebase looks similar. As long as you start to feel philosophy of VIPER you will be much faster with reading others people code. Files will be smaller (no more 3K lines of code UIViewControllers) logic will be clearer and overall stability and flexibility higher. You could even make cross-platform code reviews of business logic with Android team. How cool is that!The BadVIPER does not fit into Apple\u2019s UIKit paradigm. There is no way that you will be able to easily split your business and representation logic between Interactor and Presenter. Third-party SDK\u2019s often does not fit into VIPER either. So you have to discuss a lot of things with colleagues, try different approaches and experiment. This actually sounds fun for Engineering Team, but try to sell it to Product Team.Little to nothing on documentation, best practices, and community. Apart from several articles all you have is Book Of VIPER written in Russian (only 10% is translated to English at the moment) and nothing else. Since the first article about VIPER that I was able to find was published in 2013 you might guess it is not so popular topic.A new developer should spend a couple of days learning the basics of VIPER and then the couple of weeks familiarizing with it. Extra time on each pull-request, more time to research and discuss. And in the end, all these problems won\u2019t go away. After a while, you will have some set of agreements and how-to\u2019s but there always be new challenges.View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router, Configurator\u2026 You can guess that it\u2019s a lot of files. Twice more with testing. It will be a waste of time making them manually each time. So smart people created automated code generator for VIPER like Generamba. It will not only help you to generate all the files but also protocols and common functions.The UglyCommunication between Modules. In classical VIPER modules should communicate vis Presenters. I disagree with that concept it violates Single responsibility. Since the whole point of VIPER is independent modules we need to find a way to pass data between them without knowing any details about their implementation. Probably the best way to handle this is ViperMcFlurry. But if you will look inside of its code you will see that it is based on method swizzling and associated objects. Doesn\u2019t it ring the bell that something is overcomplicated here?Eventually, you\u2019ll have to build version of VIPER that suits your needs. After a while you\u2019ll notice some pitfalls in VIPER architecture: some modules do not need View, Presenters remain unused etc. Guys at Uber did a great job and created RIBs architecture.Instead of conlusionVIPER looks brilliant on paper: SOLID principles, TDD in its veins, code separation, scalable and so own. But we are living in a real world. We have deadlines, we need to iterate quickly and ship our product to customers ASAP. You might say that it is product managers, designers or even customers fault. I partially agree with this. We as developers should educate managers that speed\u2260quality and sooner or later technical debt will become a problem. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t list that in The Bad section.VIPER is really great when you have plenty of time and your app is not changing a lot. I strongly recommend you to give VIPER a try. You\u2019ll be much better developer after that. In your side project, maybe in some small helper app. It will be much slower at first but after some time you\u2019ll be saving(!) time comparing to MVC. Only then start applying VIPER on your workplace.If you have some questions, here is my Twitter or just reply here.", "responses": 13, "tags": ["iOS", "Swift", "iOS App Development", "Programming", "Mobile App Development"]}, {"title": "Intro to the VIPER design pattern (Swift 3)", "post_link": "https://medium.com/yay-its-erica/intro-to-the-viper-design-pattern-swift-3-32e3574dee02?source=search_post", "author_name": "Erica Millado", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ericamillado", "publish_date": "2017-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-19", "readtime": "2.20", "claps": 448, "voters": 77, "content": "Intro to the VIPER design pattern (Swift 3)Erica MilladoFollowJun 28, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readVIPER \u2014 View-Interactor-Presenter-Entity-RouterVIPER is an acronym that represents an example of a design pattern that can be considered clean architecture. In essence, with clean architecture, you abstract your code into four layers: entities (models), use cases (business logic), controllers/gateways/presenters (handles UI logic), devices/UI/Web/DB/External interfaces (frameworks that could change).VIPER stands for:V \u2014 View (displays info to the user and detects user interaction)I \u2014 Interactor (manipulates the entities/models by fetching data and storing data)P \u2014 Presenter (without use of the UIKit, it contains the UI related business logic and prepares the data for presentation)E \u2014 Entity (your model objects)R \u2014 Router (aka wireframe, takes care of navigation in your module/application).VIPER architecture allows for a clearer separation of concerns and separates the viewController from handling most of the responsibility in an app. Concerns are separated into modules for each use case (i.e. provide a map for the user). Each module has a clear layer of routing logic, presentation logic and business logic.The View (the View Controller):The view/view controller\u2019s main purpose is to display info to the user and detect user interaction. The view/view controller intercepts user events and has ONE POINT OF CONTACT within the VIPER design pattern: the presenter. The view/view controller owns and sends user actions to the presenter. For example, a view/view controller will let a presenter know when it has started loading itself and when a user has tapped on a button.The Presenter:The presenter receives user action information from the view/view controller and is responsible for the UI related (but not UIKit!) business logic data. The presenter prepares the data for presentation. The presenter has THREE POINTS OF CONTACT: the view/view controller, the interactor, and the router. The presenter owns the responsibility of fetching data from the interactor and preparing that data for presentation and passing it back to the view/view controller (so that it can be updated), of creating objects to be handed off to the router and determining if it needs more data from the interactor. I like to think of the presenter as the \u201cmediator\u201d.The Interactor:The interactor has knowledge of our models, or entities, and fetches and stores data from a manager class (i.e. DataStore.swift). The presenter calls on the interactor for updated data and the interactor, in turn, provides it back. The interactor manipulates data (i.e. validates if a Map location has a valid name) and can call on a helper/manager class (LocationStore.swift) to create entities.The Entity/Entities:The entities are our data models (i.e. MapName, MapCoordinate, MapLocation). These entities are manipulated by the interactor. The interactor has full knowledge of the entities and their properties.The Router/The Wireframe:The router has ONE POINT OF CONTACT: the presenter. The router (aka the wireframe) owns a window and takes care of the navigation in a module. It creates the view controller and wires the presenter to serve as the output for the interactor and for the view controller to be the interface for the presenter. The presenter may know where to go, but the router knows how to get there.Resources:Architecting iOS Apps with VIPER \u2014 ObjC", "responses": 2, "tags": ["iOS", "Viper", "Swift 3", "Yay Its Erica"]}, {"title": "Trump sings \u201cLie of the Viper\u201d", "post_link": "https://extranewsfeed.com/trump-sings-lie-of-the-viper-6b065457ed01?source=search_post", "author_name": "Harper Thorpe", "author_link": "https://extranewsfeed.com/@harperthorpe", "publish_date": "2017-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-20", "readtime": "1.31", "claps": 148, "voters": 42, "content": "TrumPooning TunesTrump sings \u201cLie of the Viper\u201dHarper ThorpeFollowAug 16, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readThis is no garden variety snake and should be considered very dangerous.

The architecture we choose will shape on how the software will be built and scale as it grows.One of the architecture this article will approach is the VIPER architecture. VIPER divides the app structure into components inside a module/screen with single responsibility principle. This makes the application becomes more modular and less coupled with other component. Unit testing and Integration test becomes much more simpler because of the boundaries (protocol/interface) between each components.VIPER basic components are separated into 5 parts:View: Shows the user interface told by the presenter, it also communicates back the user input to presenter.Interactor: Process the business logic of the application, it communicates back and forth with the presenterPresenter: Fetch the data from the interactor and handle the logic of how the data will be displayed in view. It also relay the user input from the view and fetch/update the data from interactor.Entity: The model object that used by interactor. Usually the interactor fetch the entity from a separate data store object.Routing/Wireframe: Handle the navigation logic asked by the presenter object. It communicates with other module/screen to be shown.Building Our Todo List App with VIPERIn this article we will build a simple TodoList app using VIPER as our application architecture. The project GitHub repository is available here. What we will build:TodoItem Entity and TodoStore: TodoItem is a basic Class object that represent a Todo item, TodoStore is our DataStore that store an array of TodoItem.TodoList Module/Screen: Display list of TodoItem in a UITableView to users and provide the features for user to add new TodoItem, delete TodoItem, and navigate to the TodoDetail Module/Screen.TodoDetail Module/Screen: Display the content of a TodoItem, provide the features for user to delete and edit the TodoItem. It navigates back to the TodoList Module/Screen.App Delegate Integration: Setup the root UIViewController of the application by instantiating TodoListView from TodoListRouterApplication Flow and Project Structure DiagramBuilding Data EntityTodoItem EntityTodoItem Entity is just a plain class that represent a TodoItem object. It provides 2 properties, title String and content String.TodoItem EntityTodoStore DataStoreTodoStore is the DataStore Singleton object that stores the list of TodoItem. Our application just stores the array in-memory, but we can extend to store the data in a File or CoreData in the future. It exposed the TodoItem array via todos property and methods to add TodoItem and remove TodoItem.TodoStoreBuilding TodoListModule/ScreenTodoListModule ProtocolsWe use protocol for each component to define the boundaries of how each components will communicate in TodoList Module.TodoListModule ProtocolsImplement TodoListViewProtocolWe create a TodoListViewController object that subclass UITableViewController and implement the TodoListViewProtocol. TodoListViewController responsibility is to display the user interface as told by the presenter. It keeps a reference to the presenter to relay user input and view lifecycle event to the presenter to react.When the view will appear it will invoke the presenter viewWillAppear method so the presenter can retrieve the data from the interactor. The navigation add bar button item triggers an action that will display the UIAlertActionController with 2 textfields for the user to enter the title and content of the TodoItem. It then relay the user input back to the presenter. When user swipes the UITableViewCell and delete the row, the view redirects the user input to delete the associated ToDoItem back to presenter.TodoListViewProtocol provide 2 method to implement, showTodos that pass array of ToDoItem that will be used to display list of TodoItem inside the UITableView. The showErrorMessage pass an error message in case of an error occurs from the presenter, the UIAlertController will be displayed containing the error message to the user.TodoList ViewImplement TodoListPresenterProtocolThe TodoListPresenter Class implements the TodoListPresenterProtocol and TodoListInteractorOutputProtocol. It stores weak reference to the TodoListViewProtocol so it can update the UI. It stores reference to the TodoListInteractorInputProtocol so the presenter can relay the user input to fetch or modify data through the interactor. It also stores the TodoListRouterProtocol object so it can navigate to the TodoDetailModule when user select a TodoItem from the table view.By implementing TodoPresenterProtocol, the view will call the presenter viewWillAppear when view will appear in screeen. The presenter then ask yhe interactor to retrieve the TodoItem array. The implementation of TodoListInteractorOutputProtocol will be used by the interactor to return the TodoItem array by invoking didRetrieveTodos passing the data, the presenter then update the view by invoking view showTodos passing the data to update the Table View.The presenter also implements didAddTodo and didRemoveToDo so when user add a new TodoItem or delete a TodoItem from the view, the presenter can relay the user action to the interactor respective saveTodo and deleteTodo method. The interactor will invoke didAddTodo and didRemoveTodo back to the presenter so the presenter can update the Table View.TodoList PresenterImplement TodoListInteractorProtocolThe TodoListInteractor implements the TodoListInteractorInputProtocol. It stores reference to the presenter object that impeements the TodoListInteractorOutputProtocol. It also has the TodoStore object assigned as the property to fetch the TodoItem list, add TodoItem, removeTodoItem from the TodoStore.The TodoListPresenterProtocol invoke the action to retrieve TodoItem List, save TodoItem, delete TodoItem, the interactor then ask the TodoStore for each respective action then invoke the output method back to the presenter.TodoList InteractorImplement TodoListRouterProtocolThe TodoListRouter exposes static function that can be invoke to instantiate the TodoListModule, instantiate the concrete implementation of TodoListProtocols component, assigning the reference for each component, and then return the UIViewController to display.It also provide the presentTodoDetailScreen that will be invoked by the TodoListPresenter when user select a TodoItem from TableView. This method instantiate TodoDetailModule passing the TodoItem from the TodoDetailRouter static method and navigate to the TodoDetailViewController by pushing the UIViewController through the UINavigationController stack.TodoList RouterBuilding TodoDetailModule/ScreenTodoDetailModule ProtocolsJust like TodoListModule, protocol defines the boundaries of how each components will communicate in TodoDetail Module.TodoDetailModule ProtocolsImplement TodoDetailViewProtocolThe TodoDetailViewController is an UIViewController subclass that implements the TodoDetailViewProtocol. When the View is loaded, it invoke the TodoDetailPresenter viewDidLoad method for the presenter to ask the interactor to fetch the ToDoItem to display in the UI.The showTodoItem will be invoked by the presenter passing the TodoItem for the View to display the TodoItem title and content using UILabels. The view also relay the user action to edit and delete when the button is pressed to the deleteTodo method of the presenter. For the edit action, the UIAlertController containing the TextField filled with current TodoItem title and content will be displayed for the user to modify. When they confirm, the view relay back the user input from text fields back to the presenter passing the new value of the title and content.TodoDetail ViewImplement TodoDetailPresenterProtocolThe TodoDetailPresenter implements the TodoDetailPresenterProtocol and TodoDetailInteractorOutputProtocol. When the view is loaded the presenter asks the interactor for the TodoItem, and then asks the view to display the TodoItem by invoking showTodo.It also handle the relay of user action from the view for editing and deleting the TodoItem to the interactor. The implementation of TodoDetailInteractorOutputProtocol handles the result after the interactor successfully edit the item to update the view based on the new value, for the delete it invokes the TodoDetailRouterProtocol to navigate back to the TodoListView because the TodoItem has been deleted.TodoDetail PresenterImplement TodoDetailInteractorProtocolThe TodoDetailInteractor implements the TodoDetailInteractorInputProtocol, it also has reference to the TodoStore and TodoItem object. The presenter can retrieve the TodoItem from the interactor by accessing the property. It also provide methods to delete TodoItem and edit TodoItem. The delete action will invoke the TodoStore removeTodo passing the TodoItem so the TodoItem can be deleted from the TodoStore.TodoDetail InteractorImplement TodoDetailRouterProtocolThe TodoDetailRouter implements the TodoDetailRouterProtocol. It provides static method to instantiate the TodoDetailModule, setup all the components and associate them, then returns the UIViewController to display. It also exposes navigateBackToListViewController that will be invoked when user delete a TodoItem from TodoDetail Screen for navigation back after the TodoItem is deleted.TodoDetail RouterAppDelegate Setup And IntegrationThe AppDelegate setup is quite simple and direct, inside the applicationDidFinishLaunchingWithOptions we instantiate the TodoListViewController by invoking the TodoListRouter.createTodoListModule that setups TodoListModule components. We then instantiate the UIWindow and assign the ViewController as the rootViewController of the window as our initial screen.App DelegateConclusionBuilding an iOS Application with VIPER provides clean architecture paradigm by dividing the responsibilities of each app layer into separate component that makes our application becomes modular between the view logic and business logic, also it is an advantage in large scale application to be able to make our component modular so we can add more features more easily.One of the main disadvantage of VIPER is that there is too many boilerplate code we need to write for each components protocols, which is an overkill in small application. At last, the decision whether to use VIPER or not in our project will depend on our project scale, how familiar our team on using it, and our app specific use cases.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["iOS", "Viper", "Application Architecture", "iOS App Development", "Clean Architecture"]}, {"title": "How we develop using VIPER architecture in iOS", "post_link": "https://m.oursky.com/viper-ios-app-beyond-mvc-mega-viewcontroller-e2b625ac58d5?source=search_post", "author_name": "Oursky", "author_link": "https://m.oursky.com/@oursky", "publish_date": "2015-05-19", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-06", "readtime": "4.58", "claps": 32, "voters": 28, "content": "How we develop using VIPER architecture in iOSTo fight against MVCs (Mega-ViewControllers)OurskyFollowMay 19, 2015 \u00b7 5 min readThe MVC (Model-view-controller) paradigm is a default way in developing iOS applications. However, that default \u201cViewController\u201d messes up Views and Controllers. The developer usually introduces both view animations and business logic in a single UIViewController. It all feeds into a MEGA-ViewController. The massive ViewController actually violates the original MVC design that views are not supposed to have direct access to models.In this post, we will share our experience on how VIPER saves our lives from the MVC monster in our projects. In part two, We\u2019ve also included an example of a SignUpViewController.The \u201cMVC\u201d monsterWhat is VIPER?For smaller scale applications (with less model and UI interactions), MVCs should not be a nightmare. However, imagine we are building a slightly more complex application that includes several models and live UI updates. This makes the typical view controllers massive and difficult to test.VIPER is not a framework but an approach to iOS application architecture that remains clean with complex applications. It stands for:ViewInteractorPresenterEntityRouting (Wireframe)Each component bears a single responsibility, hence developers are forced to write corresponding logics inside each component without messing up view and business logic codes.VIPER is an architecture based on the Single Responsibility Principle. This is how the components working together to build up the application flow:VIEWA View should consist of views and view controllers. It is responsible to receive user interactions and pass them to presenters for decision making. The View should not contain any view logics to keep it simple. This is where you define how the view looks like, and include nothing (NO error checking, NO data fetching) beyond the view appearance .PRESENTERPresenters define the view logics, such as when to show a warning message or highlight a button. It is responsible for preparing content for the View to display. Whenever data is required, the presenter requests data from interactors (but without directly getting it from the model).INTERACTORInteractors mainly contain business logic, such as logging in the user, processing a purchase, or sending a friend request. It should be independent of the UI. It only handles requests from the presenter and prepares corresponding data regardless of how the View looks.ENTITYEntities are the model objects manipulated by an Interactor and only by the Interactor. It can be simply an NSManagedObject. It is model orientated and therefore should not contain any business logic. Something like [User loginWith: (NSString*) name password: (NSString*)password] is not supposed to be placed inside an Entity.ROUTING (WIREFRAME)Routing has a special role in VIPER architecture. It tells where UI Navigation should go. It defines the routes from one screen to another as wireframes. In VIPER, the responsibility for Routing is shared between the presenters and the wireframes.When a presenter receives user interactions and there is a need to navigate to another screen, it will \u201cask\u201d the wireframe to perform the desired navigation to a screen. The wireframe can also specify transition animations if needed.What does VIPER help us achieve?Quick answer: VIPER breaks down complex logical structures into layers of well-defined responsibilities.And yes, we did this in the early architecture design phase.If MVC is a mega-monster that troubles you, VIPER is a little-monster-collection that aids you in building iOS apps \u2014 in a more delightful and controllable way.Now, we can prevent the Mega-ViewControllers from growing and messing up our codebase.By separating responsibilities, it also enhances isolating dependencies. This makes testing and debugging much easier. Since the physical files are becoming smaller and puts more focus on their corresponding responsibilities , it facilitates team collaboration.Part Two: Example SignupViewControllerTo help illustrate how we work with VIPER, in this example, we would like to show how we define components for a signup page.When an app has a first launch, we have a SignupViewController as the rootViewController of AppDelegate.ViewThis shows the login / signup view. It\u2019s only responsible for showing the UI elements and receiving interactions.Login PageSign up PagePresenter@interface LoginPresenter- (void)loginButtonTapped:(NSString *)email password:(NSString *)password;@end@protocol LoginPresenterProtocol- (void)showErrorMessage:(NSString *)message;@endInteractor@protocol LoginInteractorProtocol <NSObject>- (void)requestSuccess;- (void)requestFailed:(NSString *)errorMessage;@end@interface LoginInteractor : NSObject <ETRequestManagerProtocol>- (id)init:(NSString *)emailpassword:(NSString *)passworddelegate:(id<LoginInteractorProtocol>)delegate;- (void)startRequest;@endWireframe@interface WireFrame : NSObject- (void)navigateToMainScreen;@endIf you are starting a new project, you may also start with some open-source VIPER generators:pepibumur/viper-module-generatorviper-module-generator - Gem to generate VIPER modules to use them in your Objective-C/Swift projectsgithub.comiSame7/ViperCodeViperCode - A simple OS X App for generating VIPER modules's skeleton to use them in your Objective-C/Swift projects.github.comChecklist \u2014 make sure you\u2019ve implemented VIPER correctlyThis list helps to make sure everything follows the VIPER\u2019s design principle. We hope this will be as useful to you as we find it to be.Views and view controllers receive user interactions and pass them to presenters for decision makingPresenters contain the view logics and prepare content for display and reacting to user inputsPresenters should not know about the existence of all UIViewsInteractors contain business logics and they should be independent of UIEntities are model objects manipulated by InteractorsWireframe is the only place to define screen navigations and their transition animationsCONCLUSIONIf you also find the \u201cMega-ViewController monster\u201d a nightmare for your iOS Application, VIPER might be one of the possible solutions.VIPER is an proposed architecture that components should be defined according to your own use case.We will continue to share our experience in exploring interesting yet useful engineering technologies and tools in the future.

In order to be considered for adoption, the weapon must weigh less than six pounds unloaded, fire 600 rounds per minute and have a 30-to-60-round magazine capacity. The weapon also had to be able to fit the No. 5 sword bayonet.In 1945, Derek Alfred Hutton-Williams designed a submachine gun he called the Viper. Hutton-Williams\u2019 submachine gun met almost all of the General Staff\u2019s specifications.While impressively fast-firing, the Viper entered a crowded field of similar weapons and never managed to, ahem, sink its fangs into the market.The Viper weighed for pounds, 14 ounces, but its cyclic rate was 692 rounds-per-minute. The Viper, chambered in nine-by-19 millimeter, fed from 32-round MP40 magazines that loaded at the front of the receiver.The magazine acted as an extension of the weapon\u2019s pistol grip, which also housed the magazine well. The Viper had a push-button combination safety and fire-selector with full and semi-automatic settings. The trigger mechanism allowed the Viper to fire single shots with a half-pull when set to fully automatic.Royal Armouries photoHutton-Williams\u2019 design allowed troops to fire the Viper one-handed with a detachable stock designed to tuck under the arm for support. The Viper prototype was accompanied by three different barrels with varying lengths including 4.7 inches, six inches and 7.5 inches.The weapon\u2019s overall length varied, measuring 21.4 inches with the shortest barrel. The Viper also had an enlarged trigger guard to allow users to alsowear thick gloves. The Viper\u2019s sights consisted of a simple rear peep and a protected front sight.Hutton-Williams produced at least two prototypes. The British military showed little interest in Hutton-Williams\u2019 design and rejected the Viper before its designer could make further improvements.By 1945, the British military had over a dozen machine carbine designs to choose from. Many, like the Viper, were quickly rejected. Production of the improved STEN Mk. V was in full swing by the end of the war. The Sterling submachine gun followed in 1953.Hutton-Williams later served as the Deputy Director of Housing at the Ministry of Supply before later acting as superintendent of the Royal Small Arms Factory, Enfield and the director general of Britain\u2019s Royal Ordnance Factories. He retired in 1975 and died in 2001 at the age of 87.Originally published at Historical Firearms.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Submachine Gun", "Guns", "WIB History"]}, {"title": "Comparing MVVM and Viper architectures: When to use one or the other", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@auth0/comparing-mvvm-and-viper-architectures-when-to-use-one-or-the-other-4da139520858?source=search_post", "author_name": "Auth0", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@auth0", "publish_date": "2016-10-04", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-20", "readtime": "0.63", "claps": 60, "voters": 11, "content": "Comparing MVVM and Viper architectures: When to use one or the otherAuth0FollowOct 4, 2016 \u00b7 1 min readA well-designed architecture is important to keep a project maintainable in the long term.

The jet-fighter stand-off is spillover from Russia\u2019s continuing annexation of Ukraine\u2019s strategic Crimean peninsula\u2014and Moscow\u2019s implied threat to the rest of Ukraine and to other states in the region.The U.S., French and British air forces have deployed or will soon deploy contingents of fighter planes to Lithuania and Poland, both of which are NATO members. Meanwhile Russia has sent fighters to Belarus.\u201cWe\u2019re in this with you, together,\u201d U.S. Vice Pres. Joe Biden said on March 19 after a meeting with the presidents of Lithuania and Latvia\u2014the latter also a NATO member. Biden said that America is \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to defending its allies.Moscow matched Washington\u2019s rhetoric in a U.N. meeting the same day. A Russian diplomat said his government was \u201cconcerned\u201d about the rights and safety of Russian-speakers in Estonia, a NATO state.The \u201cconcern\u201d claim is an unambiguous threat. Moscow began annexing Crimea in late February after insisting Ukraine had mistreated the country\u2019s Russophones. Previously, Russia had invaded Georgia and Moldova on the same pretense.American F-15 pilots in Lithuania. Air Force photoWith Russian troops bloodlessly evicting Ukrainian forces in Crimea, NATO responded by reinforcing its aerial patrols along the Russian border. The U.S. Air Force sent an extra six F-15C Eagle fighters to join four F-15s already deployed in Lithuania, which lacks high-performance fighters of its own. The American air arm also expanded a previously-planned air exercise with Poland involving U.S. and Polish F-16C Vipers and other warplanes.The U.S. Air Forces in Europe, the Pentagon\u2019s main air command for the continent, possesses around 200 warplanes, largely based in the U.K., Germany and Italy. Since the Ukraine crisis began, 10 percent of those planes have shifted east toward Russia.Russia met the American fighters with fighters of its own. Six Russian air force Su-27 Flanker fighters with live air-to-air missiles staged in Belarus at the request of the country\u2019s president.Meanwhile, the U.K. and France have both offered to expand NATO\u2019s Baltic air patrols with British Typhoon and, presumably, French Rafale fighters. Finland, which is not a NATO member but loosely aligns with the treaty organization, is increasing the pace of its own aerial patrols near Russia. \u201cWe\u2019re adjusting our own readiness,\u201d Finnish air force Col. Ossi Siv\u00e9n said.Despite the deployments, no one expects air-to-air battles over Europe any time soon.

I then started sharing thoughts with my colleague Marco. He is on the Android side of things, but we needed to discuss to find common ground and both get to a consistent result.We \u201ckind of\u201d failed and ended up with something really similar to VIPER, but! This revisited version of VIPER is what I\u2019m currently using in my applications, so I wouldn\u2019t consider it a failed attempt. More like a custom version of VIPER.Along this path I learned so many things about architectures that I decided to share the experience with a series of articles. There are two things I\u2019d like to focus on:\u2022The decisions taken to get to a complete architecture, highlighting rationale and doubts (some of which are still there)\u2022The architecture I ended up with, showing code and some practical examples.From now on let\u2019s call this structure VIPER-S. The S here stands for Semantic, since I tried to obtain a clearer way to name things, giving more significance to roles and communication, and adding some rules that improve code readability and writing.LET\u2019S ARCHITECTLet\u2019s start this journey with a question. Why do we need an architecture? This question has many different answers but the most relevant are:\u2022To have a clear understanding of our code (and simplify its maintenance)\u2022To easily distribute responsibilities (and simplify team working)\u2022To improve testability (and simplify your life)With these answers in mind, and moved by a profound sense of purpose, we can start planning our architecture.I\u2019m a big fan of \u201cdivide-et-impera\u201d: to me it\u2019s a way of life. That\u2019s why I\u2019d start by identifying all the domains and roles, the actors that are going to work on these domains and how those actors communicate with each other. Those elements are going to define the pillars of our architecture so it\u2019s really important to have a clear understanding of what they are.A domain is a big set that contains all the logic for an area of responsibility. A role is a little part of this set, which is more specific and identifies a precise need. An actor is a code element that implements all the functions to satisfy a role.Let\u2019s list and describe the domains and roles that I\u2019ve identified to build VIPER-S.ARCHITECTURE DOMAINS: USER INTERFACEWith the User Interface domain we show information to the users and we interact with them. Let\u2019s see the roles for this domain.ROLE: DISPLAY UI INFORMATIONThis is a really \u201cdumb\u201d role. The data reaching this domain is ready to use and there\u2019s no need to work on it any further. It only needs to be sent down to the final UI elements, with functions like this:func display (date:String){ label.text = date }As you can see, the date property has probably been converted from Date to String in a previous step. We only display the ready-to-use information here. A label displays a String, so we expect to receive a String.ROLE: HANDLE UI EVENTSThis is another not-too-pro-active role, in fact we only intercept user interactions or application lifetime events here. The actor responsible for this role is generally called within a UI target-action:@IBAction func save(){ eventsHandler.onSave() }ARCHITECTURE DOMAINS: DATAThe Data domain is where we obtain information from a source and we transform it to be presented later, or, alternatively, where we process a user action into something that can be stored somewhere or used somehow. Here are the roles for the Data domain.ROLE: MANAGE DATALet\u2019s imagine this role as a set of one or more workers that are responsible of handling specific jobs. They only know how to get their jobs done and they notify someone else when they have completed or failed an operation.Here is a simple (unsafe) example of a function for this role:func fetchItems() {    networkManager.get(at: itemsPath){    (completed, items) in      if (completed){        presenter.present(items: items)     }      else {        presenter.presentItemFetchError()      }    } }A worker is fetching items using a network manager. It knows exactly how to use the manager, but it doesn\u2019t work with any value coming from the network, it just passes the value to an object that in turn knows how to present it.ROLE: PRESENT DATALet\u2019s remind ourselves not to confuse presenting with displaying: when we present the information we transform it into something that will be displayed through the UI later. The object that implements this role, is often called from the Manage Data role. Returning to the previous example for the user interface, we are not setting the text value of the label here. Instead, we are transforming a Date into a readable String.func present(date:Date){    let dateString = date.localizedString(\u201cYYYY-mm-dd\u201d)       ui.display(date:dateString) }ARCHITECTURE DOMAIN: NAVIGATIONThis domain has a single role: handling the navigation for the App. The logic behind how to display the \u201cnext view\u201d is entirely handled within this role and the same is true for its initialization and dismissal. We then need to use UIKit to work with Storyboards and call all the needed default iOS navigation functions.func navigateToDetail(\u2018for\u2019 item:Item) {    let itemDetail = ItemDetailNavigator.makeModule(with: item)    push(nextViewController: itemDetail) }In this example the navigator is building the module (more on this term later \u2014 just look at it as a ViewController for now) that we are going to present and it pushes it to the current navigation stack.COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DOMAINSLet\u2019s now introduce the \u201cdirector\u201d, the first actor for the architecture. We are going to see its code in detail later. For now let\u2019s just talk about it as the way to build a bridge between the domains we just saw.The director is responsible of driving the flow of information from UI events to data handling and from data handling back to the UI. It is also responsible of defining when navigation has to take place. Each operation starts from the director and each result of the operation, at some point, passes through it.Let\u2019s check the overview of the architecture discussed so far to better understand how communication happens:All those arrows\u2026 but trust me, the flow is easier than it looks. Here is a real-life example: when a user taps the save button, the application has to save some information and display a dialog with a success message (or an error in case something goes wrong).The flow will start from the left of the previous image from \u201chandle events\u201d. The user tap is intercepted and passed to the director. The director sends the information to the object responsible for the role \u201cmanage data\u201d. When this object completes the operation it\u2019s ready to present the result to the director which, at this point, is sending the information back to the UI domain which in turn knows how to display it. Now let\u2019s say that at the end of the saving operation, instead of presenting a popup we\u2019d rather go to another page. Easy. The director, instead of moving the flow to the UI domain, can just drive it to the Navigation.LET\u2019S CODEIt\u2019s now finally time to translate the architecture logic into code!Before starting this process we need to identify the required modules for the example we are going to implement. What\u2019s a module, though? The architecture considers a module what we can simply call a \u201cPage\u201d or a \u201cView\u201d of the application. This means that for an application where you can list, display and add items you have 3 modules. With the MVC architecture, for instance, each module would be a view controller.Let\u2019s introduce the example of code that we will implement with these tutorials. We are writing an application to handle generic \u201cItems\u201d that can be enabled or disabled. An Item has a name, a creation date and a state (enabled or disabled). We are going to implement 3 modules to handle items: \u201cItems List\u201d, \u201cAdd Item\u201d and \u201cItem Detail\u201d. Adding to the above the welcome pages, we have a total of 4 modules divided in 2 groups: Items and General.ORGANIZE YOUR PROJECTI\u2019m a messy guy, so I need a strict schema to follow when I\u2019m working on a big project. For VIPER-S I decided to have a very clear folder structure. This is part of defining the architecture, after all.Each module group has a root folder. In this case \u201cGeneral\u201d and \u201cItems\u201d (I\u2019d rather create real folders for the module groups, not just the Xcode project folders). Each module has its own folder. For Items we have \u201cAdd\u201d, \u201cList\u201d and \u201cDetail\u201d and for \u201cGeneral\u201d just \u201cWelcome\u201d.This is the current folder structure for the project:Each file and class follows a simple naming convention: prefixed using the folder structure that contains it, and then named after its specialization. For example, the director of the List module for Items is called \u201cItemsListDirector.swift\u201d and the class name is \u201cItemsListDirector\u201d. This will be really useful when used with autocomplete. When you start writing \u201cList\u2026\u201d you\u2019ll get all the classes for this group. Then \u201c\u2026Add\u201d to get only classes for ListAdd module. It\u2019s a really handy convention!We\u2019ll discuss other naming conventions later. This is just a simple rule that creates a shared logic for name definition and project organization. It\u2019s a life-saver if you, like me, are not really good at keeping your naming style unchanged over the course of very long projects.THE CONTRACT AND PROTOCOLS DEFINITIONLet\u2019s begin by writing a contract that describes the architecture for each module through protocols. A contract is the part of the architecture where you can define precisely what a module does. It\u2019s a sort of documentation for the module.We\u2019ll start from the \u201cItems List\u201d module, translating the roles previously described into protocols. For this module we know that it shows the list of \u201citems\u201d through a table and it has a \u201cdelete all\u201d button to flush all the available items.The \u201cDisplay UI\u201d role has to display items, errors and success messages. A good protocol to describe this role would be:protocol ItemList_DisplayUI {  func display(items: [ItemUI])   func display(error:String)   func displaySuccess() }The itemUI is a base object defined by simple types like String, UIImage or Bool. We\u2019ll discuss it later. All the functions that update UI elements with a UI model are prefixed with the \u201cdisplay\u201d word. Being really strict in the naming convention is important, because I don\u2019t want to have doubts like \u201cshould I call this function \u2018show\u2019, \u2018display\u2019, \u2018update\u2019 WAT?!\u201d. All the protocols have a predefined set of verbs/keywords to use.Note: here is another little naming convention that I\u2019m using. Considering we will end up with a considerable number of files and classes for a single module, I found it useful to differentiate protocols from classes. That\u2019s why I\u2019m putting an underscore between the module name and the role name, obtaining the protocol name (ItemList_DisplayUI). Trust me, you\u2019ll love this little trick later, when you write your own code and you want to autocomplete a class or a protocol name quickly.The \u201cHandle UI events\u201d role has 3 functions: it has to say when the UI is ready (i.e. when viewDidLoad is called), it has to trigger an event when the user taps the \u201cDelete All\u201d button, and another event when an item is selected from the table.protocol ItemsList_HandleUIEvents {  func onUIReady()  func onDeleteAll()  func onItemSelected(index:Int)}In general, the functions for this role start with the prefix \u201con\u201d followed by the name of the handled event.Let\u2019s move on to the Data domain. The first role is \u201cManage Data\u201d and it has 2 functions: fetch the items and delete all the items.protocol ItemsList_ManageData{ func fetchItems() func deleteAllItems() }The second role is \u201cPresent Data\u201d. With this role we want to present items when available and we could also present generic success or error messages.protocol ItemsList_PresentData{  func present(items:[Item])  func presentSuccess()  func presentError() }Personally I love this notation and and I find it extremely readable. The verb \u201cpresent\u201d is prefix to all the protocol functions.The Navigation domain\u2019s only role is \u201cNavigate\u201d. From the ItemsList module we know that we can select an item and see its detail in a dedicate view. We can also go back to the Welcome view, or more generically, we can just go back to the previous view.protocol ItemsList_Navigate{  func gotoDetail(\u2018for\u2019 item:Item)  func goBack() }Functions for the navigate protocol are prefixed with \u201cgo/goto\u201d.protocol ItemsList_Navigate{  func gotoDetail(`for` item:Item)  func goBack() }This is the full code of the ItemsListProtocol.swift file. As you can see, if you know each role\u2019s functionality you can easily understand what this module does:protocol ItemList_DisplayUI {    func display(items: [ItemUIModel])    func displayError()    func displaySuccess()} protocol ItemsList_HandleUIEvents {    func onUIReady()    func onDeleteAll()    func onItemSelected(index: Int)} protocol ItemsList_ManageData{     func fetchItems()    func deleteAllItems()} protocol ItemsList_PresentData{     func present(items:[Item])    func presentSuccess()    func presentError()} protocol ItemsList_Navigate{    func gotoDetail(`for` item:Item)    func goBack()}This concludes part one of the series. In the coming parts we\u2019ll dive deeper into the architecture\u2019s code, writing all the actors involved. We\u2019ll complete the ItemList module and we\u2019ll talk about how to handle some specific patterns like passing information to another module (i.e. when you select an Item and you navigate to the detail page) and getting information from another module (i.e. when you add a new Item in the ItemsAdd module and you need to notify the ItemsList module to refresh the list).Thanks for reading this far and stay tuned for the next installments in the series.

I wasn\u2019t very well known (arguably not now either, before you shout) but I was a visible or audible Muslim presence on our national broadcaster. I never intended it to be that way, these things just sort of happen. It was an enjoyable time as I\u00a0tried to balance community activism, charity work, my equalities consulting and family life. I had just taken a six-figure settlement from my former employer, signed a confidentiality agreement and gone on my way. I had become a self-funded super-community organiser, doing everything from painting the mosque, to building cabinets, organising conferences, tidying the shoes, chaplaincy and counselling, school governance, public speaking, education, supporting a trans-charity, training and engagement for faith communities. I didn\u2019t say no to anything. No task was too small. None too big. It was my way of helping to fix the world a little bit.All the whilst, I never shied away from my Islamic identity. The beard. The robes. The hat. A selection of natty scarves. It was all part of who I genuinely felt myself to be at the time and an expression of my faith. Presumably due to the higher profile broadcasting work, I\u00a0was contacted by an employee of the BBC and forwarded, confidentially, an exchange of e-mails between BBC senior managers and staff. In these emails, senior management were being challenged by staff over anti-Muslim policies. It was apparent that within the organisation, news teams and staff were aware that there was in place a policy to refuse to employ women who wore the headscarf, particularly for front of camera positions. When I became aware of these emails, having checked with the whistle-blower and agreeing to anonymity, I contacted three people: someone who works on BBC Five Live, a producer in the Newsnight team and a BBC national news journalist and presenter who focuses on ethnic minority reporting. All three of these individuals are senior people, at least two of whom are award-winning broadcast journalists. All still work for the organisation.In that email exchange I was sent on the matter of women and\u00a0head coverings, senior management stated the following:individuals who hold that point of view should not be watching or working for an international news broadcaster like the BBCWith the use of that phrase \u2018watching or working for\u2019\u00a0it clearly wasn\u2019t enough to merely limit the progression and opportunities for these kinds of Muslim women, but if you wanted to get on, take the scarf off. Even more sinister was the suggestion that the world\u2019s largest broadcaster, was seeking to deter orthodox mainstream Muslims (the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Britain hold relatively conservative views) from within its viewership. That\u2019s quite a staggering idea.Also within that email was something of an unusual invitation to the news staff.I would encourage you to make sure you come to one of the staff awaydays that I am currently holding every Monday and Wednesday\u2026\u00a0After that you will be in a better position to decide if it is the kind of channel where your skills are best employedI laugh every time I read it. It sounds like something from a John Morton script for\u00a0Twenty Twelve\u00a0with Hugh Bonneville and\u00a0Jess Hynes. Or probably more accurately now,\u00a0W1A. In any modern corporate setting in the UK, staff have to learn to read between the lines. It would be reasonable to assume that any of the staff seeking to challenge the \u201cno-hijab policy\u201d would be asked to leave the organisation, forced out, or in the very least have their card marked. The BBC senior managers involved were clear about\u00a0what sort of output they sought to produce both at that time and in the future. It was a BBC future that\u00a0did not\u00a0include women with hijabs being\u00a0in front of the camera\u2026 or even in their viewership.In my conversations with those BBC journalists, I was keen to make sure that there was no backlash on the whistle-blower and that the issues were addressed. I was interested to know, especially from the Newsnight team at the time, if they were in a position to report on internal racism and corruption, or if there would be pressure to drop the story. These conversations continued well into 2013. From a diversity and inclusion perspective, if the BBC had been managing-out Muslim women with hijabs, or men with beards for that matter, that was a major problem. What was not in doubt, was that senior managers had anti-Muslim policies in place. That there was prejudice. The maximum extent of these policies were unknown; after all, most of an iceberg sits beneath the water. This doesn\u2019t mean they sought to exclude\u00a0allMuslims but rather that the BBC was looking to separate Muslims into two camps (quite regardless of their personal views, or potential extremisms should that be the case) to create a false image to its viewership, which in no way reflects or represents either the staff working for the corporation, or the customers it sought to serve under a BBC Charter. Furthermore, to promote the idea both internally and to the outside world, that certain kinds of Muslims were more acceptable \u2013 more equal\u00a0\u2013 than others. It was a theme that I would come to understand only with the fullness of time.The story, incidentally, never saw the light of day. It was\u00a0spiked. I\u2019m lead to believe from other sources that the senior managers were moved on \u2013 without sanction.After my BBC documentary spending eighteen months with the domestic far right, we had managed to facilitate Tommy leaving the EDL. It had taken best part of a year to figure out how. On the one hand Tommy was concerned that he couldn\u2019t earn a living and no one would give him a job.\u00a0The only solution was to broker a financial deal between him and the UK government. He had to turn supergrass and give up the far right. He had to denounce extremism. More of this later. My subsequent media profile meant that I was now beginning to more and more regularly be put under pressure from senior people in the UK media landscape, journalists and in particular from one person at the BBC,\u00a0Savile\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, to alter my views. He would send me books on atheism and science from anti-theists ordered from Amazon. He was constantly emailing and messaging. He was bringing me into his inner circle. Even to this day, I don\u2019t know how systems within the corporatiom work but there would be weekly phone calls with Radio Wales, Five Live, regional and national programs. It was a constant stream of requests for my punditry. In early 2014, things came to a head as the\u00a0pressure mounted.The more I learned about the Quilliam Foundation and work of Maajid Nawaz \u2013 both of whom I had been rather ambivalent towards \u2013 the more I was having a problem with it. Spying on Muslims. Othering them. Bullying and harassing people. Being gatekeepers. Supporting Muslim haters. Taking dirty money and not disclosing it. Broken policies feeding extremism in government. Deciding who was and wasn\u2019t OK as a Muslim\u00a0\u2013\u00a0that some were more equal than others and that the overwhelming majority of Muslims had to change. This was brutal, intolerant and wrong. That\u2019s not how we do things in Britain,\u00a0is it?\u00a0A few times, I had stayed up virtually all night with Adil Ray in debate about these things. Adil was clear. He wanted to change Islam. So did Maajid, who was his friend. My argument was that we had to change Muslims, to a more authentic and accurate reading of Islam \u2013 this is about spiritual renewal and renovation. We don\u2019t get to mess around with the core texts. We don\u2019t get to reform Islam. As most Muslims will testify, Islam is itself considered complete; it was in fact the reformation of Judaism and Christianity. There was one chain of Prophets, one message and a series of texts. Islam completed the theological jigsaw puzzle. Simples. We don\u2019t get to change it. If people are ignorant \u2013 both Muslims and non-Muslims alike, we educate them.Adil was certain, there was an Islam where you detach beliefs from behaviours, and he and Maajid were going to promote that. I simply couldn\u2019t agree. Despite my support for the early stages of his program Citizen Khan and going to the Pump Room for the first set of rehearsals, and my early sympathies with the efforts of Quilliam; these guys now seemed to be nasty pieces of work. I couldn\u2019t understand why they weren\u2019t just happy to live their lives and let other people live theirs. Why were they crossing the road to my side, to tell me and people like me, we were doing things wrong? With disrespect not entirely unintended, they were ignorant, intolerant and as it now transpired, Citizen Khan was nothing more than a vehicle for main-streaming their agenda. When Matthew Wright, Kevin O\u2019Sullivan and me were slating the program and its racism on social media, Savile\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 jumped in to send private messages to Matthew, warning him to stay away from me. To Matthew\u2019s credit he hasn\u2019t done and he subsequently told me that it was one thing to be told lies, another thing to believe them. I always liked him; a good Catholic boy.On Newsnight, Mehdi Hasan and me took on Maajid and made it clear that there was a total and utter rejection from Muslim communities up and down the country, over Quilliam\u2019s (and his) views, policies and practices. However, I was learning that there was a deep agenda here. And Muslims rejected it. The likes of Adil Ray, kept their agenda hidden and instead talked about traditions of comedy. That wasn\u2019t his intention as far as I was concerned, and the conversations we had before his program came out. It was also becoming clear that this agenda had supporters \u2013 media sponsors \u2013 who were going to do\u00a0whatever\u00a0they could to bring Muslims from the mainstream body of communities to join their ranks. To get people to sell-out.There was an exchange of SMS texts between me and Savile\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 . I had said that I was not going to change my view of Islam. I knew who I was, where I was from, and what I was about. I\u2019d been forwarded emails from other Muslims who were doing television regularly and it was evident that he had been trying to draw people in to support his agenda and Quilliam. He was just copying and pasting the same messages to each of us. Lazy. Crap. In my texts, I told him that\u00a0his attitude had changed and that I wasn\u2019t going along with it. This was about my view of my religion and I wasn\u2019t interested in supporting their agenda. He was good friends with a Times journalist who I had met for lunch and with whom I was familiar. Both of them had began to turn the screws.Within a matter of days, soon after my film with Russell Brand, a smear campaign was launched across print, online and social media channels. At the heart of it,\u00a0Savile\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 had been working with (at this point I\u2019m not sure what to call them, they\u2019re certainly not journalists, so let\u2019s call them\u00a0paki-bashing smear mongers) to create a repository of false information to use against me. He then feigned surprise when I was falsely \u2018outed\u2019 as some kind of charlatan. Dirty tricks, by even dirtier people. This was done in conjunction with the same BBC figure going out of his way to contact broadcasters, newsreaders, radio presenters, even trainee researchers contacting me on Twitter \u2013 to tell them to stay away. To put me out in the cold. To disenfranchise me. Sadly for this person, people have come forward to tell me. I remember during one television news discussion, as we went to the break, the news presenter turned to me and saidwhy is <Savile\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9> looking to smear you with all this information.. he\u2019s been sending me all kinds of private messagesWe later corresponded and I told him to send me what he had. There really wasn\u2019t a lot of time during a 2 minute break to discuss matters fully. But he knew it was bullshit. That was a start.I met Bob Shennan on a sunny morning in his office next to Chris Evans\u2019 studio at Western House on Gildea St. It was totally rock and roll with gold discs adorning the walls and memorabilia everywhere. A genuinely cool office and unlike any of the other BBC\u2019s corporate spaces. I sat there in my Muslimy robes and hat. He and Mark Strippel had agreed to meet with me to discuss the blacklists that were being run inside the BBC. I had wanted to know how they operated and what they were going to do to stop them from being used. I had wanted to know why Bobby Friction was supporting Maajid Nawaz and abusing and harassing me on social media. There must be policies,\u00a0right?\u00a0I had wanted to know what was being done. The smear campaign had been going on for months and from weekly phone ins on BBC Asian Network, Five Live and Radio Wales, there was now nothing. Bob had previously written to me as Controller of\u00a0BBC Radio 2, 6 Music and Asian Network. We had been corresponding for a few months and were on reasonably good terms. At the end of 2014, Bob had given assurances sayingthere is absolutely no sense that you are being excluded from our News outputHe had promised\u00a0that there were no blacklists operating and that normal service would be resumed. I had made it clear that there were several BBC staff on television and radio, some with central contracts and who were freelancers, others making programs and connected to the organisation through production companies, that were involved in a harassment campaign which was designed to disseminate false information about me. That this was connected to my faith (and potentially race) and was designed to cause reputational harm and to marginalise me. Bob\u2019s comments were\u00a0pretty hard to rationalise, since for the majority of that year, and since\u00a0Savile\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and the cabal of interests on the Right (the\u00a0Paki-bashing smear mongers), had decided that as a lefty Muslim who wasn\u2019t going to compromise his faith for them and join their club, I was going to be smeared, harassed and chased out of town. Apparently, there\u00a0were\u00a0policies; freelancers not directly employed by the BBC could use social media in their own right \u2013 even to smear, defame and harass. That also meant by extension, BBC staff using BBC connected accounts without any disclaimers would be in serious problems.Clearly the organisation and its scale meant that Controller Bob had to rely on Mark and an uncontrollable raft of producers and editors to do the right thing \u2013 to make sure there was no manifestation, continuation and extension of the harassment campaign. Since Bob had given assurances,\u00a0why weren\u2019t staff doing the right thing?I had been waiting, like an idiot lover being stood up in the restaurant munching bread-sticks at the bar, for the BBC to do the right thing. To lift the embargo. There was clearly one in place \u2013 even the Twitter trolls were revelling in it. On the plus side, it was nice to bump into Claudia Winkleman that day. She is as lovely as you might imagine. And quite tiny.By 2015, the documentary evidence had been compiled into a dossier on\u00a0Savile\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9. HR had been shown a copy, and meetings had taken place. There had been numerous conversations with Kully Khaila who had taken over as the Executive Editor of Sunday Morning Live when it stopped being made in Belfast and moved to what is the new One Show studios at New Broadcasting House. There had been emails to Helen Boaden, who was at the time Director of BBC News, then becoming Director of BBC Radio. There were several letters. They included the complaints about the harassment campaign, later also\u00a0the dossier of evidence, and made clear reference to the fact that BBC Trust and Compliance were covering-up this anti-Muslim corruption and were refusing to disclose evidence. The BBC was circling its wagons around \u201ctalent\u201d.I did what you\u2019re meant to do \u2013 contact BBC Trust. File complaints. Fill out reports. Pay fees for Data Protection disclosures.\u00a0They had information relating to me as a contracted BBC contributor. I was entitled to that. They had evidence relating to anti-Muslim corruption, harassment and defamation. I was entitled to that. They refused to give it. In a galactically ballsy move, they actually wrote out and say it didn\u2019t fall within the scope of the Data Protection Act.We are an incredibly busy unit and although your SAR was a priority we were unable to solely devote the time it demanded to reach the conclusion that the information did not fall within scope of the Act.In a following\u00a0letter to BBC Director Helen Boaden, I had told her the following:It appears that producers, presenters or other staff, as previously suspected, have been ostensibly maintaining a blacklist (whether written or otherwise), which still persists. This provides an explanation as to why, aside from this week, I have not been used at all by AN in 2014, despite Bob Shennan\u2019s assurance in January that my relationship with AN would improve in \u201ccoming months\u201d.There are a number of deeply offensive and inaccurate narratives in the public sphere relating to me \u2013 and I appreciate that this is a thing people in the public eye must face \u2013 but if there was any significant question relating to my credibility, I would expect to be either invited in for a coffee and to discuss matters as a professional courtesy, or to be contacted in some other way to offer and opportunity to respond. The BBC must be more robust than to allow personal agendas and smear campaigns to influence programming. At the same time, after my public condemnation of the Woolwich attacks, my family and I have suffered a great deal. I have continued to be outspoken, at some personal cost.There are too few Muslim commentators in an increasingly difficult and rarefied sector but for BBC employees to be effectively maintaining blacklists, contrary to senior management assurances, and for them to be collaborating to undermine my reputation and credibility to remove my public platform, is a grave matter and a breach of the public trust.I appreciate the pressures on your time, in particular with efficiencies that need to be delivered, however I believe this sufficiently serious such that you will investigate matters as a matter of urgency.Yours faithfully,Mohammed AnsarAlso included to Helen Boaden was a copy of my letter to BBC Information Policy and Compliance.\u00a0It stated the following, making clear why information didn\u2019t meet the\u00a0exemptions under s32, and that they had to, by law, give me that disclosure.Thank you for your letter dated today.Below is a summary of the correspondence and Data Protection Act / FOIA disclosure requests sent to the BBC.7th May 2014 \u2013\u00a0email to BBC Trust,\u00a0complaint relating to the misconduct of {redacted}8th May 2014 \u2013\u00a0email to BBC Data Protection Enquiries team,\u00a0request for DPA disclosure2nd October 2014 \u2013\u00a0complaint emailed to BBC Trust,\u00a0no responses/ disclosures made8th October 2014 \u2013\u00a0complaint emailed to Helen Boaden,\u00a0evidence of further misconduct from\u00a0{redacted}14th January 2015 \u2013\u00a0correspondence with BBC Data Protection Enquiries and BBC Trust team,\u00a0no disclosures made to date, response to s32 defencePrinciple seven of the Data Protection Act which handles \u201cunauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data\u201d is not exempt under s32, which applies to all data processing by the BBC. The s32 exemption applies to personal data \u201cwith a view to publication\u201d.Personal data not subject to a \u201cview to publication\u201d is fully subject to the act and there is no protection under s32 and no exemption applies. Personal data must be processed \u201cfairly and lawfully\u201d. There is significant evidence of behaviour from {redacted} which is commensurate with harassment, defamation or otherwise potentially unlawful behaviour under the Communications Act 2003. Under the Malicious Communications Act 1988 there is no requirement for the message to necessarily reach the recipient; it must merely have been sent, delivered or transmitted. All of this information is subject to Data Protection Act requests and disclosures; furthermore, no exemption under s32 can be applicable.Any exemptions under s32 are only intended to apply up to the point of publication (re: Naomi Campbell case). In the case of the Mentorn production when \u201cTommy Met Mo\u201d, transmission date was October 2013, and so no s32 exemption applies after this date. This area of the law has been rigorously explored and you are, unequivocally, subject to a statutory framework which has been legally tested.I have enclosed for you the following:Letter sent to Helen Boaden, dated 2nd October 2014Dossier of communications issued by {redacted}\u00a0updated January 2015Both of the letter and the dossier contain evidence related to communications from {redacted}\u00a0pertaining specifically to me. The nature of these messages requires you as the Data Controller, to disclose the requested data in full.None of these matters now relate to an issue \u201cup to the point of publication\u201d. They relate to the misconduct and potentially ongoing unlawful conduct of an employee.The BBC has breached the timescales for making disclosures under the DPA and has failed to produce the information at all. Meanwhile, the letter to Ms Boaden shows that the BBC has failed to protect me from harassment by {redacted}.I trust you will provide these disclosures within 7 working days of receipt of this letter.Yours faithfully,Mohammed AnsarOkay accepted, its a bit technical. Only a proper broadcasting twonk might really understand, I guess. The point is that Freedom of Information Act and Data Protection requests, and all the evidence related to that, was not being coughed-up. Even through they had to by law. They had breached statutory time scales. There was just radio silence.There had been meetings with\u00a0Kieron Collins, Editor of BBC Entertainment Production, and BBC Human Resources to stop the harassment. It didn\u2019t stop. Savile\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 later helped put a smear piece in to Private Eye after I refused his bribe \u2013 that he would un-blacklist me and open all the channels if were only to drop things and stay quiet. But to stop the\u00a0ongoingharassment\u00a0and smears, the BBC was going to have to put things back as they were. The One Show had wanted a regular slot from me \u2013 that had since been dropped. There were agreements in principle to film documentaries \u2013 they had disappeared. There was talk of a radio current affairs newspaper review targeted towards the British Asian community \u2013 gone. There were broken promises for meetings with\u00a0Head of News, Kevin Silverton and his team to bring me back from the cold. BBC Trust had failed to address the complaints of harassment. The BBC had effectively, covered up. I guess with Murdoch\u2019s very own James Harding as Head of BBC News,\u00a0what was I expecting?It was time for the BBC to do the right thing and I had been willing to let bygones be bygones. But anti-Muslim corruption was rife and it clearly was a river that ran deep. Senior managers were asked to stop the harassment and to right the wrongs. Pleaded with. Time and again. BBC Trust failed. They had a problem with Muslims or more specifically, certain kinds of Muslims. And not just the screamy shouty extremist ones. The problem was with BBC staff and management that they were letting get away with murder.And all they did was to cover-up and turn the other cheek.Now tell me the BBC doesn\u2019t need fixing.\u00a0Charter Review, anyone?", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Islamophobia", "Journalism", "Media"]}, {"title": "Vyprodal jsem se p\u0159es Bazarobot", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@mjhere/vyprodal-jsem-se-p-es-bazarobot-b68816713d88?source=search_post", "author_name": "Michal Jirak", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@mjhere", "publish_date": "2014-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2014-02-15", "readtime": "1.45", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Vyprodal jsem se p\u0159es Bazarobotaneb zase zkou\u0161\u00edm n\u011bco nov\u00e9hoMichal JirakFollowFeb 15, 2014 \u00b7 2 min readSna\u017e\u00edm se zkou\u0161et st\u00e1le n\u011bco nov\u00e9ho a to mi p\u0159in\u00e1\u0161\u00ed nejen velk\u00fd p\u0159ehled, ale tak\u00e9 hodn\u011b zbyte\u010dn\u00fdch v\u011bc\u00ed.I proto jsme koncept Bazarobotu zva\u017eovali v Mitonu ji\u017e n\u011bkolikr\u00e1t, ale nikdy to ekonomicky nevych\u00e1zelo.

Since my work has a lot to do with the internet and I use it daily, I need to have a solution \u2014 a solution for the great firewall of China. For years (since 2009 to be exact), it was Astrill, but never again!For a long time, Astrill VPN was a solid solution and it still is for many people. In fact, it\u2019s probably still the most popular solution in China, which is the problem. Unfortunately, it has been blocked quite often during the last one or two years. China is becoming stricter about this whole area of internet censorship and one VPN they were really focused on was Astrill (I do not have any proof \u2014 it is just my impression from various web articles, discussions and my own experience). The Astrill team has always been great and they have come up with some solutions. The even made a free Stealth VPN (of their own protocol) for my basic premium subscription, which was working ok for a while.This month as I was redesigning and remaking my webpage, I spent most of my days on the internet and on Astrill. Every day I had to take a few shots of whisky to calm myself down. It was driving me crazy. Everything was super slow, disconnections occurred every ten minutes, my account was blocked a few times because of suspicious activity, etc. In the end, I have decided to give a try to another VPN provider.So, I have started my research. To my great surprise, Astrill didn\u2019t even get a mention in most of the \u201cbest of\u201c reviews on the internet. It is simply not the best solution anymore. I think it is possibly one of the worst solutions now. After reading many articles and reviews, I had two potential winners: VyprVPN and Express VPN. VyprVPN offers a three day trial so I started with that. Outcome: I do not even have to try Express VPN.I am watching 1080HD video on Youtube for the first time in China! I could never have done that with Astrill. With Astrill, I was super happy when 420p was working, but with VyprVPN I can watch 1080HD without interruptions! I have streamed an HD movie with PopcornTime over bitorrents with no problems! I have uploaded hundreds of MBs in minutes. The whole world has changed for me!VyprVPN\u2019s Mac application is on a whole different level. The Astrill application for Mac is a basic solution. It is unstable, and I had to restart it a few times a day; sometimes I even had to restart my Mac because of Astrill. There were times when it acted like I was logged out of my account, but in reality it didn\u2019t log out, making it impossible to log in again (because I was actually logged in even though the app was showing I was logged out). It made my internet speed unusable. VyprVPN is a clean, stable, well-working app and it is also beautiful. Speed tests are available in one click. You can also see your speed history, which is great. They also have a great application for the iPhone as well. I have never succeeded in making the Astrill application for the iPhone work.Apps from VyprVPN just work!!!VyprVPN now offers three kinds of subscription: Basic one, Pro and Premiere. I do not think basic is enough for China so I bought Pro. The Pro subscription offers a special VPN protocol that is especially designed for China and countries with heavy censorship. They call it Chameleon. And the best part? With the Pro subscription, you can get 25GB cloud storage for free! How awesome is that?The Pro subscription with VyprVPN costs USD8.33 for one month if you buy it in a yearly subscription; Astrill costs USD5.83 a month, but if you want to add the NAT firewall (which is included in VyprVPN), you have to add another USD5. I am not sure if StealthVPN is now included or not; they say it both ways on their websites. They gave it to me for free, but it is +USD2 if you want to buy it. So, if you want to have Astrill on the same level as VyprVPN (with the NAT firewall and their own protocol StealthVPN), you have to pay USD12.83 a month. For a lower price with VyprVPN, I get speed, reliability, and a stable app for Mac and the iPhone (and other devices if I wish) and 25GB of free cloud storage. My world has literally changed \u2014 changed to a much brighter one. I will not have a drinking problem anymore because of all this stress that Astrill was causing me.Originally published at www.bamboome.sk.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["VPN", "China", "Great Firewall"]}, {"title": "\u4ed8\u8d39VPN\u63a8\u8350-VyprVPN-19\u5e746\u6708\u53ef\u7528", "post_link": "https://medium.com/vkuajing/%E4%BB%98%E8%B4%B9vpn%E6%8E%A8%E8%8D%90-vyprvpn-19%E5%B9%B46%E6%9C%88%E5%8F%AF%E7%94%A8-68e2d4618bce?source=search_post", "author_name": "Lester", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@lester.y1992", "publish_date": "2019-06-07", "last_modified_date": "2019-06-14", "readtime": "4.91", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "\u4ed8\u8d39VPN\u63a8\u8350-VyprVPN-19\u5e746\u6708\u53ef\u7528LesterFollowJun 7 \u00b7 5 min read\u63a8\u8350\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ed8\u8d39VPN\u8f6f\u4ef6 \u2014 Vyprvpn\u3002\u6700\u8fd1VPN\u53c8\u4e25\u6253\uff0c\u5f88\u591aVPN\u534f\u8bae\u90fd\u591a\u5c11\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6216\u662fIP\u6bb5\u88ab\u5c01\u4e86\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u5f71\u54cd\u6b63\u5e38\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u4f9d\u7136\u53c8\u4e00\u4e2aVPN\u670d\u52a1\u5546\u4e0d\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd \u5c31\u662fVyprvpn\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u66f4\u65b0\u4e8e 2019\u20136\u201350. \u524d\u8a001.

Is this a sign that Brooker, who\u2019s written or co-written every instalment, is running out of fresh ideas? Maybe. But shorter runs should also ensure higher quality, as some stories during Netflix\u2019s era have been more perfunctory. \u201cStriking Vipers\u201d can be viewed as a loose companion to \u201c Playtest\u201d, in how the premise is inspired by where gaming technology could be headed. Although this hour\u2019s more interested in exploring the social impact of VR and how real-life relationships might be affected by its allure.We meet 27-year-old Danny (Anthony Mackie) and his girlfriend Theo (Nicole Beharie) at a nightclub, where they indulge in a roleplay that involves pretending to be strangers meeting for the first time, before dancing the night away and later having sex back at home. But a small crack in their relationship is noted when, during the night, Danny is tempted to play the beat-\u2019em-up video game Striking Vipers (which bears an uncanny resemblance to Street Fighter II and Tekken) with his co-habiting college friend Karl (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II).Jump forward 11 years and Danny\u2019s turned 38 and has a three-year-old with his now-wife Theo, and Karl reenters his life at a barbecue they\u2019re hosting, reconnecting with his old buddy by way of gifting him a copy of a new VR game: Striking Vipers X. After the party, Danny\u2019s invited to play over the network by Karl during the night, they each choose a character, and indulge in some shared gaming nostalgia\u2026 but with the added sensory thrill of now feeling like they\u2019re these imaginary characters. Karl has become the Chun Li-esque \u201cRoxette\u201d (Pom Klementieff), while Danny plays as Ryu analogue \u201cLance\u201d (Ludi Lin). But after a violent round of kicks and punches in VR, Danny is startled when his friend kisses him. Initially shocked and ashamed by what happened in the heat of the moment, Danny and Karl soon begin a tentative online fantasy \u201caffair\u201d that consists of having sex while in-character. However, the secrecy and guilt of their online liaisons slowly affect his marriage to Theo.Like all good Black Mirror episodes, \u201cStriking Vipers\u201d has interesting things to say about how games could affect human behaviour and even challenge our notions of sexuality. The story begins with an already strong idea about two men whose lives went in opposite directions: Danny became a husband and father, every inch the well-adjusted family man, while Karl never found love and instead puts all his time and energy into playing games when he\u2019s not banging a hot young girlfriend he can no longer satisfy beneath the sheets.Even without the introduction of VR sex, there\u2019s an enjoyable tale here about how men don\u2019t totally outgrow their childhood, while some get stuck there. The bond of friendship is even strong enough to challenge true love and, for Karl, he perhaps started to misconstrue companionship for deeper emotions and connections missing from his own life. Danny, on the other hand, is more a victim of a midlife crisis, feeling trapped by his situation at home with a family, so VR is a tempting way to escape without much likelihood of being caught. And when you can have virtual sex that\u2019s indistinguishable from the real thing, but with whoever your fantasy partner might be from the world of games, both men\u2019s flaws played into what Striking Vipers could provide them.I certainly enjoyed \u201cStriking Vipers\u201d as I like to watch Black Mirror without reading synopses or watching any trailers, so it\u2019s fun just to see where the story\u2019s going to take things. But I don\u2019t think the story went anywhere particularly unexpected and it ended up resolving things in a shrug-worthy way. Everyone found a way to accept their odd compulsions and fantasies, manage them in mutually beneficial ways \u2014 although it\u2019s easy to imagine the situation deteriorating in a future the episode doesn\u2019t show us. Maybe Brooker\u2019s going soft in his own middle-age?There\u2019s a strong portrayal of modern-day marriage and parenthood, too, which deftly touched on dynamics familiar to most people \u2014 particularly how old friendships can be compelling links to more carefree times older adults long to return to. There was also some interesting exploration about how interactive porn might cause users to reconsider their own sexuality, even if you know the \u201cgirl\u201d you\u2019re shagging is actually your male best friend \u2014 who is of no sexual interest outside of the game\u2019s fantasy trappings. Indeed, even today, people openly pretend to be the opposite sex or anthropomorphised creatures, in MMORPGs.But despite its ability to provoke questions and stir thoughts, \u201cStriking Vipers\u201d was middling Black Mirror. The technology here wasn\u2019t showing us anything new, it was more a chance to have fun staging photorealistic beat-\u2019em-up characters against stylized backgrounds. The situation that arose from the existence of interactive VR porn, with its twisted \u2018friends-with-benefits\u2019 angle, was entertaining to watch go down\u2026 but it didn\u2019t take is anywhere very unexpected. The story also stretched the material. It\u2019s fortunate Mackie (Avengers: Endgame) and Abdul-Mateen II (Aquaman) were excellent together here, making their character\u2019s friendship come to life with subtle homoeroticism that was confusing to them both, and Beharie (TV\u2019s Sleepy Hollow) lent strong support in a role that could\u2019ve blurred into the background in lesser hands.Directed by Owen Harris (who\u2019s completed an unofficial Black Mirror trilogy about love and tech, following \u201cBe Right Back\u201d and \u201cSan Junipero\u201d), filmed in beautiful S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, \u201cStriking Vipers\u201d looked great and clever things to say in an enjoyable package. It just had a tendency to meander and wasn\u2019t as engrossing or compulsive, which we know the best Black Mirror can be in spades.Originally published at https://www.framerated.co.uk on June 6, 2019.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Black Mirror", "Netflix", "Culture", "Review", "Television"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@mshelton/i-havent-looked-into-vyprvpn-i-have-looked-into-telegram-3efe83dd0cc3?source=search_post", "author_name": "Martin Shelton", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@mshelton", "publish_date": "2016-11-17", "last_modified_date": "2017-04-23", "readtime": "0.42", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "No love for VyprVPN and Telegram Messenger?1didlixMartin SheltonFollowNov 17, 2016 \u00b7 1 min readI haven\u2019t looked into VyprVPN!

However, the Red Wings weren\u2019t the only Detroit/Michigan hockey team I had a special place in my heart for. I was kind of a die-hard Detroit Vipers fan for a long time.The Vipers had a couple of really cool things going for them. First, the name and the jersey. I mean, come on. Too cool.They played at the Palace of Auburn Hills which was only about 15 minutes from my house and was actually a really nice arena during the time they played there.During pre-game introductions they came out of a huge inflatable snake mouth filled with smoke. By far the coolest entrance of any hockey team.Tickets were cheap. Even now I think I can count on one hand the number of Detroit Red Wing games I have seen in person. I must\u2019ve seen the Vipers 10\u201315 times over the course of a few years.One of my teammate\u2019s dad was the head coach of the Vipers. To me, the Vipers were just as impressive as the Red Wings. They were professional hockey players who played in front of thousands of fans every single game. The fact that I got to hang out with someone I considered a legitimate celebrity was pretty cool.My favorite memory of the Vipers, though, didn\u2019t even involve going to an actual game. Instead, I distinctly remember listening to them play in the Turner Cup finals on a little radio while I laid in bed. They must\u2019ve been playing a team out west because I remember it being pretty late. I think the game went into overtime, too. I can\u2019t remember if it was game seven or just the fourth win. All I know is that the Vipers won the game and were therefore Turner Cup champions!It felt anti-climactic to lay in bed while my 2nd favorite hockey team had just won a championship so I got out of bed and walked through the dark and quiet house (my parents and all my brothers were asleep) and whisper cheered.Man, I miss the Vipers.Game NotesI doubt there is anybody my age or a little bit earlier who can watch the Red Wings play the Devils and not have painful flashbacks to the mid-90\u2019s and the absolutely devastating experiences we had playing that team. Not only did we get swept in the 1995 finals after dominating the regular season, but we got swept by a team playing the most boring hockey in the world. It seems unlikely that a play style that existed 22 years ago is still alive in this year\u2019s incarnation of the team, but I swear the Devils are always the most boring team. Always.What really stood out to me in this game was how much trouble the Wings have with breaking out of their own zone. Any team with a halfway competent forecheck gives us absolute fits on the breakout. There were a couple points in the game where we spent the entire shift in our own zone just wrapping the puck along the boards, behind the net, and then getting into a scrum at the hashmarks before whipping it around the boards again. I swear to god there was one shift where that happened 4 times in a row.This game was boring forever and then it wasn\u2019t! Mantha scored! Which is lucky for him because he still looked lethargic and lame as hell out there. It\u2019s interesting to see the power that a goal can have on the momentum of the game, though. Mantha\u2019s goal *was* pretty lucky but it didn\u2019t matter. We came out afterward and actually had some jump in our step.Booth had himself a season tonight. Good for him.Jensen must have had the fastest emotional rollercoaster of all time on the OT goal. He went from thinking he was springing the forwards on a 2-on-1 the other way to putting it directly on the tape of the opposing team in less than a second. That can\u2019t feel good.The Wings scrounge up another point by losing in OT, falling to 10\u20139\u20135 on the season.

Learn more about VIPER here.When Kyle Kersey wants to describe his research, he finds it difficult to delve into the intricacies of coordination, solubility and steric effects. So he\u2019s settled on a different tactic.\u201cThe word I like to use is \u2018humbling,\u2019\u201d Kersey says. In the lab, he works to synthesize new radioactive compounds, and the reactions don\u2019t always proceed as planned. In fact, they rarely ever do.\u201cIt\u2019s never going to work the first time. You should be concerned if it does,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause then you have to figure out how to do it again. I feel like I\u2019ve done it the same way 10,000 times and it never gives me the same result twice.\u201dKersey is a rising junior in VIPER studying chemical and biomolecular engineering in Penn Engineering and chemistry in Penn\u2019s School of Arts & Sciences. He conducts research with uranium and thorium in the lab of Eric Schelter, an associate professor in the Department of Chemistry in Arts & Sciences.Even though uranium was discovered centuries ago, scientists still don\u2019t understand much about its highest oxidation state, uranium(VI), in which each atom is missing six electrons. Kersey is trying to create a compound with a double bond between uranium(VI) and carbon, which hasn\u2019t been done before. It\u2019s a challenging synthetic problem.\u201cUranium tends to prefer really \u2018hard\u2019 donors like nitrogen and oxygen,\u201d Kersey says, referring to elements that easily lend their negatively-charged electrons to the positively-charged uranium.Carbon, in comparison, is a \u201csoft\u201d donor. It\u2019s not as generous with its electrons, so it\u2019s difficult for carbon to form a stable bond with uranium. For Kersey, that means trying many different ways of coercing the molecules into forming the product he wants.\u201cSo much of it is trial and error,\u201d Kersey says.Eventually, his work could help improve the storage of spent nuclear fuel. In nuclear reactors, uranium(VI) bonds with two oxygen atoms to form uranyl, a byproduct of energy generation.\u201cThe problem is that uranyl is very water soluble,\u201d Kersey says. \u201cWhen we store nuclear waste in cladding and bury it deep underground, the cladding can crack under various weather conditions.\u201dAs uranyl is both toxic and radioactive, this poses an issue for its long-term storage.\u201cIt leaches into the groundwater and you have radioactive contamination,\u201d Kersey says.Learning more about the chemistry of uranium(VI) could help scientists tailor the reaction to form a byproduct that\u2019s not as water soluble and therefore poses less of a threat to the environment.But for Kersey, the real draw is finding the right combination of reagents, solvents and techniques to create his desired product.\u201cThis specific compound is novel,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a new, challenging synthetic build. That\u2019s really interesting.\u201dKersey is no stranger to the lab bench. He\u2019s also working on two other synthesis projects in Schelter\u2019s lab, both involving thorium. And thanks to Michio Kaku, a well-known futurist and theoretical physicist, he worked on three different projects in two separate labs before even coming to Penn.The two met at an interview and dinner event honoring Kaku in Louisville, Kentucky, where Kersey grew up. He was a freshman in high school at the time.They were talking for a little bit, Kersey says, when Kaku asked him if his high school offered any mentoring partnerships with the University of Louisville for students interested in research. Kersey didn\u2019t think so, but he was intrigued by the possibility of working in a lab before college. Luckily, the dean of Louisville\u2019s Speed School of Engineering also happened to be at the event, and Kersey approached him with the idea.\u201cSo that\u2019s how I got started in the physics department doing optics work,\u201d Kersey says. \u201cI stayed there for about two years until my interests started to shift more toward chemistry and chemical engineering.\u201dIn the Schelter lab, Kersey works with depleted uranium. It\u2019s not as potent as natural or enriched uranium, but still requires some precautions. His workstation, known as a glove box, is an enclosed cabinet with a thick window. Two large black rubber gloves integrated into the window allow him to carry out his experiments. Since thickly gloved hands don\u2019t allow for much precision, he first had to learn to use a pair of long tweezers to grasp small glass vials and thin pipettes.It took him several weeks to figure out a technique that worked, which was made more difficult by the fact that glove boxes are designed for right-handed people (he\u2019s left-handed). Now, he can move materials deftly around the box and carry out his experiments with ease.Following his graduation from Penn, Kersey hopes to pursue a Ph.D. in nuclear science and engineering.\u201cI\u2019ve always been really fascinated with nuclear energy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is amazing to be able to take this mineral from the earth and create so much energy out of it.\u201dKersey credits the VIPER intensive summer research experience with accelerating both his lab skills and chemical understanding.He describes developing a \u201cphysical intuition,\u201d and explains that he can now figure out which chemicals to use even if he doesn\u2019t know the more complex details of their interactions.\u201cWhen you get the trial by fire over the summer, it helps,\u201d Kersey says. \u201cYou form a sense of comfort that you wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect to have in my case, as a rising junior with two semesters of organic chemistry and that\u2019s it.\u201dAfter two summers, a spring semester and countless hours in the lab, he looks forward to his fourth and final VIPER research experience next year. He ultimately hopes to publish his work, but that\u2019s not what keeps him coming back to the lab every day. Instead, he\u2019s driven by the synthetic challenge and the opportunity to advance scientific knowledge.\u201cYou will have an impact regardless of the end result,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have done the work and you\u2019ve contributed something to field. That\u2019s a good feeling.\u201d", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Science", "Engineering", "Chemistry", "Nuclear", "STEM"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@WebReflection/great-post-too-bad-you-didnt-try-hyperhtml-and-its-isomorphic-viperhtml-counterpart-63a27d89ac42?source=search_post", "author_name": "Andrea Giammarchi", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@WebReflection", "publish_date": "2017-04-07", "last_modified_date": "2018-02-03", "readtime": "0.20", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Javascript Frameworks: A futile attempt at objectivity18929Matt BurgessAndrea GiammarchiFollowApr 7, 2017 \u00b7 1 min readGreat post, too bad you didn\u2019t try hyperHTML and its isomorphic viperHTML counterpart.Easy as a template literal, 100% based on DOM and ES standards, light and fast, if not faster, than anything else mentioned in here.Post: https://medium.com/@WebReflection/hyperhtml-a-virtual-dom-alternative-279db455ee0eHacker News PWA: https://viper-news.now.sh/top/1and its source: https://github.com/WebReflection/viper-news#viper-news", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Jak jsem se pokou\u0161ela o vypracov\u00e1n\u00ed projektu", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@barbora.sulc.bohackova/jak-jsem-se-pokou%C5%A1ela-o-vypracov%C3%A1n%C3%AD-projektu-32cf64922793?source=search_post", "author_name": "Barbora \u0160ulc Boh\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@barbora.sulc.bohackova", "publish_date": "2017-11-19", "last_modified_date": "2017-11-22", "readtime": "6.33", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Jak jsem se pokou\u0161ela o vypracov\u00e1n\u00ed projektuBarbora \u0160ulc Boh\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1FollowNov 19, 2017 \u00b7 7 min read\u2026aneb nikdy mne tolik nebavilo n\u011bco, co mi ne\u0161lo\u2026zat\u00edm\u2026Ahoj,tenhle p\u0159\u00edsp\u011bvek slou\u017e\u00ed jako v\u00fdstup m\u00e9ho sna\u017een\u00ed Digit\u00e1ln\u00ed akademie.SPOILER alert: Projekt se (zat\u00edm) nepoda\u0159ilo dokon\u010dit.Pokud jste sem zav\u00edtali omylem a nev\u00edte, co to je Digit\u00e1ln\u00ed akademie, tak se to m\u016f\u017eete do\u010d\u00edst na str\u00e1nk\u00e1ch neziskov\u00e9 organizace Czechitas. :) A ur\u010dit\u011b se p\u0159ihlaste na jeden z jejich kurz\u016f!Od za\u010d\u00e1tkuCel\u00fd tenhle koloto\u010d za\u010dal ve chv\u00edli, kdy jsem se dozv\u011bd\u011bla, \u017ee jsem byla p\u0159ijat\u00e1 do DA.

And if you\u2019re not, and you\u2019re in search of the best binoculars for bird watching or the best binoculars for hunting, or just the best 10\u00d742 binoculars overall, at a good price, then you should really consider getting the Viper HD.An upgrade to the 8\u00d742 version, the Viper HD 10\u00d742 contains some qualities that qualify it as one of the best binoculars around. To cement this claim, I\u2019ve decided to do an extensive review of this particular model\u2019s main features. This review is based entirely on my personal testing of the model. Let\u2019s begin!Vortex Viper HD 10\u00d742 Binoculars ReviewThe Vortex series is made in Japan and come with high-end optics. However, as opposed to \u2018alpha\u2019 model binoculars which are often very good but at an excessive cost, the Viper HD series aim for performance and user utility at a good value for money. This upholds Vortex binoculars as one of the best performing binoculars for how much they cost. In fact, Vortex binoculars are one of the most popular types on the market.Main Specifications and FeaturesDesign: Single bridge bodyDimensions: 5.75in (14.6cm) x 5.24in (13.3cm)Weight: 24.6ozs (697g)This binocular boosts of some impressive eye-catching optical stats:Field of View: 319ft at 1000yds; great for huntingClose focus: min. focal distance is about 5.1ft. You can zoom in on flowers, insects, and even birds; which is great!Eye Relief: 16.5mm; good fie eye-glass wearersSingle Bridge Body DesignThe Vortex Viper HD has a single bridge body design, which is custom for modern full-sized roof prism binoculars. Hence it feels very comfortable and well balanced. I noticed on the underside of the binocular that there are two small thumb indents to enable users to hold it in the correct way. This slick design eases bird watching as you can move your binoculars about easily without it slippingSlick Focus WheelYou\u2019ll discover that the focus wheel of the Vortex Viper HD 10\u00d742 is centrally located, also nicely set and looks great! Its large focus wheel has very good grip supported by its tactile stippled exterior. Although the focus wheel may differ from the somewhat conventionally smooth wheel, you\u2019ll see its benefit best in winter conditions when you\u2019re forced to wear thick gloves. You\u2019ll need loads of grip in such conditions. If you hunt in the winter, this feature in your binoculars is very paramount.Lockable Diopter RingLike all Vortex Viper binoculars, this binocular have a dioptre that is lockable. Its dioptre located on the right eye-piece, the model helps you lock in your preset optics. This is a pretty cool feature as your dioptre settings can\u2019t accidentally shift or readjust.I must admit, this is an often overlooked feature, but when you think about it, a lockable diopter ring is a fantastic indicator of quality. You\u2019ll understand the importance of a locked on diopter ring when you go bird watching.100% WaterproofAs aforementioned, the Vortex Viper HD binocular is fully O-ring sealed and is therefore waterproof. For its price, such features are to be expected. However, what sets the Vortex binocular apart is the fact that it uses Argon gas and not the conventional Nitrogen gas. Argon gas is more resistant to diffusion. The best time to watch birds is preferably at dawn. There is always often a fog at early hours and this one is fog proof.Adaptable TripodAt some point, if you need to attach your binoculars to a tripod, know that the Vortex Viper HD has a screw thread that fits into many adaptable tripods. What can\u2019t this model do, really?Construction Materials and DurabilityThis binocular has great roof prisms stand out because they are corrected and dielectrically coated as well. Most high-level binoculars have less reflective silver mirror coatings but the Vortex\u2019s allows 99% of light to enter the prism for a brighter viewThe Vortex Optics has tough exterior coatings on the exterior glass surfaces that protect the lenses from scratching. Little chance of leaving marks when cleaning the lenses.The Viper HD comes with the usual accessories: a carry case, lens covers cleaning cloth and a quality neck strap.And the warranty: It\u2019s for a lifetime! Beat that!Let\u2019s check it out, just only $499.00 on AmazonFor a mid-high value binocular, the Vortex Viper HD 10\u00d742 exceeds expectation. But like everything in life, this binocular suffers some short co-sufferHeavyAlthough it is very functional, it\u2019s not the most comfortable binocular around. To be honest, for its price, there are many better comfortable binoculars on the market. How heavy is it? Well, you may find yourself carrying your binocular in your backpack a lot. The case straps are fine; however, they could be longer.Visibility IssuesDon\u2019t get this totally wrong. This Vortex has great optics. You could zoom in at hillsides from 1000 yards away and it would still look fantastic. But on hot days, the heat waves affect visibility negatively. The best time to enjoy your Vortex Viper binocular would be to use them early in the morning or evening hours (even with little light).Quality Control IssuesWell, I don\u2019t do PR or regulate quality control for the Viper HD series manufacturer, but there are sometimes cases of defective products. So if yours doesn\u2019t meet expectation, give Vortex a call and they\u2019ll get it changed..The Vortex Viper HD 10\u00d742 binocular is a very wonderful high-end optical gadget which merits a higher price really if you consider the quality features, extra components and precise attention to detail. With such fine features as these, you can use the Vortex binoculars for bird watching, outdoor sports, safari & travel, general wildlife observation, hunting, marine use & astronomy. It may just about be one of the best binoculars for hunting if it isn\u2019t already one of the best binoculars for bird watching.Originally published at https://bestbuybinoculars.com on April 15, 2019.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Photography", "Binoculars", "Vortex", "Optics"]}, {"title": "La Performance De Vyprvpn", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@lesmeilleursvpn/la-performance-de-vyprvpn-4ee43f90b72c?source=search_post", "author_name": "LesMeilleursVPN", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@lesmeilleursvpn", "publish_date": "2017-01-25", "last_modified_date": "2017-01-25", "readtime": "1.42", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "La Performance De VyprvpnLesMeilleursVPNFollowJan 25, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readSi vous avez l\u2019intention de vous procurer le service de VyprVPN il est tr\u00e8s important d\u2019\u00eatre au courant de sa performance et c\u2019est pour cela que nous avons r\u00e9dig\u00e9 cet avis VyprVPN.

Le tableau de bord vous donne des statistiques sur le serveur, le temps que vous \u00eates connect\u00e9 au VPN et le type de protocole et de chiffrement que vous utilisez.Ce proxy Web compte 700 serveurs r\u00e9partis sur 52 sites diff\u00e9rents et il dispose \u00e9galement de 200 000 adresses IP. Avoir un grand nombre d\u2019adresses IP est important car cela signifie que ces adresses IP sont moins susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre signal\u00e9s comme suspects par les principaux moteurs de recherche, comme Google, ou des plateformes de m\u00e9dias sociaux, comme Facebook. Bien qu\u2019aucune entreprise ne peut garantir qu\u2019une adresse IP ne sera pas bloqu\u00e9e, le fait d\u2019avoir un nombre d\u2019adresses plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour effectuer le cycle r\u00e9duit le risque d\u2019\u00eatre bloqu\u00e9.Avec ce logiciel proxy, vous pouvez ex\u00e9cuter deux p\u00e9riph\u00e9riques simultan\u00e9ment sur un seul compte.

With their top rated VPN service, they provide Internet privacy, encryption, security services and so much more.Check the Latest DealsVyprVPN Secure Personal VPNGolden Frog was founded back in 1994, but only recently in 2010 VyprVPN introduced the company\u2019s premium VPN service for consumers. Just like other comparable VPN services, VyprVPN offers many features for all user needs.VyprVPN can be used to bypass website restrictions or filtering implemented by governments or work place filters. Using a VPN can allow users to surf the web securely and privately. All these Internet security features are available with the VyprVPN service for very low prices. Let\u2019s take a deeper look at what VyprVPN has to offer in our VyprVPN review.Installation & ConfigurationDuring our review of VyprVPN, we found the installation and configuration process is relatively smooth. Traditionally, VyprVPN is provided as a manually configurable service. Once you complete your account setup and payment, VyprVPN support sends you the setup parameters which include username, password and IP proxies as well as LAN settings.This information is used to set up VPN access through your device LAN settings. If you encounter any issues during setup there are numerous tutorials provided by Golden Frog to help you get the VPN connected successfully.VyprVPN\u2019s are always looking to make the service better, so they also provide an one-click application that streamlines the entire setup process of VPN re-routing. All you have to do is install the VyprVPN application, and the features is accessible via your notifications area in the task bar.You can change most of the settings and reroute your access through different countries, IPs, servers, security protocols and a many more features through the VyprVPN app. The application is clean and uncluttered, with only the features required accessible.The VyprVPN app is available for Windows and Mac OS X, iOS and Android devices and Linux. iPad\u2019s are supported via the iOS app.There are setup tutorials to help with installation and configuring the software, or you can contact Golden Frog customer care. VyprVPN supports a range of security protocols, varying from 1280-bit PPTP, 156-bit L2TP and 160 & 256 OpenVPN.VyprVPN has also introduced their own proprietary security protocol named Chameleon. This protocol is perfect for use in countries or network that have aggressive traffic filtering restrictions which use Deep Packet Inspection (DPI).VyprVPN seem to be always introducing new features for their users. Among the latest additions is a SmartDNS feature called VyprDNS. SmartDNS has the same functionality as VPN in terms of circumventing geo-restricted content but is faster since it, unlike VPN, does not encrypt the data. VyprDNS is not sold as a standalone product, but offered as a feature for all VyprVPN users.Subscription CostThree subscription packages exist from VyprVPN, which depending on the users\u2019 VPN needs. These three packages are Basic, Pro or Premier VPN accesses.The cost of the Basic VyprVPN package is $9.99 per month. This comes with support for PPTP security protocol with 128-bit encryption. It also includes 10 GB of Dump Truck storage. The VPN package is also available on a yearly subscription basis which will further cut down the subscription fee to $6.67.The VyprVPN Pro package will cost you $14.99 per month for full access to all security protocols and supports two simultaneous connections along with 25 GB of free Dump Truck storage. To avail of the discounted rate, you can subscribe to a full-year term that would only cost $99.96.The Premier package, on the other hand, costs $19.99 per month and offers all of the features available in the Pro package, but you can enjoy more simultaneous connections (three devices in total) and a free 50 GB of Dump Truck storage.NAT Firewall option is now available free of cost for both Pro and Premier VyprVPN subscribers. NAT firewall is mainly targeted at wireless Internet users to prevent third party hackers from accessing sensitive information.VyprVPN has removed their old seven-day money back guarantee and are now offering a three-day free trial. This implies that you don\u2019t have to pay for the free trial, and if you wish to pay for the VPN service, you will be billed from the fourth day onward. Otherwise you can terminate the service within the three days and not have to pay any money.The payment option can hinder most secure web browsers. VyprVPN accepts credit card and PayPal payments, which should be sufficient for most buyers. Some users who are reluctant in provide personal information or credit card details to VPN networks may be missing a payment option that is completely anonymous, like Bitcoin.Check the Latest DealsSpeed, Reliability & BandwidthVyprVPN performs very well across all independent speed tests. Realistically, users can expect speeds ranging from 40\u201360 percent of the available browsing speed. At best, we were able to reach around 69 percent of the maximum available browsing speed, making VyprVPN an above average VPN service provider in the industry.You can stream videos and enjoy a few medium-sized downloads simultaneously. But if you are really working on an extremely fast network, you will find that VyprVPN has its speed capped to cater to the average customer demands. VyprVPN state that they offer unlimited speeds.We found VyprVPN very reliable during testing, with network drop outs only occurring occasionally. There were also a couple of times that I noticed a drop off in speed. This lead to longer website loading times, as well as timeout errors. In each case I rectified the issue by switching to a different server location.As you can see from the following VPN speed test on YouTube, VyprVPN really does perform well when it comes to upload and download speeds.VyprVPN allows unlimited usage and bandwidth, which is a significant selling point compared to other VPN services.Server LocationsVyprVPN has different servers spread around the globe. As of this writing, there are about 700+ servers operating in 40+ countries. Confidently, users can be assured of a secured VPN experience since GoldenFrog manages its own global network of servers, which by the way is now incorporated in Switzerland.One of the benefits of using VyprVPN is that it allows unlimited switches between servers. This is actually an advantage on VyprVPN\u2019s part, but there are no dedicated IPs. Dynamic IPs are offered to all their customers.Traditionally, VPN companies chose to install several different server farms in a specific country or server location. For instance, if a company has chosen the UK as a server location, there will be multiple servers and IPs that will be identifiable to the user as uk1, uk2, uk3, etc. as the prefix to the server address or URL. VyprVPN, on the other hand, chose to install a single server farm with multiple clusters.This ensures that the user will only have access to a single server address starting, like \u2018uk1\u2019, but behind that, you\u2019ll find multiple clusters that will reroute traffic according to the load or speed/bandwidth deficit. VyprVPN claims that this automatic server re-routing and switching will reduce downtime, which will in turn have positive effects on the user-experience. With this setup, VyprVPN offer more than 200,000 different IP addresses from its 43 server locations.At the time of writing this review these are just some of the international locations provided by VyprVPNEuropeAustria \u2014 ViennaBelgium \u2014 BrusselsCzech Republic \u2014 PragueDenmark \u2014 CopenhagenEurope \u2014 LuxembourgFinland \u2014 HelsinkiFrance \u2014 ParisGermany \u2014 FrankfurtIceland \u2014 Reykjav\u00edkIreland \u2014 DublinItaly \u2014 RomeLithuania \u2014 VilniusNetherlands \u2014 AmsterdamNorway \u2014 OsloPoland \u2014 WarsawPortugal \u2014 LisbonRomania \u2014 BucharestRussia \u2014 MoscowSpain \u2014 MadridSweden \u2014 StockholmSwitzerland \u2014 ZurichTurkey \u2014 IstanbulU.K. \u2014 LondonNorth AmericaCanada \u2014 TorontoMexico \u2014 Mexico CityU.S. \u2014 AustinU.S. \u2014 Los AngelesU.S. \u2014 MiamiU.S. \u2014 Washington, D.C.OceaniaAustralia \u2014 MelbourneAustralia \u2014 PerthAustralia \u2014 SydneyNew Zealand \u2014 AucklandSouth AmericaBrazil \u2014 S\u00e3o PauloAsiaAsia \u2014 Hong KongIndonesia \u2014 JakartaJapan \u2014 TokyoMalaysia \u2014 Kuala LampurPhilippines \u2014 ManilaSingapore \u2014 SingaporeSouth Korea \u2014 SeoulThailand \u2014 BangkokVietnam \u2014 HanoiCustomer SupportVyprVPN promises quality customer service, and all the correspondence is through email, live chat or ticket system. The live chat is available 24\u00d77 and you can avail of round the clock assistance from the helpful staff. Other VPN providers claim they have live chat support when in fact it\u2019s barely even online.Support ticket systems are notorious for their reputation of being backlogged. It might take a while to get through to support using the email or ticket system. The fastest option for reaching customer service should be the live chat feature. Once you reach a representative, you will find them to be helpful and attentive.Issues & ProblemsVyprVPN is not without fault. Website timeout and \u2018can\u2019t connect\u2019 error messages are not entirely absent, which can either be due to the computer, firewall or even server errors. In any case, server switching is the best line of action.The cost of subscription is slightly higher than some other providers. VyprVPN\u2019s overall service offering, however, is definitely above average, so if you can afford it, you get real quality with this premium provider.In terms of the Heartbleed and Shellshock bug vulnerabilities, the company affirm that their VPN service or any Golden Frog services for that matter are safe, for now. However, due to the nature of these bugs, the company still recommend that users change their password.Now if you have been experiencing some speed slowdowns when watching videos on Netflix, know that the problem is not from VyprVPN\u2019s network but rather, from Netflix itself. As a matter of fact, Golden Frog just released a second infographic in relation to why Netflix speeds have decreased over the past years. Do check out the infographic, \u201cThe Peering Problem\u201c.VyprVPN Review ConclusionIn conclusion to this VyprVPN review we\u2019ve found VyprVPN to be a top quality, no-nonsense VPN provider. They offer a high-performing service and don\u2019t promise anything they can\u2019t deliver. The cost of subscription may prevent some people from signing up to VyprVPN, but with the recent reduction in subscription cost (up to 33 percent) and the introduction of proprietary apps, we expect a huge growth in new customers.That being said, VyprVPN is excellent for those who expect safe and reliable web browsing with greater protection from security issues. If your budget allows for it, VyprVPN will give you the highest performance available on the market today. With the introduction of dedicated VyprVPN applications for Mac OS X and Windows, getting started is easy. The application can easily launch upon log in and run smoothly in the background.Discount & Coupon CodesAs with most other VPN service providers, VyprVPN offers a three-day free trial and no questions will be asked.Check the Latest DealsThe post VyprVPN Review \u2014 One of the Most Popular VPNs on the Market appeared first on VPN Comparisons 2016\u20132017.fromhttp://vpnreviews.online/vyprvpn-review/", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Magovi a Tokidovi vypr\u0161ela smlouva s MadCatz", "post_link": "https://czecharcade.com/magovi-a-tokidovi-vypr%C5%A1ela-smlouva-s-madcatz-9ef495dbefca?source=search_post", "author_name": "Czech Arcade", "author_link": "https://czecharcade.com/@CzechArcade", "publish_date": "2016-04-13", "last_modified_date": "2016-07-26", "readtime": "0.58", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Magovi a Tokidovi vypr\u0161ela smlouva s MadCatzCzech ArcadeFollowApr 13, 2016 \u00b7 1 min readKenryo \u201cMago\u201d Hayashi a Hajime \u201cTokido\u201d Taniguchi, oba p\u0159edn\u00ed hr\u00e1\u010di Street Fighteru, hr\u00e1li posledn\u00ed rok v t\u00fdmu MadCatz, je\u0161t\u011b spolu s Daigem \u201cThe Beast\u201d Umeharou.

Prepare for the long read.The ToolboxQuite expectedly, you may want to know why I thought it reasonable to create yet another VIPER. But the answer certainly won\u2019t surprise you \u2014 simply because I wasn\u2019t satisfied with what any other VIPER gave me, much like everyone else who made their own VIPER. Particularly, I would highlight the following:Lack of clarity. Most descriptions of VIPER for Swift are very vague in details and lack many required patters to solve very common problems.Poor testability. Most VIPERs that are suggested for Swift don\u2019t put much effort on testing and either just test Presenters, or nothing at all going with just a mention that oh yeah, you can do testing, of course. Then again, why\u2019d you chose VIPER if you didn\u2019t want to test everything?No definitive modularity. Hey there, a random author of another VIPER. So do you expect me to put every single View, Presenter, Router, Interactor and many many other things into a global scope? Yes, I know there is no namespacing in Swift. But there are modules! And they are not so hard to use.Dangling ends. Ok, this one is the most important. How did viewDidLoad got into Presenter?! What the hell is this? That, most certainly, isn\u2019t how Presenter is supposed to roll. How do you make a callback from an API? Pass a closure to Presenter from View? What?! This is just getting weird. Have you even tried making an architecture, and not just splitting code between several sorta-unrelated classes?Bad suitability with basic iOS patterns. So storyboards or not? Not a single VIPER supports segues for certain. Storyboards are not very common, and instantiated by hand. Sometimes when you look at those VIPERs you just feel like you are doing some yoga with iOS \u2014 it\u2019s all good and healthy, but are you sure you should scratch your ear with your foot? How is it even here and your arm is where again? And now you somehow walk???? Don\u2019t let me even start on all the oh-right-this-is-certainly-VIPER architectures with tens of protocols per Presenter, with complete inability to change a single feature on a screen in a couple of basic edits, with method swizzling as a necessity, and let\u2019s not forget I-pulled-code-from-viewcontroller-and-put-it-into-presenter-now-it\u2019s-VIPER super-clean architectures.You may not agree with this stuff, but then again, I don\u2019t urge you to use my VIPER either. If you do agree though, then let\u2019s get on with this, and I\u2019ll present to you a full and definitive VIPER Toolbox.How this article is structuredFirst I\u2019m going to introduce you to the basic concepts and the requirements of VIPER in general. Even if you know VIPER, you may want still to read this, since I\u2019m trying to convey what I think is important in it and this may help a lot going forward.Then you\u2019ll see the layout of the VIPER Toolbox, along with some concepts and requirements. Each component has its requirements that are needed to keep it sane and VIPERy, suggested usages and references to common patterns you may want to have there, the list of all imports it is allowed to have, and what other components may know about its existence and use it.Some terminology I\u2019ll make use of:Framework. Also known as Swift module. Implemented as a separate Framework target in Xcode.VIPER Module. A combination of View, Presenter, and Interactor. Explained later in the article.Unit test. An isolated test of a feature/component. In Xcode is a single class of a Unit Testing Bundle Target.UI test. A user-oriented test of the app that simulates user actions on the app and verifies the behavior of the app. In Xcode is a single class of a UI Testing Bundle Target.View Unit test. An isolated test of the design and behavior of a single screen. Explained later in the article.Integration test. A Unit test or a UI test that uses a combination of several components and tests them in tandem.You\u2019ll also see a lot of Objectivity checks. They are here to help you verify that your component is done right, though of course they don\u2019t guarantee this. They look like this:Objectivity Check:\u2705 You are reading this article on Medium.com or in the Medium app.\u2705 The author is Ilya Mikhaltsou.\u274c You had to pay for access to this articleWhat is VIPER, againVIPER is, by itself, a modern architecture that was created to combat the problem of Massive View Controller in MVC architecture. It was initially designed for iOS, in Objective-C. Notably, iOS is where the problem of Massive View Controller strikes the most, though I wouldn\u2019t go here into details of why this happens. In short, the major reason is lack of good separation of concerns between the View and the Controller, and the name ViewController that all controllers have on iOS just spells out this obvious fact.So VIPER stands for View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Router. Other than being a good-sounding name, there isn\u2019t a reason for it to have been named that. Specifically confusing here is Entity, which seems to be just for the sake of having an \u2018e\u2019 letter in the acronym. In fact, the core components of the VIPER are View, Presenter, Interactor, Service, and Router, and in this order. Some designs also specify Builder, Helper, Entity, and whatever else they see fit, and still keep the name VIPER.The grand big idea of VIPER is to have all non-view logic being taken care of by Presenter. But then again, each single concern should also be wrapped in a Service, and may be shared between Presenters. And then each Presenter shouldn\u2019t be concerned with what Services they need, so there\u2019s an Interactor. And while you already got lots of boilerplate only to do this, you also got yourself a pretty clean design.A combination of one View, one Presenter, and one Interactor is called a Module. This is basically your screen. You can swap out Interactor to a mock and test a Presenter, and you don\u2019t need a View for that. You can swap a presenter for a mock and test a View, and you need neither Services nor Interactor. You can also unit-test each Service, and you need nothing else for this. All thanks to a clean architecture.The last bit of VIPER is the Router, also called a wireframe. This is a monolithic bit that knows how components and modules of your app tie together. While no VIPER Module should have even a hint of existence of other modules, the Router is what knows each. One single Router is tied to the Module it controls, and knows which other modules it can pass control to, may know what services its own Module and other modules need, and knows how to transition between the screens of your app.So if you followed along, you should already know what to look for in VIPER. And if you happen to know other VIPERs, you may also already see how this \u2018basic concept of VIPER\u2019 isn\u2019t preserved much in those.Onwards to a VIPER Toolbox then.VIPER Toolbox componentsLet\u2019s introduce the basic layout of the VIPER Toolbox design and the components that go into it, starting from the simplest and on to the most complex ones.Keep in mind, that most of those components define their interfaces in a protocol, while having a \u201cdefault\u201d implementation alongside those protocols. This is required for good testability and for clarity.ServiceThis is your goto component for any logic, from system frameworks, to APIs, to data storage, to configuration, and whatever else you may want.While most other VIPERs say that your app may be structured any way you want and that Service is just everything that is external to your presentation layer, I would suggest starting with the services. One feature equals one Service. Of course, it should be its own framework. While it may contain inside whatever you want it to, it should only expose the Service itself and maybe some Models it makes use of.Requirements. Expose (make public) protocol WhateverService. Expose default implementation DefaultWhateverService and its init method. Expose whatever is needed to construct an instance of DefaultWhateverService. Expose whatever models this service needs to accept or provide.Patterns. You may want to have your Services to have one common pattern of callbacks and asynchrony. I personally prefer PromiseKit. You may want to have anything else, from closures to Rx. But you should stick to it. And please, stay away from delegates (this concerns the rest of the architecture as well)\u2026It is best to have your constructor take all dependencies as arguments and store them as properties for later use.You may also prefer to have it stateful. An example would be if it is a Service for your login \u2014 it should know from the start if it\u2019s already logged in or not and can change its state from logged in to not logged in.Prefer heavy use of exceptions. Don\u2019t handle exceptions in your services, but if you need, transform them.Having a protocol that defines the interface of a given service is a good practice if you want to share mocks through the app, but not a requirement.Imports. Your service may import any other service and anything else that is not VIPER (that is, not View, Presenter, Interactor, Router). Prefer not to import UIKit, unless your external dependency requires it.Usage. Should be imported in Routers and in Interactors (and obviously in its own Unit test). Can be imported for its protocol in VIPER Screen Module Unit test.Objectivity Check:\u2705 Your Unit test for the Service can work on any platform without the rest of the app and with no \u201csupporting\u201d code.VIPER Screen ModuleThis is your actual screen, but without any design. This one consists of Interactor, Presenter, View interface, and Router interface. Make it a framework. Don\u2019t put anything else there.Usage. Should be imported in Routers and in your actual UIViewController subclass. Nowhere else.InteractorThat is the most simple component of the entire architecture, but it\u2019s also very easy and very tempting to do it wrong.Basically, your good Interactor is just a number of one-liner methods that call out to various methods from services. Nothing less, nothing more.The Interactor is there to help you do a couple of things:Helps you have an overview of what your screen usesUnties Presenter from dependency on your servicesHelps to ease unit-testing of the Presenter by being simply swappableIt goes into the screen module framework, along with Presenter.Requirements. Expose (make public) protocol Interactor. Expose default implementation DefaultInteractor and its init method. Keep methods to one-liners with zero logic.Patterns. Keep the callback patterns that were used by your services, whatever they are. Your methods are pretty much just lifted methods from your services.Keep the exception signatures the same as in methods of your services.It is best to have your constructor take all the dependent services as arguments and store them as properties for later use.Interactor is strictly stateless. Its only stored properties should be services themselves.Imports. Interactor only imports services.Usage. Should be used only by the Presenter in the same module. Instantiated by Router.Objectivity Check:\u2705 Interactor is so simple that there is simply nothing to run unit tests against.\u2705 Writing an empty mock Interactor is as simple as writing methods and properties that are empty or just return default values, or throw an exception (if any), or instantly call a callback with empty or default values, or an error.\u2705 If you replace your actual Interactor with such mock \u2014 the app works as expected.\u274c Interactor has conditional logic.\u274c Interactor operates on navigation (wireframe) of your app.\u274c Interactor contains and/or defines some Model.\u274c Interactor has methods that imply user actions (i.e. mainButtonTapped) or system events (i.e. viewDidLoad).PresenterHere goes the most important component of our application. This is the actual logic of the screen. You want it to be completely untied from the way the View operates, but you also want it to provide the interface that is decisively simple and native to the View. For example, if you have some numerical value for price in your model\u2013service\u2013interactor, but your view is actually displaying it as a textual string, Presenter is supposed to output that exact string, sans formatting. But then if your View requires different formatting for dollar amount and cents, you will want your Presenter to give you two separate string. In a way, you can say that it is untied in code logic, but it is tightly tied semantically.Put in your Presenter everything that makes your app internal processes visual. Transform your models, split them, collect information about them, count them, start some actions, get callbacks and adapt your view to the results, process and display errors/exceptions. Everything goes.But keep in mind that your Presenter has just two external dependencies. Those are View and Router. It can\u2019t have any other dependency, including UIKit.The Presenter logically unties all the internal workings of your app from the View. Whatever must have been happening internally, your Presenter just processes some user action and sometime later changes the state of the View.To a certain degree, you can imagine that your Presenter looks like its code is the View itself, but for you as the developer. So that reading the interface of the Presenter is enough for you to grasp what it is doing, and what \u201cbuttons\u201d can you push (what methods can you call). And you should actually be able to do that from the debugger.The other thing Presenter does is handles your requests to transition to other screens by passing the call to your Router, give or take some relevant logic and parameters.Requirements. Expose (make public) protocol Presenter. Expose default implementation DefaultPresenter and its init method. The methods shouldn\u2019t have any callbacks. Presenter has three private properties: strong Interactor, weak View, and strong Router \u2014 passed through its constructor.Patterns. No callbacks at all, use View interface instead.Process all exceptions and errors \u2014 pass them on to a relevant View method (i.e. displayError), or crash the app, or log, or whatever you have to do.Keep naming to have a functional meaning (login()), not \u201cView\u201d meaning (loginButtonTapped(), leftGreenButtonPress(), loginAction(), etc are a no).Prefer computed properties were relevant.Provide indexed access if necessary. For example, if you have a UITableView, you can have a numberOfUsers property, and user(at index:) method.Presenter can have a defined View Model alongside it, that would contain a certain group of properties (particularly useful for cell items).Use Helpers where suitable (explained in the next section).Presenter is preferably stateless. Try to keep it that way.Imports. Presenter doesn\u2019t import anything but Helpers if necessary.Usage. Used by your View (UIViewController subclass, supposedly). Mocked by unit test of the View. Instantiated by the Router.Objectivity Check:\u2705 If View is just a console app, Presenter works right away and doesn\u2019t look wrongly placed or improperly written.\u2705 No services are required to unit-test Presenter.\u2705 Using mock Interactor simple to write a unit-test.\u2705 Simple to run integration tests on a couple of services/mocks.\u2705 No transformations required to display values returned by Presenter in a View.\u2705 No transformations required to pass values from a View to Presenter.\u274c View-related methods in Presenter interface (viewDidLoad, buttonWasTapped, etc).\u274c Imports UIKit.\u274c Throwing methods.\u274c Arguments or return values of imported types (from some Service or elsewhere).HelperThis little brat seems like the least important, yet it really helps (ha!) a lot.Basically, once you start writing your Presenters, you\u2019ll find yourself repeating lots of logic, just because you can\u2019t actually share it due to modularity. Quite obviously, this should be done with Helpers.Got some long formatting logic needed on several screens? Helper to your rescue! Need common error wrappers? Have a Helper! Got some analytics to do? Guess what?.. Helper!So yes, shared abstract logic goes to Helpers. And Helpers go to a separate framework, or a couple of those, depending on how much effort you want to put there (did you know you can import just one class from a module in Swift?).Requirements. Expose your helper and its init method.Patterns. Just use as they are. Keep them stateless and prefer value types to ensure this.Imports. May import Services if they need some Models to work.Usage. Used by your Presenters, and instantiated preferably by default in the Presenter body.Objectivity Check:\u2705 Its really just a small piece of functionality.\u274c Ties to a certain presenter.View interfaceIs that even a component? Yes, it is!But yes, it is also just an interface to the View, defined in the Module. Its main purpose is to say what a Presenter may want to do to a View. It can be anything from just reloadEverything, to a bunch of methods that start or stop some animations, show errors, apply visual effects\u2026The View interface is kinda your Presenter\u2019s delegate, but not a class-extension type delegate like most are in UIKit. It\u2019s not used for Presenter\u2019s configuration or whatever else, it is strictly limited to allow Presenter to elicit some changes on View.Requirements. Expose View protocol.Patterns. Prefer not to pass data through those methods. You have Presenter interface for data, and you need to keep it that way (just one concern for each).Imports. None.Usage. Used by your Presenters and adopted by your Views and mock Views.Objectivity Check:\u2705 Each method call creates a certain effect on View\u2705 View when described by those methods feels similar to a state machine.\u2705 You can define a console-app View by those methods.\u274c Methods that ask View for data.\u274c Properties.\u274c External types.Router interfaceThis one should be simple to understand. It is just an interface that specifies all transitions that may happen from that screen (the ones that Presenter needs, at least). It also goes into the Module, and it is, of course, required by the Presenter to know how to call Router.Requirements. Expose Router protocol.Patterns. Models may go to those methods to pass data to the next screen. Don\u2019t be shy on that, the Router is your way to go as the only component that knows other Modules.Don\u2019t even think of callbacks. I\u2019ll describe a better pattern later in this article (hint: it\u2019s called ValueService).Imports. None.Usage. Used by your Presenters and adopted by your Routers and mock Routers.Objectivity Check:\u2705 Each method call leads to a certain and definite transition.\u2705 Empty implementation in the router wouldn\u2019t have any effect on the Presenter/View.\u274c Methods have callbacks.\u274c Properties.UIThat isn\u2019t just a View. This is a lot of Views. This is one single framework that has all of your Views. All in one place.In fact, this piece is your whole app from the perspective of the UIKit. Storyboards or not, Assets, localizations, views, xibs, cells, whatever you need to make your app look great \u2014 all of it should be here.Also, that is where you can freely experiment with what and how you want to test. Since each of your Views is essentially docile, you don\u2019t need to care about any dependencies and can test away. My personal choice is to mock Presenters for each screen and then use snapshot testing in unit test to validate the design. One other approach would be to run a UI test with a suite of mock Presenters and Routers to fully test the visuals of the app.ViewFinally we are at something tangible. Obviously, this is your plain old subclass of the UIViewController. Develop it to your liking, but keep in mind that it is still isolated from everything else and from other Views as well.Your View is your visual state machine. Your View has some properties (private to itself) that directly influence something displayed on the screen. It may also invoke some actions, through user action or not. Show some stuff.Though, undeniably, the main task of the View is to properly display whatever state Presenter has and properly react to Presenter\u2019s requests.Requirements. Expose each View (your UIViewController subclass). Conform each View to the relevant View from the Module. Each View has one required property \u2014 presenter. Presenter is an optional, to allow View to be instantiated from the storyboard. Define a segue wiring method if you are going to use segues.Patterns. Prefer Views having only visual state. That is, keep any internal state in sync with visual user-facing view, don\u2019t create hidden properties without visible effect.If using segues, it may be useful to define inside the relevant View a struct named Segues that would contain all your segue ids as static consts.Consult \u201cDelayedActions\u201d pattern if you find yourself in trouble regarding Presenter actions that happened while your View wasn\u2019t on-screen.Consult \u201cRouterWire\u201d pattern if you need a way to use segues in your VIPER Toolbox app.If you need to do something to Presenter upon view creation, prefer to do this explicitly in viewDidLoad. Stay away from having a mirror-method in Presenter for delayed initialization/binding/actions. That could also happen to be a couple or more methods.Automated actions and logic around the choice of desired actions are also sensible in the View. For example, some main screen may check with Presenter to see if we are logged in or not and make a choice of transitioning to a login screen or to a home screen. This would make sense, since the decision to transition or not, to display login state or not, how to select action, and others like it are UX decisions. And them being UX is a clear indicator they should be in View, not in Presenter (which is Developer Experience, remember the \u201cView for developer\u201d I said about when writing on Presenter?).Imports. VIPER Module, UIKit.Usage. Directly used only by the Router, instantiated either by system or by the Router. Used in View Unit tests with a mock Presenter.Objectivity Check:\u2705 Repeated calls through View interface don\u2019t produce errors or undefined states.\u2705 View can work without Presenter altogether (with it being nil).\u2705 Lifting View and using it as it is without the rest of the app doesn\u2019t require any changes.\u274c View relies on being in a certain location of the UIViewController stack (i.e. it relies on being inside UINavigationController).\u274c View has non-view, non-UX logic in it.\u274c View makes use of asynchrony components (except for animations).Router and WireframeAnd now for the most complicated bit. The Router. Also, The Wireframe.Incidentally, Wireframe is our app. Not many VIPERs dare to say this. In fact, I\u2019m going so bold with VIPER Toolbox, as to put all Routers into the main bundle of the app.What is a Router and what is a Wireframe? I tend to say that Wireframe is our collection of Routers and their interactions. While the Router is a definition of a single Module/screen, how it is created in the app, and how it connects to other Routers.Your basic router is also what assembles your Module into its pristine state. And connects UI to it. And system. And all services.Depending on whether you want to have some dependency injection or not, it also may manage and store all of your services.If you are looking to use Dependency Injection, consider Cupholder. While not very mature, it is written in clean Swift and is the only known to me DI for Swift that provides scoped DI resolution, which happens to be a prerequisite to be useful in VIPER Toolbox.Your state of the art Router has one required method: build. This method may differ a lot, depending on how you structure your app. Some choices I can think of are: with storyboards or without, with segues or without, with DI or without. You get to chose, and depending on your choice the way your router will build the module will be different. But one thing will be certain \u2014 build is a static method that returns the Router instance and sets everything up. It is a static method and not a constructor, and it is such because it not only constructs its own instance, but also constructs and manages other instances.You start your app by building the router for the main screen, and that is where you pass control of your app to VIPER.Keep in mind that you are only testing your Routers as part of the UI testing of the full app. So that means there are some restrictions to what you should be doing there. Stay away from conditional logic, keep actions simple, keep build concise and don\u2019t introduce any deviations from your accepted standard implementation.Requirements. Implement build method that returns a router instance and set ups dependencies. Implement simple init method that stores the required properties in the router. Conform your Router to the Router protocol from the Module. Store your ViewController as a weak property of concrete type (not as a protocol).Optionally, define structs for Services.Patterns. Routers are stateless. Keep them that way.Consult \u201cRouterWire\u201d pattern if you need a way to use segues in your VIPER Toolbox app.Define a nested struct Services, and inside define a struct External. Use properties on Services struct to store the Services that are owned (created) by your Router. Use External to pass Services to your Router from other Routers and to store those Services.Your route methods should call build on a target router with the required parameters, but don\u2019t need (although may) store the resulting Router. Storing the resulting Router may be useful to invoke long-distance actions from other Modules, for example in a Master-Detail app layout.There are a couple of ways to build a Router. One would be to start with a system-provided ViewController: create everything else you need and assign Presenter to viewController\u2019s presenter property. You can also let Router handle the creation of the ViewController: either construct it programmatically, or invoke some system call to get it (from storyboard or xib).Services (External) should also go to the arguments of build method.Imports. VIPER Module, UIKit, your UI framework, required Services.Usage. Only used by another Router or your AppDelegate.Objectivity Check:\u2705 Nothing depends on it.\u274c Has conditional logic in route methods (routes).VIPER Toolbox LayoutAnd now to describe how all of this fits together and looks in the app.You should aim for the following app layout:Let\u2019s also see how internally this app works:Workings of VIPER ToolboxHopefully this doesn\u2019t look too complex. As it stands, this should be all interactions that you can have in your app. If you think you don\u2019t see something, check out the next section to see maybe this has a proper solution within the bounds of the design.Common PatternsWell, you have read and seen everything about how this should work. Unfortunately, this doesn\u2019t tell you much how to actually do this and you may even start seeing all the challenges you may face while implementing this architecture. But don\u2019t worry though, this is precisely why I wrote this section. Here you will find all the good and fitting solutions to common tasks you may have in your app.RouterWireLet\u2019s start with a simple one. So you, like many good iOS developers want to have storyboards with segues in your app. Every other VIPER manual tells you you can\u2019t do this in VIPER. Well, this isn\u2019t your every other VIPER manual, this is the VIPER Toolbox. You can do it, you can have segues in your VIPER.You\u2019ll need two files: RouterWire.swift goes into your wireframe, and UIViewController+Wire.swift goes into your UI.The first one contains protocol Router, which you should conform your router to. Also, having this protocol is a good idea, you\u2019ll see a couple other things with this protocol in other patterns.This protocol has a default method wireNextRouter(_ closure:), which gives you the ability to perform construction of the next Router instance when given a ViewController that is of type defined in this next Router. You can also use wireEmpty(), when you need a segue that doesn\u2019t need a Router, like an unwind segue. You use those methods by passing their return value to the sender argument of performSegue(withIdentifier:sender:) method. This also means your segues should be manual, but the fact that you have the Wireframe and also that it is the Routers that should do transitions in VIPER, you shouldn\u2019t be expecting otherwise.From the other side, you need to invoke the actual wiring method in your View. The best place to do this is, of course, prepare(for segue:) method. Just put a call to wire(segue:with:) method from UIViewController+Wire.swift in the body.Here\u2019s some example usage from the route method:3rd-party component using UIYou just got that shiny new Pod that perfectly suits your needs. And, oh no, it wants to have a UIViewController! We aren\u2019t supposed to give that in VIPER, because in VIPER this 3rd-component should be put in a Service, and shouldn\u2019t even know we have a View. So what to do?Answer is simple: Router should take care of that.Make a Service that encapsulates this 3rd-party component and stores a UIViewController as a private property. Router should give its ViewController to this Service when it is constructing it. And then the service can use this UIViewController as it sees fit, but only as a basic UIViewController \u2014 don\u2019t let it know the actual type.If you need to change the ViewController that is used for this 3rd-party service, make a wrapper Service that would conform to the required Service interface. This would be the one that has the UIViewController property. You will need the actual service, but this time it would store the state as you need, while all its methods that need to will have UIViewController as an argument.Now you have a proper Service, and your VIPER is safe.Additional UIViewControllersSometimes it is that you get a different kind of problem. That could be both by design or by common sense, or just because of natural developer laziness. Good example would be when you need a UIViewController for UISearchController.searchResultsController.This is when you don\u2019t want to have VIPER Module for a screen.Well, there isn\u2019t much to write here about this case. You just don\u2019t have the VIPER Module. But keep in mind that all your UIViewControllers should actually belong to some VIPER Screen, and never be by themself lying around. In the same example with UISearchController, this SearchResultController should belong to your screen that hosts UISearchController.Root ViewControllerA special case of the previous, is when you need a kind of root ViewController, like UINavigationController, or UITabBarController, or something else like this.The solution is slightly different, since it is usually a part of your app UI navigation, which happens to be managed by Router. So let it be managed by a Router.Keep a property rootViewController in your Router. Use when you need. That\u2019s it. Also you can consider having rootViewController in your base Router protocol.Delayed actionsOne pattern you may want to have is DelayedActions. Since you don\u2019t really control when Presenter might decide to call your View method from the perspective of the View, you may want to ensure your actions on the call are queued till the View is on-screen. Usage is simple:Define delayedActions property in your View: var delayedActions = DelayedActions(). Put delayedActions.consume() into your viewDidAppear. Put delayedActions.startDelaying() into your relevant certain-transition method (i.e. prepare(for segue:sender:)). Use delayedActions.delay { \u2026 } where needed to create a delayed action.Closing wordsObjectivity Check:\u2705 You like how your VIPER Toolbox app looks.\u274c You haven\u2019t used VIPER Toolbox in the app.Hopefully this gives you enough introduction to VIPER Toolbox. If you are considering whether you need VIPER or not, this may help you answer the question. If all of this seems too complex for you and your app \u2014 don\u2019t use it; if all seems ok and useful\u2014do, and keep in mind that most problems of other VIPERs are fixed here or circumvented in some way.Don\u2019t forget that the focus of VIPER always has been and always will be on testing. This article was already long enough, so more information on testing, with code samples and a sample project, will come in a future article. But don\u2019t expect it to be soon.Also note that VIPER Toolbox is right now in flux \u2014 I\u2019m still working out some details and figuring some other patterns useful there. I\u2019ll keep updating the article as I find something useful.PS. I got some Xcode Templates for you to help with creating VIPER Screens and UI. Here they are. Put them into ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates. Also, a couple of snippets for the Router, put those to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets.Well, thank you for reading such a long article! Let a good VIPER Toolbox be helpful to your future VIPER endeavours.It\u2019s safe.

Actually, what I did.IntroductionI was interested in iOS developing not so long ago,. When I began to read different articles about iOS, I usually saw 1 word \u2014 VIPER. I as many Android developers, I usually use Clean Architecture. And VIPER extend Clean Architecture idioms.When we using Clean Architecture in Android, we usually use MVP patterns in presentation module. I wanted to try something else, but using basically Clean Architecture idioms. I think, \u201cWhy we can\u2019t use MVVM pattern in Clean Architecture for kill explicit reference to view from our presenter?\u201d. And we can. But instead of use MVP pattern, we will be use MVVM pattern for interaction our view with business logic in presentation layer. I will show application by using Android VIPER by using avisales requests http://engine.hotellook.com/api/ .Stack of technologies:Kotlin;Databinding framework (you can replace it by LiveData);RxJava 2;Dagger 2;Retrofit 2;Cicerone (router)Clean architecture idioms;A good mood :)Let\u2019s beginData layerData layer will include POJOs and means to get Data from cloud or local storage.Data layer describe logic for retrieving data from the server. In app, we have common interface ISearchHotelLocationDataSource for remote API and database storage. Method fetchHotel takes name of hotel and limit of hotels.interface ISearchHotelLocationDataSource {    fun fetchHotel(lat: Double, lng: Double) : Observable<MutableList<Hotel>>}We have 2 implementation of it\u2019s interface. There are RemoteSearchHotelNameDataSource and DatabaseSearchHotelNameDataSource. RemoteSearchHotelNameDataSource is datasource for fetching data from Aviasales API. DatabaseSearchHotelNameDataSource is datasource for saving data to database and fetch it. In current application, I don\u2019t implement saving data into database and all classes , that depend from database is template. We have special class for convert backend\u2019s responses into UI POJO \u2014 SearchHotelNameWrapper.class RemoteSearchHotelNameDataSource @Inject constructor(var remoteApi: IRemoteApi, var wrapper: SearchHotelNameWrapper) : ISearchHotelNameDataSource {    override fun fetchHotel(query: String, limit: Int): Observable<MutableList<Hotel>> =            remoteApi.fetchHotels(query, \"ru\", \"hotel\", limit).flatMap { i -> Observable.just(wrapper.convertHotelsReponse(i)) }}class DatabaseSearchHotelNameDataSource @Inject constructor(var remoteApi: IRemoteApi) : ISearchHotelNameDataSource {    override fun fetchHotel(query: String, limit: Int): Observable<MutableList<Hotel>> {        throw UnsupportedOperationException(\"Operation is not available!!!\")    }}Class RemoteSearchHotelNameDataSource takes remoteApi object. This is usual interface of retrofit.interface IRemoteApi {    @GET(\"v2/lookup.json\")    fun fetchHotels(@Query(\"query\") query: String, @Query(\"lang\") lang: String, @Query(\"lookup\") lookup: String,@Query(\"limit\") limit: Int) : Observable<HotelResultReponse>}We have class SearchHotelNameFactory. This factory that help\u2019s up fetch data from remote API or database storage. Here I don\u2019t implement any logic for detect from where fetch data from api or database, that\u2019s by default data fetched from@Singletonclass SearchHotelNameFactory @Inject constructor(val remoteSearchHotelNameDataSource: RemoteSearchHotelNameDataSource,val databaseSearchHotelNameDataSource: DatabaseSearchHotelNameDataSource) {    fun fetchRemoteApi() = remoteSearchHotelNameDataSource    fun fetchDatabaseApi() = databaseSearchHotelNameDataSource}We have repository for connect our domain layer with data layer. Our SearchHotelNameRepository takes a factory for decide from where get\u2019s data from API or database. For this, we have isOffline variable.class SearchHotelNameRepository @Inject constructor(var factory: SearchHotelNameFactory)  : ISearchHotelNameRepository {    override fun fetchHotelsApi(query: String, limit: Int,  isOffline: Boolean): Observable<MutableList<Hotel>> = factory.fetchStorage(isOffline).fetchHotel(query, limit)}Domain layerDomain layer will include all business logic and interact between Data and Presentation layer by means of interface and interactors. The objective is to make the domain layer independent of anything, so the business logic can be tested without any dependency to external components.This layer saved all information about entities, use cases, interfaces of repositories. All POJO is saved into domain layer. There are Hotel (UI POJO), HotelResponse (Backend POJO)data class Hotel(var locationId: Int, var fullName: String, var label: String, var _score: Double, var id: String, var locationName: String) : Parcelable {    constructor(parcel: Parcel) : this(            parcel.readInt(),            parcel.readString(),            parcel.readString(),            parcel.readDouble(),            parcel.readString(),            parcel.readString()) {    }    override fun writeToParcel(parcel: Parcel, flags: Int) {        parcel.writeInt(locationId)        parcel.writeString(fullName)        parcel.writeString(label)        parcel.writeDouble(_score)        parcel.writeString(id)        parcel.writeString(locationName)    }    override fun describeContents(): Int {        return 0    }    companion object CREATOR : Parcelable.Creator<Hotel> {        override fun createFromParcel(parcel: Parcel): Hotel {            return Hotel(parcel)        }        override fun newArray(size: Int): Array<Hotel?> {            return arrayOfNulls(size)        }    }}We have base class of UseCase that named as UseCase :) This class takes working scheduler for detect, how execute our queries and observer scheduler by default it\u2019s AndroidSchedulers.mainThread().abstract class QueryUseCase<R, T> protected constructor(private val mWorkScheduler: Scheduler, private val mObserveScheduler: Scheduler) {    fun run(params: T): Observable<R> {        return buildUseCaseObservable(params)                .subscribeOn(mWorkScheduler)                .observeOn(mObserveScheduler)    }    protected abstract fun buildUseCaseObservable(params: T): Observable<R>}SearchHotelNameUseCase is use case (interactor) for searching hotels by name in API. This use case takes name of hotel, and limit of queries.class SearchHotelNameUseCase @Inject constructor(workScheduler: Scheduler, observeScheduler: Scheduler, private val repository: ISearchHotelNameRepository) : QueryUseCase<MutableList<Hotel>, SearchHotelNameUseCase.FetchHotelNameParam>(workScheduler, observeScheduler) {    override fun buildUseCaseObservable(params: FetchHotelNameParam): Observable<MutableList<Hotel>> {        return repository.fetchHotelsApi(params.query, params.limit, params.isOffline)    }    class FetchHotelNameParam(query: String, limit: Int, isOffline: Boolean) {        internal var query: String        internal var limit: Int        internal var isOffline: Boolean        init {            this.query = query            this.limit = limit            this.isOffline = isOffline        }    }}Presentation layerPresentation layer will include normal Activities and Fragments, which will only handle rendering views and will follow MVVM pattern.Our UI represent fragment_search_hotel_name.xml. This layout has reference for ViewModel that need to interact on UI behavior. I imported View for show / hide progress bar panel.<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?><layout    xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"    xmlns:app=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto\"    xmlns:bind=\"http://schemas.android.com/tools\">    <data>        <import type=\"android.view.View\"/>        <variable            name=\"model\"            type=\"com.example.knifestart.hotelsnights.searchhotelbyname.SearchHotelNameViewModel\"/>    </data>    <android.support.constraint.ConstraintLayout        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"        android:layout_height=\"match_parent\">        <android.support.v4.widget.SwipeRefreshLayout            android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"            android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"            app:refreshing=\"@{model.progressVisible}\"            app:onRefreshListener=\"@{() -> model.refreshHotels()}\">            <android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView                android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"                android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"                bind:postBindAdapter=\"@{model}\"                bind:setHasFixedSize=\"@{true}\"                bind:space=\"@{16}\"                bind:scrollPagination=\"@{model}\"                android:padding=\"16dp\"/>        </android.support.v4.widget.SwipeRefreshLayout>        <FrameLayout            android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"            android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"            app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf=\"parent\"            app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf=\"parent\"            app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf=\"parent\"            android:visibility=\"@{model.progressVisible ?

We need only send according screen name key.router.navigateTo(screenKey)ConclusionsGoal of the article is show how implement VIPER in Android by using MVVM presentation layer.

There is a host of options available, and two solid ones seem to be Private Internet Access (PIA) and VyprVPN. PIA claims they absolutely do not keep any logs at all \u2013 you\u2019ll just have to believe them. VyprVPN do log some information for 30 days, and claims that a no-logging policy makes it difficult to provide a reliable service, and that what the users should be aiming for is full transparency from their VPN provider.The way I see it, at the end of the day, it comes down to trust. Do you trust that PIA never logs anything? Do you trust that VyprVPN keeps to their logging policy?I recently came across a deal on VyprVPN. I proceeded to read quite a bit about them on their website (which is highly informative and well laid out), and considered switching to them from PIA. The fly in the ointment: They do keep logs, and I am currently using a service which claims to not keep any logs at all. I contacted the two companies and we sent some emails back and forth, and below is the email correspondence.The bottom line: While VyprVPN is very transparent on their website, they seemed somewhat evasive in their answers. PIA was more open and forthright in addressing my questions.Let me just say first that I am in no way affiliated with VyprVPN or PIA. With that out of the way, let\u2019s get started:Contacting VyprVPNIn my initial email to VyprVPN, I questioned why VyprVPN was keeping logs for 30 days, containing source IP, VyprVPN IP, and timestamp. Wouldn\u2019t this enable people with access to the logs to trace my activity?Hi! I heard about you through your deal with SpiderOak.In your privacy policy, you say the following:\u201cEach time a user connects to VyprVPN, we retain the following data for 30 days: the user\u2019s source IP address, the VyprVPN IP address used by the user, connection start and stop time and total number of bytes used.\u201dIsn\u2019t that rather serious? Doesn\u2019t that mean that anyone with access to the logs (governments with subpoenas, hackers, or you yourselves) can identify me and link me and my \u201cprivate\u201d IP to my traffic usage at the other end of the VPN? If I do something that a government is not very fond of, and they log my external IP and get access to your logs within 30 days, doesn\u2019t that mean that I am implicated? If this is the case, forgive me the harsh statement, it hardly seems worth using your VPN service, especially since there are VPN services that do not log anything at all. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong. I am currently using Private Internet Access VPN. I am not completely happy with the service (AFAIK they don\u2019t have their own DNS [they do in fact have their own no-logging DNS, but I didn\u2019t know at the time] \u2013 they have DNS leak protection, but that causes connectivity problems for me), but they do not keep any logs at all and allow completely anonymous payment options (gift cards, etc.). That way I am guaranteed that my activity and external IP in no way can be linked to me.In their reply they copy-pasted from their VPN myths page the entirety of Myth #7 (about why some logging is good) and Myth 4 (warning against \u201cno-log\u201d services, saying you are not anonymous anyway and questioning the validity and technical feasability of the no-log policy), ending on a courteous \u201cI hope this has cleared up some issues for you. If you have any more questions, please do not hesitate to let us know.\u201dI did not hesitate to let them know. I reworded my main point and asked quite clearly whether you could be traced by anyone with access to the logs \u2013 I wanted a clear answer to this.Thank you, it clears up but not all of it. My main question still remains. Let\u2019s say I do something which some government or authority does not approve of. Could be anything \u2013 criticizing dictators, pirating a movie, planning world dominion. They log the IP that they can see, which is my VyprVPN IP. Is it then true that they can potentially get access to the logs (e.g. subpoena, hacking), connect my VyprVPN IP to my source IP, and trace the source IP back to me and identify me?They got back to me saying that they will not hand out data unless \u201cdirected to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction in the matter\u201d, which is definitely not a \u201cno\u201d:We apologize for the confusion. Golden Frog will not sell or otherwise release a member\u2019s identifying information \u2014 minimal information reasonably calculated to identify and no more \u2014 or usage information to investigators, attorneys, or agencies unless we are directed to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction in the matter. If there is a hearing in court, the member will be notified so they will have an opportunity to contest the surrender of personal information.Golden Frog cooperates fully with law enforcement agencies, yet there must still be a subpoena before Golden Frog provides a member\u2019s identifying information \u2014 minimal information reasonably calculated to identify and no more. In a criminal investigation Golden Frog is required by the Law to not divulge the fact of the investigation to the member.You can find out more on our private policy which can be found on the link below.http://www.goldenfrog.com/privacyIf you have further questions please reply to this email! Thanks again.Really trying to get a clear answer from VyprVPNThey seemed really reluctant to say \u201cyes, you can be tracked by anyone with access to logs\u201d, but at the same time they definitely did not say it was impossible. Although I felt fairly sure it was possible by now, I was determined to try to get an answer to the question one more time. I phrased it as a statement and an example to check my understanding, and also inquired as to why exactly they log both the source and external IP:Again, thank you for the good answer. I want to put out two statements check my understanding. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong. Finally, I will put forth a question regarding this topic. In your reply, I would appreciate if you could address each of these statements/questions in a concrete manner.Statement 1: Based on the first reply I got from you (citing your website), I understand why some kind of logging has to take place to deliver a reliable service. But I don\u2019t understand why you have to log, specifically, both the source IP and external (VyprVPN) IP. It seems to me that if you do not log any single one of these two IPs, there is no possibility of identifying the user through you, and thus the user can feel much safer. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong here.Statement 2 (example): A user lives in a country with severe internet censorship and with effectively a government ban on freedom of speech. Consider a user in that country operating through your service, criticizing the government. The government of course deems this unlawful and logs the external (VyprVPN) IP of the user. If I understand correctly, the government can then (within 30 days) subpoena for your logs, connect their logged (VyprVPN) IP to the user\u2019s source IP, identify the user, and take any kind of abominable action against the user. In this case, the user was implicated even though they used VyprVPN to spread important critical information on the government. Again, if you (VyprVPN) did not log either one of the two IPs, the government, even with access to the logs, would have no way of tracing the external (VyprVPN) IP back to the user. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong here.Specific question: Why, exactly, do you have to log both the source IP and external (VyprVPN) IP? Could you go into details as to what, specifically, this permits you to do that would otherwise be impossible?It came as no surprise that the answer was not very detailed and ended on \u201cwe\u2019re not able to address your hypothetical situations directly\u201d:Thank you for your reply! We\u2019ll be happy to address your concerns. We log both the source IP and external IP in order to ensure that our service is not used for abusive purposes. Abusive purposes includes anything prohibited by our terms of service. You can view that here:http://www.goldenfrog.com/terms-of-serviceIn short, we log IPs to maintain order on our network and ensure quality service for our users.It sounds like you\u2019re asking about a service that makes you anonymous. You are not anonymous when you are online, even when using privacy tools like Tor, Bitcoin, or a VPN. Every service has at least one piece of information that can be used to distinguish different users, whether it\u2019s a set of IP addresses (VPN and Tor) or a wallet (Bitcoin). This information alone may not reveal any private details about the user, but it can be associated with other similar information to eventually identify an individual.I hope this clears up the situation a little. While we\u2019re not able address your hypothetical situations directly, we try to explain our policies in the context of our belief in a free and open Internet for users in all countries as well as our respect for the rule of law.I now gave up on ever trying to get a clear answer to the traceability while using VyprVPN. I\u2019m pretty sure that it\u2019s fully possible.Contacting Private Internet AccessI did however send an email to PIA, bringing forth the questions from VyprVPN\u2019s Myth 4 (where they rhetorically question how VPN providers are able to operate without logging). I didn\u2019t get a copy of my initial questions (submitted through a form on their website), but their response (woven into my questions) were:Thanks for contacting us. I have addressed each of your questions below:1. If you have some limit to the number of connections per user, how is this possible without logging?***The connections are limited by the number of active log in sessions. The time the login was authenticated, the length of the connection, and other such details are never recorded. The server has to be able to see that you are logged in in order to provide the connection, but the details of your log in are never saved anywhere.***2. How can you troubleshoot my connection or offer support for server side problems without logging?***Debugging information is different from the logs that could be used to track user activities. It is possible to compile a debugging report without compromising the security and privacy of our users. Also, a log of possible connection issues is stored locally on your computer, and can be sent to us by you if you so choose. The information compiled there is specifically related to errors that might appear when OpenVPN tries to connect. The information about your computer is extremely limited, and possible to exclude if you so choose.***3. How can you handle my DNS requests when using the VPN service without logging? Do you rely on a 3rd Party DNS provider that may log DNS requests?***The VPN assigns our DNS servers to your computer, so all DNS requests are automatically routed through our servers. The DNS servers that we use do not log, and are not hosted by a third party.***4. How do you prevent abuse, such as spammers, port scanners, and DDOS to protect your VPN service and your users without logging?***When these activities are reported to us, we have proprietary methods available to deal with these issues without compromising the security and privacy of other users. I apologize, but I am not able to share more details regarding this, as these methods are part of the reason that we are able to offer a truly log free service that is not inundated with spammers and the like, and revealing them would cost us our competitive edge.***5. Is it at all possible to trace me by IP when using the service? Am I anonymous as far as my IP go? For example, other VPN providers might log my external IP, source IP and timestamp for some amount of time, which would allow my activity to be traced back to me by people with access to the logs (e.g. governments with subpoenas, hackers, etc.)***No, it is in no way possible to track your IP address through the VPN. When you connect to the VPN, all internet traffic is routed through the VPN IP address. Hackers, trackers, and anyone else will see the VPN IP address when trying to track you, and they will not be able to track you past the VPN\u2019s IP address.***6. In your Terms of Service, you write: \u201cFailure to comply with the present Terms of Service \u2026 may result in one or more of these following actions: \u201c whereafter you write, among other things,\u201cLegal actions against you for reimbursement of any costs incurred via indemnity resulting from a breach\u201dand\u201cDisclosure of such information to law enforcement authorities as deemed reasonably necessary\u201d.6a) How are these actions possible unless you log?***As mentioned previously, we do have proprietary methods for dealing with situations involving ToS violations.***6b) Is this just legal boilerplate without any practical effect since you (presumably) do not log anything, and therefore are unable to perform any of these actions?***I can assure you that our Terms of Service will be enforced if necessary. However, actual instances of having to do this are extremely rare.***6c) Are you really unable to perform any of these actions?***We can and if necessary will perform all actions in our Terms of Service to ensure that the VPN remains viable for all users. However, as I mentioned above, the actual need for enforcing the ToS is extremely rare.***I hope you find my answers satisfactory, and would be happy to provide further information if necessary.In a follow-up email I wondered whether PIA had any way of listening in on the traffic. My question was elevated to Tier 2 tech support, who could assure me that \u201cWe have no ability to see what you are doing on the VPN. The traffic is heavily encrypted, and even our server admins cannot see the traffic that is passing.\u201dAnyway, I brought the answers from PIA back to VyprVPN, and they only repliedThank you for your reply. The answers from our competitor appear to boil down to:\u201cThat\u2019s proprietary information, and I can\u2019t tell what we\u2019re doing with your data.\u201dGolden Frog is open about what we do with your data and why. If you have any more questions about our service or why we log, please let us know.Which, competitors or not, is a fair point. I cannot see any way of dealing with ToS violations judicially without evidence in the form of logs. While I don\u2019t have any special knowledge of judicial processes, this fact could easily make my trust in PIA falter.However, I recently came across a subpoena request to PIA and PIA\u2019s response, where they make it absolutely clear, under penalty of law, that they did not have logs that far back (2 months). While this is no guarantee for not keeping any logs at all, it is enough for me to keep my trust in PIA\u2019s no-log policy.Final ThoughtsChoosing a VPN provider, or anything related to security, is a matter of trust. I appreciate the fact that PIA has proprietary methods to make their no-log policy work. It does not really seem any worse than VyprVPN being open about keeping logs. Even though they claim transparency above all, you still have to trust the information just the same as you have to trust PIA in their no-logging policy. Besides, some of the information on the VyprVPN website concerning no-logging VPN providers seem to me like little else than rank fearmongering \u2013 keeping PIA\u2019s answers in mind, VyprVPN don\u2019t really provide good arguments for why logging is a technical necessity.In the end, I am sticking with PIA.

The study that they are citing, though factually true, isn\u2019t true for real world vaping. The scientists tested their ecigarette at a very high voltage of 5.0, which no vaper would actually use with a coil temperature of 1,112 degrees Fahrenheit. This temperature, which you can imagine, would cause the eliquid to burn and would lead to an undesirable burnt taste that all vapers try to avoid. Ecig users vape at the normal coil temperature between 392\u2013500 degrees Fahrenheit. As you can see, the coil the researchers tested was over double the real world coil temperature that vapers use.\u201cAren\u2019t vaping and smoking the same thing?\u201dActually, vaping is NOT smoking. Smoking involves combustion or the burning of tobacco leaves. Whereas vaping involves heating up (vaporizing) a liquid to create vapor. There is absolutely no combustion involved. Cigarettes also contain over 4,000 chemicals and 43 of those chemicals are known carcinogens and 400 other known toxins. Eliquid in quality ecigarettes only have four ingredients and these four ingredients have all been FDA approved.\u201cDo you even know what\u2019s in that juice?\u201dBut we do, unlike with tobacco cigarettes. Eliquids are composed of up to four main ingredients, a main base of propylene glycol, which has been on the FDA\u2019s generally recognized as safe (GRAS) list and has been used in many products that consumers use daily, like albuterol or in asthma inhalers. PG is a perfect carrier of flavorings and offers the throat hit that smokers enjoy. The second ingredient is vegetable glycerin which is also on the FDA\u2019s GRAS list and like PG is also used in many products that people use / consume daily. VG, unlike PG does not hold flavor very well and is much thicker in consistency, but it does produce thick clouds when vaporized. This is why most manufacturers of eliquids use a combination of both PG and VG as their base as it affords both characteristics needed for a perfect vape. The third ingredient in eliquid are flavorings, these are always food-grade and can be natural or artificial, they are the same type of flavorings that are use in the food and beverages people consume everyday. The final ingredient is liquid nicotine. The liquid nicotine used is pharmaceutical grade and affords eliquid makers to create bottles that range in nicotine content depending on the user\u2019s preference.\u201cHave you heard the latest ecigarette news story?\u201dDon\u2019t believe everything you hear on the news or read on the Internet, those scaremongering articles and stories aren\u2019t always true. But the fact is most people do not have time or the attention span to go digging for the truth regarding articles they read or news they hear on the TV or radio and they simply accept them as reliable and true.\u201cDon\u2019t those blow up in your face?\u201dMost of the ecigarette malfunctions that you hear about are due to misuse where the user failed to follow the instructions of the manufacturer. The very few reports of ecigarettes that have failed during use or charging was because the user tried to charge their ecigarette with a charger that did not come with their kit. For mechanical mods, that is a little different. When a new user first asks about a mechanical mod, the first thing a more experienced user will tell them is to make sure that they do their research first and very thoroughly. Mechanical mods do not come with electrical protections; they are called unregulated because of this. Mods are really only suitable for those who have done their research and know what they are doing.Read the entire article about \u201c5 Questions That All Vapers Are Sick Of Hearing\u201d where it was orginally published here.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Ecigarettes", "Vaping", "Quit Smoking"]}, {"title": "Vyprofilovan\u00fd firemn\u00fd n\u00e1zor ako konkuren\u010dn\u00e1 marketingov\u00e1 v\u00fdhoda a n\u00e1stroj na z\u00edskanie 'spr\u00e1vnych' z\u00e1kazn\u00edkov", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@wilderko/vyprofilovan%C3%BD-firemn%C3%BD-n%C3%A1zor-ako-konkuren%C4%8Dn%C3%A1-marketingov%C3%A1-v%C3%BDhoda-a-n%C3%A1stroj-na-z%C3%ADskanie-spr%C3%A1vnych-z-7112fc38a4bf?source=search_post", "author_name": "Pavol Luptak", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@wilderko", "publish_date": "2017-09-03", "last_modified_date": "2017-09-16", "readtime": "1.41", "claps": 6, "voters": 5, "content": "Vyprofilovan\u00fd firemn\u00fd n\u00e1zor ako konkuren\u010dn\u00e1 marketingov\u00e1 v\u00fdhoda a n\u00e1stroj na z\u00edskanie 'spr\u00e1vnych' z\u00e1kazn\u00edkovPavol LuptakFollowSep 3, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readObvykle, ak chcete ako firma maximalizova\u0165 mno\u017estvo svojich klientov, je vhodn\u00e9 vystupova\u0165 \u010do najviac neutr\u00e1lne a politicky\u00a0korektne.Nov\u00fd biznis toti\u017e m\u00f4\u017ee 'kvapn\u00fa\u0165' od hocikadia\u013e.

Often they look different in appearance but perform the same basic functions. Let\u2019s take a look at their different parts:A battery. This powers the device or Mod. Some devices use an integrated battery while others use replaceable cells.An atomizer or the part containing the heating element. It heats up the e-liquid which causes the liquid to vaporise and then to be inhaled.Coils are a replaceable section of wire that has been wound into a spring-like coil shape. The coils are then wicked with an absorbent material, like cotton, which absorbs the e-liquid. The wire coils are then heated to vaporise the e-liquid on the wicks.A tank or the part containing the e-liquid storage material.A tasteful e-liquid. A mixture of propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, flavourings, and CBDII / Richer You Will BeA common question among people considering the changeover is if it is going to save them money in the short and long term. So let\u2019s make the math!At \u20ac10 a pack for seven days, cigarettes will cost you \u20ac70. The price of e-liquid varies greatly but \u20ac10 buys you a bottle that could last you (depending on how often you vape) anywhere from one day to a couple of weeks, allowing you to save about \u20ac60 per week or \u20ac250 per month (\u20ac3000 per year!!) by switching over to e-cigs vs. cigarettes!Not convinced? See by yourself by making your own savings calculation hereConsidering the short-term savings of switching over to e-cigs, you can easily imagine the long term implications of choosing e-smoking on your bank account. Being able to buy cartridges and e-liquids in multiples that will last longer for the same average prices means you will increase your savings and also means no rushing out in awful weather to get another pack.It is clear that e-smoking is cheaper both in the long and short term for smokers.III / Educated You Will BeWithout clear studies about how vaporisation could impact your health, the e-cigarette can at least limit the damage by replacing the 4000 known chemicals in cigarettes down to just the 4 main elements that make up e-liquids:Propylene Glycol \u2014 It carries flavour more effectively than VG.Vegetal Glycerin \u2013VG is exclusively derived from plants (soybeans or palm). It is thicker than Propylene glycol. It produces better vapour than PG and is a great sweetener as well.Flavours \u2014 You can literally pick from thousands, there is something to suit everyone\u2019s taste. Choosing is like standing in the middle of a candy store. E-juice usually contains 5\u201320 % flavour. E-liquid manufacturers will use either natural or artificial flavouring, Harmony e-liquids have their flavours extracted from the original cannabis strains.CBD or Nicotine depends on your preference. Unlike nicotine-based e-liquid, CBD concentration can vary massively in strength going from 25mg to 1000mg per bottle.IV / Grateful Your Throat Will BeIf you select a zero nicotine e-liquid like Harmony, you will notice that the throat hit is nowhere near as strong as from a tobacco cigarette. A higher nicotine level seems to lead to a harsher vape and an increased likelihood of coughing.Nevertheless, new e-cig users may experience a few minor side effects as they become accustomed to vaping. Here is what you should do to spare your throat:Check your nicotine level: It may be too high. If you are using a very strong nicotine strength, go down a level and see how it feels.Monitor your vaping style. If you are puffing deeper, longer or more frequently than you smoked traditional cigarettes, you could be irritating your throat.Drink water to help soothe your throat, and consider consuming beverages that can moisturise your throat, such as tea with honey and lemon.V / Security You Won\u2019t ForgetAn e-cigarette is a hi-tech device that is heating up and working with combustion. Safety is a major concern you should have when switching to vaping.It is very important that you read the instructions that come with your vape pen. You have to know how to use the batteries properly, especially when using sub ohm atomisers on mechanical and unregulated mods.Forums are also a great way to ask questions about safety and learn through other people\u2019s experiences.VI/ Your Device You Will UnderstandHow Exactly does the electronic cigarette work? We couldn\u2019t explain it better than our colleague from howtovap.com:\u201cThe cartridge holds the liquid. When the cartridge is inserted into the e-cig, the cartridge filler (polyester soaked in e-liquid/juice) makes contact with the atomiser\u2019s bridge. Using gravity and capillary action, the juice is absorbed via the atomiser bridge into the atomiser\u2019s steel mesh reservoir where it sits. This is when user input is required. When the user inhales on the e-cig, this action \u201cpulls\u201d the liquid from the atomiser\u2019s reservoir into the ceramic atomiser pot. This liquid is then absorbed by the aromatic polyimide wick (which is situated inside the ceramic pot). At the same time, the device is heating the coil around the wick and therefore heating the liquid until it becomes a vapour. This vapour is drawn up through the e-cig and out of the mouthpiece. \u201cQuestions?VII / Vaping You Will LearnThe first e-cigarette puff is often a surprise for new vapers. The technique for puffing on an electronic cigarette is much different than smoking a tobacco cigarette. Don\u2019t worry, we are here to help you!Before turning on your device, make sure it is legal if you are in a public place! Not all places will allow you to vape.Hit the fire button (if there is one), put the mouthpiece to your mouth, and inhale; keep in mind that you\u2019re not going to have to inhale as hard as you do with a traditional cigarette. Many smokers like to do a \u201cprimer puff\u201d to warm up the atomiser of their device. To do so, the first puff you take will be quick to heat up the coil but without the intention of pulling everything.WARNING:When a normal cigarette has been fully smoked, the cherry reaches the butt and you know it is finished and throw it out. With e-cigs, the battery doesn\u2019t shrink as you\u2019re vaping. So how are you supposed to know when you have had enough?Of course, you can go out with your smoker friends and initially use this as a guage to know when to stop. But what will you do the first time you smoke alone? The thing is, you\u2019ll still get a nicotine rush, so you have to rely on your body to let you know when enough is enough. The general rule of thumb is that the higher nicotine concentrations should be vaped in shorter bursts than the lower ones.VIII / A Vape Sucker You Won\u2019t BeA common mistake among new users is to flood the tank trying the suck the vape. E-liquid is drawn up through the tube and into your mouth.With time, you will find your own rhythm and style but remember to draw the vaporisation in a slow and smooth way.The draw you take should not be unlike a normal breath you would take while puckering your lips and inhaling. Remember the average vape is five seconds, not two seconds.IX / The Taste You Will LoveToday, with the e-cigarette trend hitting the market, users have the choice between a great range of vape pens, e-liquids and tastes. You can choose from creme brul\u00e9e flavour to coffee or even french fries. Harmony e-liquids, for example, allows you to taste original cannabis terpenes.Your final choice will depend on your personal requirements, smoking habit and flavour preferences.Remember that to optimise the taste of your e-liquid it is important to clean your device well or to switch to new equipment when you switch flavours.X/ Quitting You Will TryDespite our enthusiasm about vaping, it is important to note that vaping is neither safe nor healthy, but we believe it\u2019s an alternative to traditional smoking. Vaping has been proven to be one of the most effective devices for getting off the \u201cstickies\u201d. Last year the Cochrane collaboration published a review of evidence looking at whether e-cigarettes can help someone stop smoking, and if they are safe to use for that purpose.As more research is conducted, the effectiveness of e-cigarettes as an aid to quit smoking will become better understood.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Vaping", "Smoking", "E Cigarette", "Cbd", "Vaporiser"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@nzaghini/hi-simon-thanks-a-lot-67f010c0e88d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Nicola Zaghini", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@nzaghini", "publish_date": "2015-11-28", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-13", "readtime": "1.47", "claps": 4, "voters": 4, "content": "Hi Nicola, really interesting article.1Simon CoulterNicola ZaghiniFollowNov 28, 2015 \u00b7 2 min readHow to actually reuse a (B)VIPER Module on iOS AppsHi Simon, thanks a lot!Yes the key for reusability lives in the Builder and that\u2019s why it is so important to be part of the name of the architecture itself :-)Let\u2019s assume in our example you want to reuse the List Module within a custom hosting application. Once you have included the List Module in your project, you can simply re-write (or in some cases subclass) the components of the Module by conforming to the components\u2019 protocol.The Wireframe is always re-written since it won\u2019t be aware of the next VC (or Module) in your hosting app.Once that is done you will have to re-write or subclass the Module Builder in order to inject the right implementations. From that moment on just use the new Builder and it is done.This is a possible Module structure:And this a possible TyphoonListModuleBuilder:It is quite simple to create a custom Builder that just re-implements the wireframe method like so:This is an example with Typhoon as dependency injection (syntax can be weird at the beginning) but of course could work even without it.Hope is more clear :)", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Typhoon Ios", "iOS App Development", "Software Engineering"]}, {"title": "The Black List Interview: Andrew Crabtree", "post_link": "https://blog.blcklst.com/the-black-list-interview-andrew-crabtree-a43342c24652?source=search_post", "author_name": "Kate Hagen", "author_link": "https://blog.blcklst.com/@thathagengrrl", "publish_date": "2017-03-22", "last_modified_date": "2018-03-30", "readtime": "5.55", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "The Black List Interview: Andrew CrabtreeToday, we talk with Andrew Crabtree (INHERIT THE VIPER) about how the past, present, and future have shaped his journey as a writer.Kate HagenFollowMar 22, 2017 \u00b7 6 min readThe PastWhat was the first film that had a major impact on your life?I grew up during the golden age of the Disney musical. ALADDIN, THE LION KING, POCAHONTAS, THE LITTLE MERMAID, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. So those were no doubt really influential to me \u2014 without me being any the wiser. Also, undoubtedly, planted the seeds for my love of musical theatre as well.Was there a single film that made you want to be a screenwriter? How else did the decision to pursue that career evolve?Sadly, no. I want to say that \u201cI saw STAR WARSand knew right away that I would either become a Jedi\u2026 or a screenwriter\u201d but that\u2019s not even close to being accurate. (Though I am still waiting for my invitation to Hogwarts, but that\u2019s a whole other issue). Truth be told, I slowly wandered my way into it. I wrote short stories and song lyrics as a kid. And, separate from that, I really liked playing around with media software (Photoshop, video editing, animation, web design, architectural design, you name it). Eventually the world of \u2018telling stories\u2019 and the world of \u2018making shit on my computer\u2019 came together in the form of filmmaking. It all spawned from there.Most writers have to have \u201cday jobs\u201d in order to stay afloat. What was the strangest job you ever had before becoming a writer?Lets not kid ourselves. I still have a day job. I freelance as an editor \u2014 largely on commercial or branded web content. Being able to not have a day job is a huge goal but it still feels very far off. I haven\u2019t had any \u201cstrange\u201d jobs per se, but when I was in college I worked at an ice arena. I taught ice skating to kids \u2014 and hungover college students \u2014 and, most notably, drove the zamboni. Which is very cool\u2026 for people who actually know what a zamboni is.The PresentHow do you find ideas and how do you choose which ones to work on?I don\u2019t think anybody really knows how to find ideas. They just kind of hit you without warning. If there was an app like Pokemon Go where I could use my smartphone to find ideas out in the wild, it would make millions. But \u201chow to choose\u201d is one of the hardest parts. I struggle with this a lot. What I\u2019ve resorted to lately is sort of a trial of attrition. If an idea keeps me interested for long enough\u2026 then I\u2019ll start to brainstorm on it and tinker with it\u2026 and if it keeps developing and growing then I\u2019ll keep working at it. But most of them die off because they just don\u2019t have the legs.The hard part is recognizing when you\u2019re forcing it.\u201cBut this idea is so cool!\u201d\u201cI know, man\u2026 but it\u2019s not a movie.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s cool!\u201dI have that exchange about once a month. The best strategy is to have smart, honest friends to share your brain with.Walk us through a normal day of writing for you. Any special habits to keep the muse happy?I don\u2019t know if there is a \u201cnormal\u201d writing day for me. I wish I could just sit down \u2014 write \u2014 and then stand up eight hours later, mischief managed. But that\u2019s not even close. Usually it would start with a solid hour or so of procrastinating (lots of cleaning, eating, and watching movie trailers.) And then I actually do have a fair number of specific habits. I create a music playlist for each project I\u2019m working on. Usually I try to get a little over an hour of music \u2014 largely from scores/ soundtracks. It helps me focus on the task at hand and it helps keep me in the same tonal headspace from day to day. I I also have a tendency to turn off all of the lights, aside from the lamp on my desk. Mostly because I\u2019m a weirdo\u2026 but also because I\u2019m so easily distracted. If there are lights on in my living room\u2026 I can see all the fun things I could be doing like watching tv, reading a book, or sitting in that other chair. If the lights are off, it\u2019s easier for me to ignore the fact that there is something (anything) I could be doing besides writing\u2026 I also play white noise through an app called Coffitivity. So, essentially, \u201cwriting\u201d is just me waging a war against distraction. A war I don\u2019t always win.Which films are keeping you inspired at the moment?I think the strongest film of the year was MOONLIGHT. It was incredibly powerful. Confident, assured filmmaking that defied convention in a lot of ways. It was really effecting to me. I was also really into ARRIVAL. In the era of destruction porn films, it\u2019s so refreshing to see a smart, intimate sci-fi film. And very well done. A quick shoutout also to the underrated THE NICE GUYS and the incredibly under-talked-about SWISS ARMY MAN. I also re-watched CHILDREN OF MEN recently as it hit its 10th anniversary and that may be one of my favorites of all time. Sadly poignant right about now\u2026The FutureIf you could make one film, with no restrictions in place, what would that film be?For the sake of my sanity, I\u2019m not going to overthink this\u2026 the first thing that pops into my head is JEKYLL & HYDE. The full musical version. Leaning into the very dark reality of that story.What would you be doing if you weren\u2019t a writer?Honestly, probably working hard to get other writers\u2019 work produced. But since that feels like a bit of a cheat\u2026 I\u2019ll share my other answer as well: Live in a cabin in the woods, subsisting on coffee and bourbon, building handmade furniture, and growing an epic beard. Because, duh.Dinner with three of your favorite writers and/or filmmakers, dead or alive. Who\u2019s coming to dinner? Who picks up the check?I think it would be super awkward to invite a dead person to dinner\u2026 but since you asked, I would have to say Shakespeare. I\u2019ve got some questions for that dude. Also maybe John Logan? Maybe Danny Boyle? Martin McDonagh? Lin-Manuel Miranda? Jason Robert Brown? Michael Chabon? And, honestly, Chuck Lorre. I think he would be an incredibly interesting creative mind to talk to. And Chuck is definitely picking up the check. I know that\u2019s more than three\u2026 but we can invite them all and inevitably they won\u2019t all be able to make it. Scheduling and what not. And if they all show up\u2026 Chuck can handle paying for all of us. We can go dutch on the booze if he\u2019s being a tight-ass.The Black ListHow did you first hear about The Black List?I used to consume an unhealthy amount of podcasts/blogs about screenwriting. I\u2019m sure it was blasted all across those when it first came out. I was pretty stoked to try it out once it launched.Since using The Black List, how has your career been impacted?I\u2019d been using The Black List for years as a resource without too much impact. But last fall, I posted my newest feature screenplay, INHERIT THE VIPER, and within a few weeks of hosting it was found by a director in Switzerland who was very interested in it. The two of us were connected through the site and we\u2019ve developed the material together over the last few months which led to his production company formally buying an option on the material and we\u2019ll be spending 2017 trying to get the film made.Any tips for writers interested in the site?Write.Keep writing.Share the work, learn from it, get better, and then write more.The Black List is a great resource and should be one of many tools in a writer\u2019s toolkit. It is a uniquely positioned way to share your material (in a market full of posers and frauds). But it doesn\u2019t \u2014 by itself \u2014 elevate your material. Only you can do that. So keep writing. And when you have material you\u2019re proud of, jump onto The Black List and share that material.And then get right back to writing.Thanks, Andrew!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Film", "Screenwriting", "The Black List", "The Black List Interview", "Interview"]}, {"title": "(10/100) Hodnocen\u00ed j\u00edzdy autobusem", "post_link": "https://medium.com/100-dni-napadu/10-100-hodnocen%C3%AD-j%C3%ADzdy-autobusem-265b0b818810?source=search_post", "author_name": "Jaroslav Hola\u0148", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@jaroslavholan", "publish_date": "2016-09-10", "last_modified_date": "2016-09-10", "readtime": "1.09", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "(10/100) Hodnocen\u00ed j\u00edzdy autobusemJaroslav Hola\u0148FollowSep 10, 2016 \u00b7 2 min readNed\u00e1vno mi Jirka P\u00e9nze\u0161 vypr\u00e1v\u011bl p\u0159\u00edhodu b\u011bhem j\u00edzdy autobusem. \u0158idi\u010d pr\u00fd prudce zabrzdil a\u017e tak, \u017ee p\u00e1r lid\u00ed upadlo na zem.

But this doesn\u2019t mean tearing it apart with your hands or slicing it up with a pair of scissors (though this does work well enough if you find yourself without a grinder and really want to smoke some sativa joints).To put it simply, grinders can make or break your smoking sessions. A grinder with plastic teeth might not perform as well and mash your weed instead of producing a fine and even consistency.

Which means my thoughts have oscillated between deciding it\u2019s just an arbitrary number and cataloguing the achievements I hoped to accomplish by now. Should I see it as a major turning point at which life begins, or a sad realisation that I can no longer aspire to be listed as a \u2018top 30 under 30\u2019 or \u2018top 40 under 40\u2019 in anything? And that\u2019s not helped by by dreaming subconscious apparently reliving my teenage and student years through the lens of John Hughes in the sleeping adventures I can remember when I wake up.But there are positives I can focus on. If I had to pick a time when my life began, it would be when my son was born \u2014 rather than an arbitrary round number of years since my mother began years of hard work to support alongside my dad. My business adventures are not the most wildly successful in history, but they continue, and they\u2019ve helped others achieve impressive success with contributions both large and small. I haven\u2019t managed my childhood dream of creating an amazing novel or screenplay. But I did appear for a few seconds in a British film with featured names you might actually recognise, and have got to know some very talented writers who have inspired me to improve my fiction. And having played a small part in getting some geeks to meet up at a local pub, it\u2019s now a thriving monthly gathering and an annual STEM festival attracting hundreds of children and their families.Most of all my son is growing from a very cute child (I\u2019m biased, I know), into a very intelligent, sociable and confident young man.And I\u2019ve got a growing awareness of the things I can control and work on, and what I need to accept and adapt to. I can\u2019t control the events of life, only how I react and deal with them. And that has meant building up my persistance and determination even as I\u2019ve encountered the loss of family members or friends.That includes celebrating the smaller victories. To write a novel, or build a business, means maintaining momentum over a long period by gaining fuel from the small accomplishments each day. Enjoying each step on the journey, whether it\u2019s completing a page, finishing a task, or even managing client communication and billing.A shared pre-40 celebration with 4 of my oldest friends earlier this yearOne of those things that I\u2019ve been tracking and celebrating to keep up my enthusiasm has been my switch from smoking to vaping. And I can take some pride in the fact that not only have my ex and her partner also switched \u2014 meaning my son no longer has any smokers in his immediate family circle, but I\u2019ve even had a few people contact me via Facebook etc to say they\u2019ve been following what I\u2019ve been doing and it\u2019s helped or inspired them to either quit smoking, quit any nicotine delivery, or to share it with friends they\u2019d like to encourage to stop smoking.With that in mind, here\u2019s the latest progress\u2026.Turning 40 and Reaching 5 Months of Vaping152 days since my last cigarette.2,280 cigarettes not smoked. (Average of 15 per day)\u00a31,140 cigarettes not bought (Average of \u00a310 per pack of Marlboro)Total cost of vaping so far: Kit (inc 2 tanks) \u00a392. Liquids and coils: \u00a3222.48.

Or just over 2 weeks of potential life expectancy.Exercise: I\u2019ve had to take more pauses than I\u2019d like due to some joint/muscle issues. But 107 days of exercise in total still means I\u2019ve managed roughly 3,000 push-ups and squats. And I\u2019m glad to have pushed towards 50 every day to allow me to have the odd recovery period and still achieve an overall 30 per day average\u2026", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Vaper", "Vaping"]}, {"title": "Vape Update: 101 Inhalations", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@badgergravling/vape-update-101-inhalations-a8f2c84c25a1?source=search_post", "author_name": "Dan Thornton", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@badgergravling", "publish_date": "2017-09-26", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-04", "readtime": "2.05", "claps": 3, "voters": 3, "content": "Vape Update: 101 InhalationsDan ThorntonFollowSep 26, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readIt\u2019s now 101 days since my last cigarette. And vaping is being backed as part of the annual Stopober campaign. Along with Public Health England, NHS Scotland has also stated that e-cigarettes are less harmful than tobacco, and around 53% of people quitting smoking last October used them. Despite the fact that some newspapers claimed health advisors were at odds, what the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence actually said is that there\u2019s still little evidence relating to long term ecigarette use, but that advice should be offered on them for people wanting to stop smoking.So basically, there\u2019s still not a huge amount of information on the potential longterm effects of vaping. But all studies into their immediate effects show that they\u2019re much better than smoking. Although obviously it\u2019s safest not to be inhaling anything.Which all means I\u2019m still chuffed to be happily vaping away on 6mg liquid 101 days after starting out with 12mg and no more Marlboro.My Aspire Zelos (right) and Eleaf iStick 40W (left), both fitted with Aspire Nautilus 2 tanksSo what are my latest totals?Around 1,515 cigarettes not smoked.And \u00a3757.50 cigarettes not bought.Total cost of vaping kit: Kit (inc 2 tanks) \u00a392. Liquids and coils: \u00a3162.48. Total: \u00a3254.48.Savings now at \u00a3503.02At 10 minutes per cigarette, I\u2019ve regained 252.50 hours. Or 10.5 days.And continuing with a little over 40 push-ups and squats to mean I can take an occasional rest day and still average out on target \u2014 1,602 push-ups and 1,602 squats in 55 days.So far, the only times I\u2019ve had any issues have been learning to make sure the chimney of the e-cigarette coil is dried out with a bit of tissue if there\u2019s too much liquid in it. And the occasional taste of burning when coils are due to be replaced \u2014 I think I\u2019ve now replaced each tank twice in over 3 months. Trying a \u2018premium\u2019 liquid which I didn\u2019t enjoy did result in burning through the coil a little more quickly, but even so, another pack of coils for \u00a310 or so should last me until after Christmas.Being healthier and essentially giving myself a \u00a32,000 payrise for minimum hassle seems to have worked out pretty well!Looking at prices, it\u2019s getting cheaper and cheaper to try vaping. The Aspire Zelos feels like a marginally better piece of kit, but at under \u00a330 for the Eleaf, you can be up and running for under \u00a350 including a tank. Even if you\u2019re stocked up on duty free cigarettes, it\u2019ll still save you cash fairly quickly.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Ecigarettes", "Vape", "Vaper", "Vaping"]}, {"title": "VR technology impact on information perception:", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@AltairVR/vr-technology-impact-on-information-perception-a3463d591847?source=search_post", "author_name": "Science Cinema VR \u2014 VR Planetarium software", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@AltairVR", "publish_date": "2018-06-29", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-19", "readtime": "3.25", "claps": 4, "voters": 2, "content": "VR technology impact on information perception:Science Cinema VR \u2014 VR Planetarium softwareFollowJun 29, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readrecent research dataThere are varying views on how the virtual reality technology influences on the human\u2019s perception of the world. VR for an average user is a chance to transfer into the entirely different environment and receive the brand new sensory experiences. Before this very technology used to be associated only with the entertainment industry. But in 2018 people teach, build, cure, train and even develop with the help of VR. Therefore, its nature is still under the discussion. We\u2019ve decided to make our own small research to find out the right answers and to ruin the stereotypes related to virtual reality and its impact on the information perception.Let\u2019s start with the figuring out what the \u201ceffect of immersion\u201d is and how it works. The initial intention of VR technology creators was to illuminate the border between a human and a computer. It is aimed at the stimulation of feelings which in its turn form the real experience. The effect of immersion appears when a user leaves the real world completely and feels his presence in the virtual space.The stormy interest to VR has emerged in the early 1990s when the first success has been achieved in the industry of entertainment. In the early 21st century the technology has improved and started to be used in the various spheres of people\u2019s lives. The health care workers and the army were the first who recognized the high potential of using VR for teaching purposes. It let them create a cheaper and safer medium for imitating the learning environment which would be able to improve some of the skills and to teach how to use the gained knowledge in practice. This is one of the reasons why most studies in the foreign psychology are focused on exploring the virtual environment and the so-called \u201cpedagogical agents\u201d, the virtual characters whose aim is to increase the effectiveness of training based on VR.Steffi Domagk, the German professor from the University of Erfurt, admits that the pedagogical agents contribute to heightening motivation for learning. It is related not only to some school or university programs. Also, the virtual reality technology is rapidly developing as simulations which are aimed at decreasing the quantity and the quality of mistakes during training in some risk industries such as surgery, nuclear physics, engineering, and many others. Domagk also explains that enhancing motivation can be achieved only if the agents communicate with students a lot or give the encouraging feedback. The other group of scientists, R. Moreno, Martin Reislein, G. Ozogul, has examined the non-verbal level. According to their research, the pedagogical agents have a positive impact on learning only when they use gestures extensively, for instance, they may point the objects in space or when the arrow is directed on the necessary area. Thus, the pedagogical agents support the cognitive processes and the accuracy of students, motivate them to keep working on exercises.Photo credit: https://uploadvr.com/teomirn-mixed-reality-app-teaches-play-piano/The group of Swiss scientists led by Y. Metrailler did the unusual experiment to understand the abilities of virtual training. The students were doing their practice in the virtual environment. They were formulating the theories, modeling the experiments and analyzing the results in the virtual laboratory. The experiment proved that the virtual environment has contributed to improving their specific and common knowledge in science.The researchers described above demonstrate that the virtual reality is a perfect solution for enhancing the motivation of users. But how it works? The explanation was found by Williams D., Yee N., Caplan S. They\u2019ve discovered that involvement in VR is connected with the real emotional affection of users to virtual characters. It is based on a complicated connection of the personal characteristics and their motivation. This very motivation was analyzed by scientists from a position of three groups of motives: the social, progressive and immersive ones. The social motives are characterized by a desire to start communication with other people and to find new friends. The progressive ones are aimed at self-development and achieving the new levels in the virtual environment. The immersive motives are about learning new staff and opening the new horizons.According to the report, these very three groups make users spend time in virtual reality. The stronger impact of these motives is, the more powerful their desire to achieve it in real life is. Since people can\u2019t make it real sometimes, the users look the alternative variants. The virtual environment then starts to have a direct influence on psychological and intellectual sides of the personality.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Virtual Reality", "Vreducation", "Vrperception", "Vrplanetarium"]}, {"title": "Vipers Head Coach Joseph Blair Leading Young Team To Success", "post_link": "https://2ways10days.com/vipers-head-coach-joseph-blair-leading-young-team-to-success-9057e26775ad?source=search_post", "author_name": "Adam Johnson", "author_link": "https://2ways10days.com/@AdamJ_NBAGL", "publish_date": "2019-01-25", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-25", "readtime": "5.24", "claps": 14, "voters": 5, "content": "Vipers Head Coach Joseph Blair Leading Young Team To SuccessAdam JohnsonFollowJan 25 \u00b7 6 min readIf you\u2019re watching an RGV Vipers game, whether in their new arena or from your home, you might not even hear their head coach patrolling the sidelines. The towering, yet stoic Joseph Blair lets his players actions speak for themselves on the court.You won\u2019t see him cause a stir against the officials, you won\u2019t see him foaming at the mouth over calls that might not go his teams way (that\u2019s an exaggeration, nobody is literally foaming at the mouth\u2026yet). He is unlike most coaches in the G League, and Blair\u2019s style could be considered unconventional to say the least.Cooler than a glass of sweet tea on a hot summer\u2019s day, Blair must be doing something right as his young team (that includes six rookies), is 19\u201310 including 10\u20131 over the last month.A former Arizona Wildcat, Blair has now made his way to leading a team of Vipers. And while both mascots are either deadly or dangerous animals, the smooth talking Blair offers the right approach from the sideline, and it\u2019s seemingly working.\u201cIt\u2019s been a great experience for sure, it\u2019s something I love. When you\u2019re the captain of the ship it\u2019s a different experience but I love what I do,\u201d Blair told 2 Ways & 10 Days of his first season on the job thus far.What\u2019s been working for a team full of young rookies? Working the glass. Despite their desire to push the tempo, the Vipers are second in the league in offensive rebounds per game (14.7), and make the second-most three-pointers as well (14.0, but at a 34.2% rate).Life\u2019s not perfect in the Rio Grande however, they average the most turnovers in the league at 20.6, but they still manage to have the fourth best record in the league.The Vipers historically are also known as one of the fastest paced teams in the league. The first two months they hovered in the middle of the pack (12th fastest in November, 15th fastest in December). They have certainly turned a corner however as they have the fifth fastest pace in the league for games played so far in January. The challenge has been developing rookies to play at a much faster pace this season when they are accustomed to their college coaches allowing them to create on their own.\u201cI know it\u2019s called the G League now but it\u2019s still a developmental league and our job is to develop them to where we want them to be and it\u2019s a process and I understand that and I\u2019m fine with it,\u201d Blair said. \u201cIt has been a challenge to get them to understand how to play but I think the good thing is I don\u2019t want to start great and finish bad so if it\u2019s a progression where we need to get to where we need to be this season then I\u2019m happy.\u201dAs the team heads down the home stretch, Blair has already had four players earn call-ups in his first year at the helm (Danuel House, Brandon Sampson, Gary Payton II, Bruno Caboclo).Cabcolo was one of the brighter spots this season for the Vipers. Having been heralded infamously on draft night over four years ago as being two years away from being two years away, as well as being anointed the Brazilian Kevin Durant, he found a place at home with the Vipers and relished the opportunity prior to his call-up this week to the Memphis Grizzlies.In 28 games with RGV, Caboclo averaged career-highs in points (16.4), field goal percentage (51.6), and blocks (3.0!) per game. He did all this while playing just 28 minutes per contest as well with a +/- rating of 7.2 along with a net rating of 11.9 for the team.\u201cI can tell you from summer league and training camp to now he\u2019s just more comfortable,\u201d Blair said prior to Caboclo\u2019s call-up this week. \u201cHe\u2019s a different guy. He jokes more. He just seems like he\u2019s much more comfortable. I\u2019d like to think that\u2019s a difference that we\u2019ve made with him this year.\u201dThe Vipers could see a fifth player called-up this season as Michael Frazier has also shined and filled in the necessary gaps with this year\u2019s departures. Last year the Northern Arizona Suns had five players called-up.No stranger to the G League, Frazier played previously for the then LA D-Fenders and Iowa Energy for the 2015\u201316 season, averaging rather pedestrian numbers in just 16 minutes per game. Over the last four games those numbers have jumped as he\u2019s averaging over 22.5 points per game in that span and helped carve out a four-game win streak for RGV.Now with a few more years of professional basketball under his belt, Frazier has returned and done well for this team, averaging just over 14 points per game while shooting 42% from the field and 36.6% from 3-point range.The 6-foot-10 gentle giant is also a self-professed vegan, and lights up at the chance to share his favorite recipe.\u201cMy favorite vegan recipe that I make all the time is chickpea ceviche,\u201d Blair smiled in excitement, describing each detail of the dish as if it was set before him. \u201cI love it. Instead of shrimp I use some chickpeas, some red onions, jalapenos, cilantro, lime juice, cucumber, just mix it all up with some spices on top and it\u2019s literally my favorite thing in the world.\u201dA vegetarian for 10 years before becoming fully vegan, Blair shared a message of compassion as his main reason for the change aside from the obvious health reasons.\u201cConsciously speaking I truly feel that there\u2019s nothing that should ever have to die for me to live. And if you\u2019re killing something for you to live when you know you could survive without it you\u2019re killing for greed,\u201d Blair said.But before he was named Vipers head coach, Blair spent three seasons on the bench as an assistant to Matt Brase, who is now a member of the Houston Rockets\u2019 coaching staff. That experience alone prepared him for this opportunity, much when the staff was comprised of himself and Brase specifically last season.\u201cThere was so much collaboration that was involved last year. There was nothing I didn\u2019t expect because I was a part of so much of everything that was happening last year,\u201d Blair said when asked of surprises on the job. \u201cIf I had to pick one thing just the level of communication you have to constantly have with the players to keep them at ease and know what\u2019s expected of them and also just alleviate any tension when it comes with the team.\u201dThe relationship between Brase and Blair began back during Blair\u2019s collegiate days where he played for Brase\u2019s grandfather, Lute Olson, at Arizona. When he was not trying to stuff Brase into lockers or throw him into trash cans (all according to Blair), a special bond grew between both of them.\u201cI love Matt. To see his growth I couldn\u2019t be more proud of an individual to see from what he was to what he is and what he\u2019s learned and how much I\u2019ve learned from him and just his maturation and his growth as a man off the court,\u201d Blair said.\u201cNow what I\u2019ve seen from him on the court is a guy that loves the game, studies the game, and just wants to be the best,\u201d he continued. \u201cHis competitive nature as a coach and his dedication to the game is in my opinion unrivaled. I\u2019m just honored to have coached alongside him and consider him a very close friend.\u201dBlair is making the most of this first-year opportunity with the Vipers, and while the team has seen its fair share of roster turnover (for the right reasons), the question is will they be able to sustain this success throughout the remainder of the season?", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Viper", "Houston Rockets", "Joseph Blair", "Arizona", "Bruno Caboclo"]}, {"title": "UX Camp Europe: Ako to vyzer\u00e1, ke\u010f sa stretne 500 najlep\u0161\u00edch UX dizajn\u00e9rov!", "post_link": "https://medium.com/popcorn-digit%C3%A1lna-porcia-online-noviniek/ux-camp-europe-ako-to-vyzer%C3%A1-ke%C4%8F-sa-stretne-500-najlep%C5%A1%C3%ADch-ux-dizajn%C3%A9rov-8989176e6149?source=search_post", "author_name": "CORE4", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@CORE4", "publish_date": "2016-08-05", "last_modified_date": "2017-05-25", "readtime": "4.98", "claps": 5, "voters": 5, "content": "UX Camp Europe: Ako to vyzer\u00e1, ke\u010f sa stretne 500 najlep\u0161\u00edch UX dizajn\u00e9rov!CORE4FollowAug 5, 2016 \u00b7 5 min readPripravte sa, toto bude dlh\u0161\u00ed \u010dl\u00e1nok.

BarCampy, ako u\u017e n\u00e1zov prezr\u00e1dza, vznikli na baroch, v kaviar\u0148ach a in\u00fdch priestoroch, kde je jednoduch\u00e9 stretn\u00fa\u0165 sa a cel\u00fd de\u0148 spolu keca\u0165 o technol\u00f3gi\u00e1ch, marketingu, dizajne, \u010di akejko\u013evek inej t\u00e9me. Akur\u00e1t tento Berl\u00ednsky/Eur\u00f3psky Camp trochu prer\u00e1stol bar a svojich takmer 500 \u00fa\u010dastn\u00edkov u\u017e tradi\u010dne v\u00edta na univerzite (Schrodinger centrum). Zjednodu\u0161ene: Ide o komunitn\u00fd event od UX-\u00e1kov pre UX-\u00e1kov, pri\u010dom sme v\u0161etci \u00fa\u010dastn\u00edci, nielen div\u00e1ci.Are\u00e1l Schrodiger centra bol kr\u00e1sny industri\u00e1lny komplex s mno\u017estvom predn\u00e1\u0161kov\u00fdch miestnost\u00ed ale aj s priestorom na le\u0148o\u0161enie a diskutovanie s eur\u00f3pskymi UX-\u00e1kmi pri k\u00e1vi\u010dke alebo Club Mat\u00e9.Vy: Tak\u017ee ste sa museli aj vy akt\u00edvne zap\u00e1ja\u0165?My: \u00c1no, museli. Predov\u0161etk\u00fdm preto, \u017ee sme sa prihl\u00e1sili ako dobrovo\u013en\u00edci u\u017e vopred. BarCamp je toti\u017e \u00faplne zadarmo, \u010do je na \u0148om t\u00e1 najlep\u0161ia, ale mo\u017eno aj najhor\u0161ia vec, lebo l\u00edstky sa min\u00fa v priebehu p\u00e1r min\u00fat. Tak\u00e9to prihl\u00e1senie vopred v praxi znamen\u00e1, \u017ee mus\u00edte z cel\u00e9ho v\u00edkendu venova\u0165 jednu hodinku a organiza\u010dne pom\u00e1ha\u0165 na evente. Potom u\u017e beh\u00e1te po predn\u00e1\u0161kach ako ostatn\u00ed \u00fa\u010dastn\u00edci. Navy\u0161e sa spozn\u00e1te aj s organiz\u00e1tormi. Win \u2014 win situation.Vy: Nie je v tom v praxizm\u00e4tok? Bez hlavn\u00fdch re\u010dn\u00edkov, hviezd, keynotes a podobne?My: Jasn\u00e9, \u017ee nie! :) BarCamp tvoria predsa odborn\u00edci na organiz\u00e1ciu inform\u00e1ci\u00ed a vytv\u00e1ranie z\u00e1\u017eitkov. Program sa vytv\u00e1ra v\u017edy r\u00e1no. Ka\u017ed\u00fd, kto by chcel prispie\u0165 do programu, povie pred plnou aulou t\u00e9mu svojej predn\u00e1\u0161ky \u010di workshopu.

Do polhodiny je hotovo.Takto vyzerala polovica programu na sobotu. Ako vid\u00edte, t\u00e9my boli naozaj pestr\u00e9 a vybra\u0165 si len po jednej predn\u00e1\u0161ke bola v\u00fdzva. Preto sme sa rad\u0161ej rozdelili, aby sme ich stihli \u010do najviac.Vy: Sp\u00e4tne by ste vybrali nejak\u00e9ho Key speakra? \u010co v\u00e1m to profesne prinieslo?My: Kone\u010dne sa dost\u00e1vame k podstate! Predn\u00e1\u0161ok sme nav\u0161t\u00edvili asi 20, ke\u010f\u017ee sme sa na ne rozdelili.

Although there are still a lot of \u201cnon-believers\u201d and skeptics of Bitcoin (some referring to it as the modern day Ponzi scheme), I can assure you that Bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology, Blockchain, is not going anywhere soon. Blockchain has the power to revolutionize a wide range of industries such as Healthcare, Insurance, Banking, Stock Markets etc. However this is not what inspired me to write this article.I want to touch on the topic of cryptocurrency trading, specifically Altcoins. This is something that I have really started to enjoy and a few of us created a Telegram group called The Crypto Aquarium. On this platform we basically live and breathe crypto; from discussing the next buy, when to HODL, getting set up, to sharing of great articles. Our aquarium has grown to over 185 crypto fish in just 8 weeks, consisting of crypto investors, miners, developers and entrepreneurs. After being a part of this community and involved in this market, it has made me realize a few key things that anyone with experience in the traditional stock markets should remember when trading crypto. On Monday June 26th, the crypto exchanges were a bloodbath, to the point where I lost 40\u201350% on some Altcoins. Even though most recovered a week later, the cycle repeated itself and on July 10th, we experienced June 26th all over again. The crypto markets\u2019 volatility is truly remarkable and almost experiences a boom and recession on a weekly basis. One of my friends perfectly summed it up, \u201ca week in crypto is like a year on the stock exchange\u201d. This brings me to the key points I want to highlight:Emotional Trading \u2014 If you thought that emotional trading existed in traditional stock markets, guess again. The typical crypto trader differs significantly from your traditional stock trader. A good % of the population does not trade in these decentralized digital assets because they understand its value, but more out of fear of missing out (the FOMO is real) and have little or no traditional stock trading experience. Thus any news (good or bad), results in exaggerated market movements, which drives someone like me, who has been trading stocks for several years, absolutely crazy at times. Some of the more experienced crypto traders, use this to their advantage and takes the term \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d to a whole new level.Blind leading the blind \u2014 I cannot help but shake my head in some instances where the \u201ccrypto specialists\u201d, who made serious profits from trading cryptocurrency by getting in early, now all of a sudden act as investment advisors to all the FOMO players that just started. Don\u2019t get me wrong, these \u201cspecialists\u201d should be admired for believing and investing in something everyone laughed at a few years ago, but to give investment advice with no finance background is very dangerous. Does this mean that someone with no finance background can\u2019t be an exceptional trader? Not at all! While some of these \u201cspecialists\u201d are genuinely great crypto traders and truly understand the dynamics of these coins better than most, others might have to take a step back and ask themselves \u201cmaybe I was just lucky?\u201d. I\u2019ve heard of multiple cases where people invested all their savings into some of these coins and instead of holding their positions during massive sell-offs, realize their loss by selling. Bare in mind, the \u201ccrypto specialist\u201d who tweeted what to invest in is definitely not to blame for that person\u2019s loss, however do you see how vicious this circle can get? One must not forget that the first step in wealth management is to determine a client\u2019s risk and return objectives, while strictly considering their constraints and combining that with a client\u2019s emotional biases, before investing in anything. The suitability of an asset class and it\u2019s allocation % to one person doesn\u2019t necessarily apply to another.Valuation of crypto assets \u2014 the fundamental analysis techniques used for stocks do not necessarily apply in the valuation of crypto coins. A company\u2019s performance, discounted cash flows etc. is not a measure of the coin\u2019s value. Two big factors driving a coin\u2019s value are the utility and scarcity of the coin. This makes it difficult to determine a coin\u2019s intrinsic value compared to traditional stocks. There are great articles out there explaining this more in depth and I would recommend doing some reading before investing in crypto, as you might be a victim of a \u201cpump and dump\u201d trade and lose half of your value in a matter of minutes.In summary \u2014 we are living in very exciting times, some of these coins, if they succeed, will change the world as we know it and in most cases, for the better. Crypto is a completely new asset class and we are still trying to figure out how we should look at it in combination with other traditional investments. In the meantime, happy trading and remember the 3 key factors to maximizing your profit is to diversify, diversify and most importantly\u2026.. diversify! Don\u2019t invest money that you are not willing to lose as your coin might just not be there tomorrow.

Achieve the best streaming experience with VyprVPN.This documentation shows the step-by-step installation of VyprVPN server on AWS (Amazon Web Services).For the VyprVPN own documentation one can follow the this link.Before getting started, first register for an account on VyprVPN .Choose any plan you want (they provide three day free trail), and confirm your e-mail,once done with account creation go to AWS website and log-in in your AWS account.1.Go to EC2 in services section. 2.Click Launch Instance and follow the below steps. 3.Choose Ubuntu server 16.04 LTS in step 1 for choosing AMI.4.Choose t2.micro as it is in free tier.(you can opt for others also.)5.In step 3 of configure instance option go to advance option and under option of \u201cUser Input\u201d copy and paste the content of this page.6.Configure your security group as given bellow:-Type Protocol (auto-set) Port Range SourceHTTP TCP 80 My IP (will detect and select your IP)HTTPS TCP 443 My IP SSH TCP 22 My IPCustom TCP Rule TCP 222 My IPCustom UDP Rule UDP 443 AnywhereCustom UDP Rule UDP 500 AnywhereCustom UDP Rule UDP 1194 AnywhereCustom UDP Rule UDP1701 AnywhereCustom UDP Rule UDP 4500 AnywhereCustom UDP Rule UDP15001\u201320000 AnywhereCustom UDP Rule UDP25001\u201330000 Anywhere7.Finally launch the instance by either creating or using previous key-pair.8.Copy your public IP address and open it in browser ,you will see the VyprVPN installation screen.9.After the Vyprvpn Server Installation is completed ,enter the public ip py amazon in browser and log-in with the below credentials :-Username: adminPassword: Grod42decKThese are the defaults credentials and need to be changed for security purpose.As it would be your first time logging to this server ,accept the exception and continue.After successful login ,go to \u201cSystem Settings\u201d and change the current password.As of now your server is installed and running set your server name and change the IP type which best suits your instance configuration.If you are using elastic IP attached with your AWS instance or if you are using Digital Ocean droplet then set this value to be Static.As in both the cases if the server reboots the server\u2019s IP would not be changed.If you are not using Elastic IP address with your instance then select Dynamic IP in field of \u201cIP Type\u201d.To connect to the server first install the VyprVPN client ,in the following example we will check the server functioning on Android Device.First install the VyprVPN on your android device.Open the App and log-in with the new credentials if you have changed.The application will show your current location. Check your current public IP address (search in google or click on this https://ifconfig.co link to check your current public IP address) .Now connect to your sever by selecting the server name (her we have vyprvpn) .After you are connected a tiny notification will show you that your device is connected to VPN.After you connect to the server , again check your public IP if it changed or not.The new IP is changed from India location to US as the instance hosting the VPN server is in the US location.ConclusionThe VyprVPN server is a good option in market to choose for securing your space in public domain.This server installation provides you the benefit of securing the event driven on the server machine itself as the hosting server is maintained by you ,you can choose to delete the instance anytime eliminating the risk of your logs being read by someone other in case you are afraid of it.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["AWS", "Vyprvpn Incl", "VPN", "Security"]}, {"title": "Zastrel\u00edm prv\u00fdch 45 \u010c\u00ed\u0148anov.

A single module like \u201eEdit Profile\u201d can be responsible for fetching user, displaying some basic information, editing user functionalities and uploading a profile photo. There is a lot of approaches to combine all of it into a single module, and I would like to show you mine, which I\u2019ve used recently.I assume that you are familiar with VIPER\u2019s basics. If you are not, please check some tutorials about it first.Example:Let\u2019s start from basics. At the beginning we will prepare all module items including protocols and classes.I skipped the entire module setup intentionally because I would like to focus on functionalities. At this point let\u2019s assume that we\u2019ve got all dependencies setup up correctly. Now it\u2019s time to start adding functionalities. The first thing which we\u2019ll take care of is getting a user from UserSessionManager. In the production app it would look like quite different, but to simplify the example let\u2019s make it like that:Now we need to combine all of those parts together. The whole task is really simple. Basically, we can just put dependencies and functionalities directly into our module. Unfortunately, that approach would be problematic later on \u2014 we won\u2019t be able to reuse those parts of code in different modules. We can move it to base classes but that solution has another limitation \u2014 we can inherit only from a single class, so that won\u2019t let us easily combine a few different functionalities into a single module. To resolve that problem, I will put functionalities inside additional protocols. Using protocol\u2019s extensions, we can put default implementations of all methods there.To include those functionalities into our \u201eEdit Profile\u201d module we just need to update our protocols. Looking at protocols we can easily get to know what kind of functionalities specific module has.At this point there is only one thing we need to add to our classes \u2014 it\u2019s user data manager. In our example, it\u2019s just regular data manager, but we need to set it to fulfill protocol conformance.Basically, that\u2019s all we need to do. Now we can use all functionalities (currently only user information) from EditPresenter just like below.As you can see we\u2019ve got all functionalities correlated to a user outside Edit Profile module which is a convenience regarding testing and reusing it in different modules. To expand specific module with the additional functionality, we just need to update our protocols, set require dependency, and we\u2019re ready to go.Similarly, we can prepare protocols responsible for editing user (please notice that we are using DataManagerUserInterface written previously since we need the same user session manager here). Just like before, it\u2019s really easy to expand our module with that functionality. The only thing we need to do is to add another base protocols and extensions.Expanding our module with that new functionality is exactly the same like before:TestabilityWe can easily test those functionalities since it\u2019s not put directly in a specific module. Let\u2019s try to write some unit tests for InteractorUserInterface. We can use regular UserSessionManager, but in our example, we\u2019ll use stub version of it.Before we use it, we need to have stub version of data manager which will use that session manager:Now we can create interactor which conforms to InteractorUserInterface but it uses stub version of UserSessionManager.ConclusionThanks to this approach, my VIPER modules are really tiny \u2014 they contain only logic specific for a single module. All shared functionalities I\u2019ve got inside protocols which let me combine them really easily. It\u2019s also really, convenient because of reusability. I do not need to copy the same parts of code in different places. Last but not least: testability \u2014 since those protocols are not strictly correlated to a specific module, it\u2019s really easy to cover it using unit tests just like in the example above. At this tutorial, I presented you how to expand interactors and data managers with new features but using that approach you can easily add additional functionalities for the rest module items like presenter and view interface as well.I\u2019ve prepared playground, which contains a whole example, including unit tests.

Singh Just Here!Book Synopsis : Enter New York Times bestselling author Nalini Singh?s breathtakingly passionate Guild Hunter world with the story of a woman who isn?t a vampire or an angel?or human?Once a broken girl known as Sorrow, Holly Chang now prowls the shadowy gray underground of the city for the angels. But it?s not her winged allies who make her a wanted woman?it?s the unknown power coursing through her veins. Brutalized by an insane archangel, she was left with the bloodlust of a vampire, the ability to mesmerize her prey, and a poisonous bite. Now, someone has put a bounty on her head? Venom is one of the Seven, Archangel Raphael?s private guard, and he?s as infuriating as he is seductive. A centuries-old vampire, his fangs dispense a poison deadlier than Holly?s. But even if Venom can protect Holly from those hunting her, he might not be able to save himself?because the strange, violent power inside Holly is awakening?

"Advance Viper Architecture for iOS without Retain Cycles.Akshat SharmaFollowApr 16 \u00b7 4 min readThese days developers of big team give a lot of time in using and maintaining their code base with an Architecture which provides all the primes essentials of development cycle. As a developer it is very important to design our code so that each piece is easily identifiable, has specific and obvious purpose, and fits together with other pieces in a logical fashion.In this article, I will introduce an approach to how to exactly use VIPER architecture in our iOS projects without falling under heaps and heaps of memory. This article is not a beginner for VIPER architecture but for those who have used it and might have struggled in identifying few memory issues.Before continuing, kindly clone the project on GitHub.In this project, there are two view controllers which will very easily and clearly demonstrate the main issue. Home View Controller is the root view controller of the main navigation controller and account view controller pushed onto the Home VC.After cloning the above mentioned repository, checkout \u201cWithout_VIPER\u201d branch.This branch shows the prime objective of this demo project. Two screens on one navigation stack. On pressing the Account button, Account VC gets pushed to the navigation controller. On the console you\u2019ll see that both view controllers are loaded into memory. Once you press the back button on navigation bar, you\u2019ll see that the account view controller has been de-initialized.So, this is the base ground of our project. After popping the view controller, it should get de-initialized and memory should be freed.Now checkout \u201cBasic_VIPER\u201d branch of the same repository.Now both the view controllers are following the VIPER architecture methodology in the following way.After running the application, you\u2019ll see that on Home VC all the communications are being done. It is just simulating the basic flow of VIPER architecture. On pressing the account button, Account VC will be pushed to navigation controller and a whole new chunk of objects will be added into memory. Now on pressing the back button, you\u2019ll see that Account VC has not been de-initialized from memory.Each time you press the account button on Home VC, you\u2019ll keep adding bulk of objects into memory which will be holding reference to each other and will be retained.In a project like this with only two view controllers, if this memory management is not handled in a proper full fledged project, your application might be holding on to numerous dandling pointers.Our task is to remove the above retain cycles.Now checkout \u201cAdvance_VIPER\u201d branch of the same repository.Our prime focus is on removing the above mentioned retain cycles from our project. There can be many ways to do the same, but I\u2019ll be following the described approach.I\u2019ll be holding a weak reference of our V (View Controller) from our P (Presenter) and similarly will hold a weak reference of our P (Presenter) from our I (Interactor).Presenter implementation will be in following way.When Account Presenter is de-initialized, we make our reference of interactor nil and as presenter \u2014 interactor reference is weak, there won\u2019t be any retain cycle left. And Similarly for View and Presenter retain cycle will be handled.Once you run the project and pop the Account VC, you\u2019ll see that all the objects are now de-initialized from memory and memory is freed.This article does not suggest the proper way of implementing VIPER architecture, it just shows that while implementing VIPER, iOS developers should take care of retain cycles in whichever way they find it easy. If these retain cycles are not handled, your application will suffer with memory issues, so better get on removing the same.If you find any other more fascinating way to achieve the same, kindly share.Happy Coding!", "responses": 1, "tags": ["iOS", "Viper", "Swift", "Viper Architecture", "Retain Cycle"]}, {"title": "Catholic Bishops\u2014Morons or Vipers?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@beautifulbuddha/catholic-bishops-morons-or-vipers-33361e5be98?source=search_post", "author_name": "Bethany Beeler (the Beautiful Buddha)", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@beautifulbuddha", "publish_date": "2018-08-30", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-30", "readtime": "3.03", "claps": 50, "voters": 1, "content": "Catholic Bishops\u2014Morons or Vipers?Bethany Beeler (the Beautiful Buddha)FollowAug 30, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readA) Yeah, morons.B) Definitely Trouser-Snake Vipers.C) A little of (A), a little of (B) \u2026How about none of the above?Let\u2019s weigh the evidence. In this episode of Catholic Hierarchy Follies \u2026Archbishop Aquila doing his best to make anyone but himself accountable.Exhibit 1\u2014Cardinal Sergio Obeso Rivera (retired Archbishop of Xalapa, Mexico) says that the victims of pedophilia who \u201caccuse men of the Church should [be careful] because they have long tails that are easily stepped on.\u201d This bozo was recently made a Cardinal (probably because of his PR expertise).

King of Viper Assholes.Not only do they not think they just stepped in dogshit but they righteously proclaim that the aroma of it is the updrafts of the heights in which they ride on eagle\u2019s wings.Choice (A)\u2014Morons?Sure, we can easily see that these guys are stultifyingly stupid, living in whited sepulchres, lacking any and all PR savvy. But the sheer malevolence of these statements belies the well-intentioned-buffoon label. Nope. There\u2019s malice here.Choice (B)\u2014Vipers?The easier (and more satisfying) answer choice (B) lets us vent our moral outrage.

There\u2019s something systemic here.Choice (C)\u2014Both?True, you don\u2019t get this kind of self-inflicted stupidity without a whole lot of evil. Answer (C) allows us to feel witty and outraged without ever asking the visible-from-an-orbiting-satellite question: \u201cHow are these assholes \u2018Princes of the Church?\u2019 \u201dAll three answers let us posture without ever doing a goddamn thing about the goddamned systemic evil that is the hierarchy of the Catholic Church.Systemic evil is never dislodged without civil disobedience and great sacrifice. It\u2019s time to rise from our comfy pews to challenge the institution we\u2019ve so taken for granted that we miss the hideous evils done in our name, in our faith, in our trust.Dogshit and Eagle\u2019s WingsIt\u2019s so easy to say that the clown-bishops listed above just \u201cstepped in it.\u201d But here\u2019s the thing: Not only do they not think they just stepped in dogshit but they righteously proclaim that the aroma of it is the updrafts of the heights in which they ride on eagle\u2019s wings.And it\u2019s not just these pieces of dogshit who feel justified in making such hideous statements (and in harboring predators). It\u2019s every damn bishop in the hierarchy, including Popes Francis, Benedict, JPII, and Paul who were authored by and who continue to author this broken, malevolent, dysfunctional, drooling narrative.Put the Keys of Peter in the hands of the true treasures of the Church \u2014 the poor, the broken, the prostitutes, the tax collectors, and say that you are not worthy to unstring their sandals.Nothing Will Change \u2026 UnlessNot a goddamned thing will change about that narrative unless we write the next 666+ chapters to break this antichrist\u2019s back.

Although Albert Einstein\u2019s Theory of Special Relativity did not forbid anything to travel faster than light but it is practically impossible due to the fact that a particle with mass needs infinite energy to be able to travel faster than light: the closer to the speed of light a particle is moving the more energy is needed, which is translated to more mass needed to provide energy. Chances are better when both light and the moving particle are in a vacuum. In other words, travelling faster than light can only happen at times when gravity and time dilation is involved.Light has been the ultimate tool that we use to measure everything: from travelling within time to observing events, and to manipulation of an object by the force of gravity. It is with light that everything existed and happened. In the Bible, the word that God used to start our universe is \u2018Let there be Light\u2019. Our universe started when there is a big bang which is only observable and existed when there is a release of light and projection into the furthest distance which finally settling down into the planets and the stars as we know today.Have you ever wonder why is it in human\u2019s nature to be evil or human being has higher tendencies to do bad things rather than being good? The nature of existence even before the beginning of the universe is darkness, nothingness and evil. Evil may also be a word that is made up just to describe an absence of good.But what if \u2018good\u2019 is something created by God?God created the universe, the light and the living things to counter the omnipresent darkness and evil. Happiness and everything that is good, are created for a better reality and existence. The knowledge that God wanted to keep from Adam and Eve is that the very nature of everything is evil and full of darkness, and God created the light and the universe so that human being can enjoy the creation that is good. Unfortunately, human being human is attracted to their nature and they wanted to have the knowledge. But once they received it, their eyes are opened only to see that the reality is not that rosy.That should explain the saying, \u2018Everything that is good comes from God\u2019.To give an analogy, heat will travel from somewhere with higher temperature to somewhere colder which is lower in temperature. Heat is like the good thing that God has made, but it will always travel towards the colder side, the nothingness, the absence of heat. This is one of the scientific manifestations that the omnipresent condition is the opposite of what God has created- the prevalence of nothingness and wickedness.Everyone that has strong faith in religion or the atheist who is very understanding of the concept of being human, knows that human being is a very flawed being. We have more tendencies to do bad things or sinful action. If we look at these behaviours, it seems that it is in our nature to be doing bad things, as if we are more attracted to go that way.This is almost similar to the tendency of heat to go from a place with high temperature to a place with lower temperature. This is naturally the way heat transfer works. A civilised people would have gone to school or religious classes to know what is right and wrong: to know what is expected of the society and the religion, to live a life that contributed to the greater good, to lead a life that ensures good things to happen to you in the future through efforts and hard work.In other words, we were conditioned in order to behave in a way that is acceptable to society and that could earn us respect and rewards.Coming back to the heat, in order for heat to not leave a certain point, it has to be contained with insulation. But one way or another, some of the heat would found ways to leave the insulated part to go to a colder place. For us human being, we will always make mistakes and do things that are deemed wrong in the eyes of religion and God.Why is this happening? Why, do people keep doing bad things or have more tendencies to lead a sinful life? What can we do to stop the naturally occurring rot? The creation of goodness and light are the first Divine Interventions in the history of creation. This the reality and knowledge that God wanted to keep Adam and Eve from because the truth is that evil are all around and we human being will be easily attempted to go towards evil and sinful life. God created goodness because wickedness and darkness should not be the only thing that exists, and there should be light at the end of the tunnel: the goodness that can be created and experienced; How the evil could be wrong and that light and holiness can prevail and triumph over the omnipresent evil.When one is describing life, they will associate it with light. When there is light, there is life. This is basically a simple concept that people use to find other life in outer space. The picture capturing of other galaxies and nebulas are made possible thanks to the presence of light.The interesting part is even though knowing that most of the light from the stars that reached the Earth are light years away and probably we are seeing events that happened millions of years ago- people still find it necessary and worthy to find life and planets that can inhabit life.Where there is light there is life. A very simple concept.To simply explain why one associates light with life is because both life and light are an entity with energy, moreover, it is visible energy. By energy, it means effort and work done. It is not like darkness where without energy and work done, darkness is still and always there.The light itself is special, with the light we got to see colours. Colours give more ingredients to the life itself. Even though for colour blind, they still can distinguish colours such as black, white and grey- it gives variations to our life.Human beings are made up of people of different types of skin. Some are darker, some are fairer, some having more genes from the father, some have more skin complexion like their mother. Same goes to animals: some people chose their pets based on the animal\u2019s colour, such as red fishes and white birds. Some birds like peacock are using colour to show off their pride and something that they possessed to be boastful for.We are also using colours to distinguish things, such as soccer teams, a company\u2019s associated colour. If you are a special artist like Prince, you will be associated with the colour purple. We also associate the colour red as something passionate, or fiery, while some other colours such as green is to be related with something peaceful and relaxing. These colour itself are having their own wavelength that can have an impact on how human beings feel and think when perceiving them.Lights are the things that can be used to measure the passing times. Day and night, brightness and darkness are the way we use to basically realising and counting how many days have passed.There is an effort to calculate time across the history of humanity on Earth, one of the ways is by using hourglass by letting sand flowing from one cylindrical bulb into another bulb. In other words, we can call it time, but in this case, it is a visual representation of the duration of an observable event. Some other ways are by using the sun as a time measurement.For example Sundial, a triangle shaped blade placed on a circular flat plate. The movement of the sun will cast a shadow on the plate and represent the time of the day. Another one is Obelisk, an erection of a tower where the sun can hit on it and replacing shadow on the tower. The later the day, the brighter it gets and the shadow gets lower, and vice versa as it is getting into night time.The next one is Merkhet, ancient way to check time passing in a longer range, it is observing the location of the stars in the sky by putting Orion, the north star as the point of reference and how far the other stars moved away from it after weeks or months.It is interesting to see that with light, a visual tool can be used to measure time and calculate the duration of a certain period. To put it simply, with light, it will show you the way and that everything happens at the correct timing to the best of the situation.Light is interesting due to its ability to show us objects and surroundings in multiple dimensions. For example, with a dot (1st dimension) and with the collection of dots we got to see images or pixels of pictures. With the 2nd dimension, we got to see things in x and y direction (length and height), like the moving pictures that we see on the TV and cinemas.In the year 2000 (The age of millennial) we are more familiar with the technology of 3D, where we got to see the object at a better representation, as we got to see the object for its height, length and width. There are more depths to the visual thing that we can see. We make use of light and shadows to better represent the objects and the corners and curves that the object possessed.Coming into the 4th dimension, where time is in the picture, we can still use light to see how time is passing by taking the advantage of the brightness of the light and the darkness of the shadow. We can only know time is passing if we can see and the clocks and the timer that we have, regardless whether it is analogue or digital we still make use of visual representation to see the passings of time.Going to the 5th dimension, the highest level known and perceivable by a human with the assistance of light is the presence of gravity. The easiest way to know gravity exists is by observing the blackholes, where all the light bend and the bending disrupt the space and time and the disruption spread across the universe which is being captured in 2016 in the form of a gravitational wave by LIGO.There are more dimensions in the universe, but with the current limited knowledge and perceive-ability of human, we could only see up till the 5th dimension. Above it, it can only be felt and might be slightly out of the subject that is being discussed now which is light.Excerpted with permission from \u2018The Science of Faith\u2019, where the concept of faith and God is explained via existing famous scientific theories and knowledge.Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Vyner Mano.

The Montreal Canadiens, the Habs, Les Habitants, are a team on the brink of taking a turn downward. After years of some overall success, primarily on the backs of a strong defensive core and the best goalie in the world (Carey Price), they\u2019ve enjoyed tasting the postseason and even the Eastern Conference Finals a few times. But now, in 2017\u201318, there\u2019s a chance that they may not even make the playoffs.But before rabid Montreal fans start ripping me a new asshole for saying all of this, please, just hear me out.Is a guy like Paul Byron going to score 22 goals again? Or will he more likely return to form as a 8\u201312 goal man. His shooting percentage was a ridiculous 22.9% last season. That would just be impossible to replicate.Will the loss of Alex Radulov be overcome by Jonathan Drouin? Drouin was protected in Tampa Bay by superstar talent like Steven Stamkos and Nikita Kutcherov. In Montreal, he will be the #1 center, even though he has never played that position in his professional career (yes, I\u2019m aware that he played some center in Juniors). But clearly, it will be a different kind of challenge at the NHL level.Will Alex Galchenyuk ever find out what position he\u2019s going to play? Wing, center, wing, press box? His coaches in past have never quite trusted him and Claude Julien, though a fantastic coach, is restrained by his GM Marc Bergevin, who primarily plays to the fans and to the media. So Alex will seemingly continue to be stuck in limbo.NHL.comHow about new addition Karl Alzner ? Is he going to live up to his freshly-inked massive contract (a five-year deal worth $4.625 million per season)? God knows Habs\u2019 fans do love overpaid players who don\u2019t live up to their pay check. Personally, I think he\u2019s a bit too slow to keep up with the league now and he\u2019s probably paid about $1.5 Million too much. Not to mention the fact that he\u2019s going to have to fill the shoes of a Canadiens near-lifer in Andre Markov.Shea Weber. Does he still have the leg speed to maintain himself as a premier defenseman in today\u2019s version of the NHL. The league is getting faster and more agile. Just like Karl Alzner, the question remains\u2026 is he going to be quick enough to keep up with the young guys? There\u2019s no question that he\u2019s still one of the Top 15 defenders in the league, but his stock is slowly dwindling.And finally, the biggest question of all: Can Carey Price stay healthy for the whole season again. It seems that every second season, he succumbs to a major injury and misses significant time. As a hockey FAN, I have my fingers crossed that this doesn\u2019t happen, because the NHL is simply a better caliber league with him playing in it.Overall, the Habs should still make the playoffs this season, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they didn\u2019t, all the same. I for one, actually want to see them in the postseason.

Team Canada was being led by a budding NHL prospect by the name of John Tavares. His poise, speed and skill was on display in volumes, every single night. He brought me up out of my seat multiple times, including his hat-trick against the rival United States team. Overall, he exploded in the tournament for 15 points in only 6 games and was easily handed the Tournament\u2019s Most Valuable Player trophy.Some months later, at the NHL Draft, he was selected 1st overall by the New York Islanders. He went on to have a solid rookie campaign, totaling 54 points over a complete season of 82 games. The next two seasons, he followed up with 67 and 81 points respectively. After the lockout of 2012, in the shortened season of 47 games, he actually topped the point-a-game measure, with 48 points. To this day (including last season) his career totals in the NHL are 537 points in only 587 games (0.92 points per game). If those aren\u2019t \u201csuperstar\u201d numbers, I don\u2019t know what are.Tavares was named Captain of the Islanders in 2013, deservedly. He has led them in every statistical category since his entry into the league. He has also led what has been, in very recent history, been a rather poor hockey team into the playoffs a few times. It\u2019s obvious to see that he\u2019s led the franchise by example, \u201cdriving the bus\u201d so to say.NHL.com / Cory WrightPreviously, the organization\u2019s struggling ownership could have caused him to re-think his status on The Island, or to re-evaluate what\u2019s been a perennially poor supporting cast. But in 2017\u201318, things may just be taking a turn for the better for the young man, starting with the addition of former World Juniors teammate Jordan Eberle this offseason. With an influx of young talent like Josh Ho-Sang and Mat Barzal, this team may in fact be fighting for a playoff spot down the stretch run.When it comes to the media, John certainly isn\u2019t the most spoken about athlete\u2026 until this year, when he\u2019ll draw plenty of attention with his contract running out in New York. Speculation will likely attempt to link him to Toronto, being he is from Mississauga and grew up a Maple Leafs fan. However, for cap reasons, that scenario is highly unlikely. Another market that would love to have his skills would be Montreal. But my sense is that Tavares does not want to play in a large market. He seems to enjoy his anonymity somewhat. I think he will either stay on Long Island, the lesser demanding market of the two \u201cNew York\u201d teams, or move to a Western Conference team like San Jose or Anaheim, where he can continue to put up numbers and slip under the radar of hockey media.Tavares is definitely one of my favorite players to watch. His skills, shot and hockey sense make him an elite player in the NHL. I only wish his star shone brightly enough for more fans to take notice of him. I, for one, will always route for John Tavares (except of course when he plays my favorite team and his hometown team, the Maple Leafs) to succeed in the NHL. Only time, and his continued skill, will tell if that rings true.See you on the ice!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Sports", "NHL", "Hockey", "2017 Nhl Preview", "John Tavares"]}, {"title": "Implementing VIPER Architecture Pattern for iOS", "post_link": "https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/implementing-viper-archticture-pattern-for-ios-d24a6def8ba2?source=search_post", "author_name": "Mahdi Chtioui", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@mahdichtioui", "publish_date": "2019-09-02", "last_modified_date": "2019-09-02", "readtime": "6.56", "claps": 767, "voters": 53, "content": "Implementing VIPER Architecture Pattern for iOSUnderstanding VIPER architecture\u2019s logic and learn how to implement it in your app.Mahdi ChtiouiFollowSep 2 \u00b7 7 min readWe use architectures in software development to organize our code into different layers, in order to make it cleaner, easier to test, to maintain and to write less boilerplate code.As developers, we need to be familiar with different architectures, because sometimes we have to work on codes that are written by different developers that use different architectures. The least is that we have to know, is the principles of different architectures and how to implement them.Normally when developing mobile apps, we use the most famous and popular architecture that is suggested by Apple, which is our beloved MVC.MVC is not a bad architecture (there\u2019s no such thing called bad architecture, we just have to choose the architecture that works best with our needs). It\u2019s just when our app is a little bit large we will face a problem called \u201cMassive ViewController\u201d. As developers call it: Our ViewController will be responsible for almost everything (showing data, retrieving data from services, updating the UI, navigating to other ViewControllers \u2026), basically, all our business logic will be implemented there. At this point using the MVP architecture will be a good idea since our View will be responsible only for updating the UI and all of our business logic will be moved to the presenter. The MVP architecture will solve our problem, but if the app keeps on growing. So is the presenter, and each time, there are a couple of new modules implemented into the app. The presenter then will contain a lot of code which will make it difficult to manage, harder to test and to maintain. And that\u2019s where the VIPER architecture comes in.If you ever want to develop Scalable applications, then VIPER architecture is the best choice for that matter.What are the benefits of using VIPER?VIPER offers a lot of benefits if used in the right way and for the right project:Well suited for large and complex projects that grow over time by adding new features (Scalable Projects): Allow us to keep the project maintainable for the long term.Simple and easy to understand code by other developers of the team. Makes identifying bugs and errors easy, since each layer has its own responsibility (Single Responsibility Principle): depending on the error, we can know which layer is responsible for that error.Modular and well-organized project.Adding or removing features is easy.Reduce the load on controllers, which makes them light-weight.UI logic is separated from Business logic.Makes it easy to test and maintain the code.Composition of the project is based on use cases.Let\u2019s start by introducing VIPER architectureVIPER architecture it\u2019s basically an implementation of a clean architecture for iOS applications, which is based on the Single Responsibility Principle: \u201cDo one thing and do it well\u201d.Clean architecture divides the logic of our app into distinct layers. Each layer has its own responsibility.Here\u2019s an interesting post about Single Responsibility Principle.VIPER will make our app modular. Each module will be composed of 5 layers that define the VIPER architecture (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity and Router). Each layer has a distinct role or responsibility in the module.Before we dive deep into VIPER\u2019s layers and flow let\u2019s start by having a clear vision about the implementation of this architecture.The easiest way to picture an implementation of VIPER architecture is to put into mind that our ViewController will be structured into different elements. Meaning instead of having a ViewController, we\u2019ll be having a View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Router. As easy as that.The best thing about VIPER is that it allows us to structure each module of our app into VIPER architecture. Each module will contain View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Router, which makes the app cleaner, easier to test thanks to the separation of concerns it provides. Besides we don\u2019t have to worry anymore about having a Massive ViewController or presenter (less boilerplate code).To wrap up, our application will be composed of different modules. Each module has VIPER architecture implemented in it (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity and Router).Different layers of VIPER architectureLet\u2019s start by taking a look at each layer and understand its responsibility.ViewThe view layer, which is basically the UIViewController and any other view type. This layer contains the UI logic (display, update, animate\u2026) and responsible for intercepting the user\u2019s action and send it to the presenter. Most importantly, it has no business logic.InteractorWe can think of it as \u201cThe Network Manager\u201d: responsible for retrieving data from the services (Network, database, sensors\u2026) when requested by the presenter. The interactor is responsible for managing data from the model layer (note that Model is not part of the VIPER architecture, feel free to implement it or not, but for sure it will make our app more concise).PresenterI like to think of it as the motherboard, it connects all layers together. The presenter is the only layer that communicates with the view (The rest of layers communicates with the presenter). Basically, it\u2019s the layer responsible for making decisions based on the user\u2019s actions sent by The View.EntityEntities are simply our models that are used by the interactor. It\u2019s best to put them outside of the VIPER modules at least, in my point of view, since these entities are usually shared in the entire system by the different modules.RouterSomeone calls it \u201cWireframe\u201d. This layer is responsible for handling navigation logic: Pushing, Popping, Presenting UIViewControllers.VIPER\u2019s Flow and the relations between these layersNow let\u2019s see how these layers communicate between each other and the flow it follows.VIPER Architecture PatternThe view sends all the user interactions to the presenter to handle them and make the necessary UI changes. Depending on the interaction, the presenter may need some help from the interactor if it needs to retrieve data either remotely or locally or to perform some business logic using the entity. It also needs the help of the router in order to make any navigations to the other ViewControllers.Take VIPER architecture to A WHOLE NEW LEVELI think it\u2019s better to use a Model layer between the interactor and the entity. This Model layer is responsible for retrieving data when the interactor asks for it. It contains the entity and the managers of Remote and/or Local Database. These 2 managers are responsible for retrieving data using entities and send it to the Interactor when requested.Our Interactor will act as the Data Manager, asks the managers (remote and local) for data when the presenter request these data. This solution will make our interactor light-weight and easier to write and understand.But as I said earlier, it\u2019s best to put the Model layer outside of the VIPER modules, since it\u2019s used by the entire system with its different modules.VIPER Architecture + ModelImplementing Example of VIPER architectureTo better understand this architecture, I prepared this demo example using VIPER. This demo example will show how to implement this architecture using Protocols for communication between its layers.The demo is just a simple Posts app used from a dummy API online called \u201cJSONPlaceholder\u201d and here\u2019s the link.It\u2019s simply an app that has 2 modules: one for listing posts in a UITableView from the dummy API and the other for viewing post details.We will be using VIPER and a Model as explained in the previous section. Let\u2019s get started.Setup the Project Files and classesThere actually, a lot of Xcode templates out there that will do this for us (generate the files and folders). But for now, let\u2019s do this manually since we\u2019re still new to VIPER.Project Composition (Xcode)Model: contains our entities and servicesServices: contains the class responsible for consuming the dummy API.Modules: contains our modules: PostsListModule & PostDetailsModule.Each Module: contains 4 folders (not 5, Remember that we placed Entity into Model): View, Presenter, Interactor, protocol, and Router.Protocol: contains our protocols used to build communication between the layers.The others are already explained earlier.Build Our Model (Entity and Services)Let\u2019s start by our Entity, we will use the Object Mapper library for building the entity class \u201cPost.swift\u201d.Post.swiftimport Foundationimport ObjectMapper struct Post : Mappable {    var userId : Int?    var id : Int?    var title : String?    var body : String?     init?(map: Map) {   }        mutating func mapping(map: Map) {         userId <- map[\"userId\"]      id <- map[\"id\"]        title <- map[\"title\"]        body <- map[\"body\"]   }}Now let\u2019s move to our PostService class which will be responsible for retrieving the list of posts from the API and mapped using our entity.PostService.swiftBuild the PostsListModuleNow that our model is ready, let\u2019s start by building our PostsListModule.PostsListProtocols.swiftPostsListInteractor.swiftPostsListRouter.swiftPostsListPresenter.swiftPostsListView.swiftI published the demo source code to GitHub.Wrap upVIPER is an architecture pattern that is based on the Single Responsibility Principle.

What is VIPER Module ? How should a module be assembled?The BackstoryRecently, as iOS development team we have decided to migrate our project codebase from Objective-C to Swift, also we have discussed the use of a new architecture instead of keeping all stuff in MVC.So, open XCode, select file and new project, choose swift as development language and start over again, right ? \ud83e\udd14Nope, sometimes things are not so that easy. In fact, product managers would not be happy if whole team left new upcoming features as well as sprint goals to work on migration process. Therefore, we had to do both swift migration and common sprint jobs in parallel to make everyone happy. Apple call it Mix and Match, details can be viewed from link below,Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C (Swift 4.1): Swift and Objective-C in the Same ProjectDescribes various aspects of Swift's compatibility with the Objective-C language and Cocoa/Cocoa Touch frameworks.developer.apple.comHowever this story is not about swift migration, also there are much better articles about it. If we focus on our decision about changing app architecture, what was the reason behind this ?Actually iOS project we have been working on was like a giant spaghetti in a pot that every developer add her/his own sauce to recipe for each new task.So, which features should a good architecture provide?Easily followable data flow.Each object has a clear role separated from others.Easy to test.Truth is, our iOS project is lack of these features clearly.Well, what are signs indicating there is a problem with app architecture ?Massive view controllers with thousands of lines of code.Getting lost while debugging.Increasing number of global variables all along the app.Nearly impossible to test.Not surprisingly, these signs were defining our project. So, we have started to search for different architecture patterns used in iOS, with considering their pros and cons. After lots of reading, we have set a meeting to discuss with each other and make a final decision. At the end of the meeting, everyone seems to be satisfied with an architecture named VIPER to be our next.What is VIPER ?Viper is an architecture that divides a feature implementation into five distinct layer in one module. Each character of VIPER represents a different layer;V: ViewI: InteractorP: PresenterE: EntityR: RouterEach layer has a distinct role in the module. In VIPER, I think implementing a feature like building a lego from different parts. Let\u2019s take a look at each layer,ViewView is a dummy object receiving touch events most of the time. Instead of MVC\u2019s massive view controller with thousands lines of codes, basically all service related codes and decision makings should not exist in it. For example, when a touch event was received from the user, view object should notify the presenter like \u201cMy dear presenter, a touch was received from user and I don\u2019t know what I should do with it\u201dPresenterI think presenter is the heart of the VIPER module. Only layer in the module that communicates with all other layers. Basically all decision makings should be handled in the presenter. After the decision, presenter has to communicate with the layer required. For example, after notified by view with touch event, presenter should decide what should be done next. Does screen need to update it\u2019s UI ? Then tell view layer to update UI with given info. Should a data be fetch from remove server ? Then tell interactor to fetch it. Similarly, does app need to navigate to other screen ? Then tell router to navigate which screen it is.InteractorInteractor contains business logic and it\u2019s mostly responsible from api calls. It builds request from parameters and creates objects by mapping response. After finishing service connection, it notifies presenter like \u201cHey presenter, these are puppies you are looking for\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I am not able to fetch your needs at this moment\u201d. You get the idea.RouterYou need segue to another module ? Tell router which module it should be presented next and leave the rest to it. Router needs a UINavigationController instance to do such navigation stuff. Also I think that router should be responsible for showing alerts since UIAlertController is used with present method.EntityPlain data objects mainly driven by interactor. No more, no less.To summarize, what a VIPER module should look like, take a look at the figure below;Figure 1: Basic Viper Module DiagramMeet the Best iOS Demo App EverLet\u2019s convert something implemented in MVC to a viper module step by step. I created a very basic iOS app that consists of 3 screens which are Home, AddressList and AddressDetail. Home and AddressDetail are just dummy screens to provide integrity all around the app.For example, let\u2019s reimplement address list screen with VIPER. (Unit tests are skipped for now to make implementation short). Address list view controller simply presents addresses and if user clicks one of the addresses or add new address on the navigation bar, page navigates to address detail screen.Before start, take a look at the AddressViewControllerAs you can see, making service calls, presenting popups, triggering segues etc all are handled in view controller. It may seem not a problem in this case, however believe me view controller will be getting bigger and bigger in the real world scenario in a similar situation. So, let\u2019s implement it with VIPER.Viper Module ImplementationFirst thing first, we should create layers, like;AddressListView, aka AddressListViewControllerAddressListPresenterAddressListInteractorAddressListRouterAddress as EntityOf course all these layers should move under the folder AddressListModule.Initial AddressList Module Folder StructureLayer InterfacesTo make responsibilities clearer, each layer should apply a protocol to open themselves to other layers, from now on I will call it interface. For example, what does presenter want AddressListView to do ? Most probably it gives an array of address properties which are listed in the screen. Also grouping protocol methods with a comment according to who will use them would be better.Before jump to implementation directly, let\u2019s define interfaces of layers;AddressListView InterfaceAddressListPresenter InterfaceAddressListRouter InterfaceAddressListInteractor InterfaceHow did we write all these ? Answer is simple, thinking about responsibilities of each layer. Just be sure that each layer applies it\u2019s own interface after defining them \ud83d\ude43After interfaces are done, define associated layer variables in each layer considering which layer it should communicate with. You may want to look at the Figure 1 at this moment.Next we should think how we can create the module. Since different modules communicate between their routers, I think router should assemble the whole module. Since it is independent from module\u2019s actual router instance, we can create a static module creation method in AddressListRouter;Module Creation Static MethodAlthough static module creation method in router is just fine for me, I\u2019d like to hear if you have a better idea.Now, we can implement interface methods. Let\u2019s check the AddressListViewController again after implementing methods;AddressListView ImplementationNow you can see that view has no idea what is going on. Each time a user touch event is happened, lifecycle method is called, view tells what happened to presenter instead of doing something itself. Even it does not contain any data related with addresses, it just asks to presenter what will be displayed in the cells while reloading table view. So let\u2019s look at the presenter then;AddressListPresenter ImplementationAs you can see that presenter determines what will happen next and invokes responsible layer. If fetching data is required, it tells to interactor, if the view should be updated, it makes it via view\u2019s interface methods. Similarly, if a navigation stuff is required, it commands router to do it. However no UIKit related operation is allowed here. Also, when view is needed to address data, presenter gives only a part of the necessary properties will be displayed in the screen, it handled with giving tuple to view in the demo project.Let\u2019s look at the interactor;AddressListInteractor ImplementationInteractor is just responsible from service calls in this module. It fetches address list using it\u2019s service property whenever presenter requested. Also if an error occurs, interactor notifies the presenter with associated error message. Although there is no analytics event sending or fetching local data in this module, interactor is responsible from them. At last, router implementation can be seen below;AddressListRouter ImplementationWhenever you present, pop or push something, you should know that it is router\u2019s job. As you can see above, router provides that navigate another view controller, as well as presenting something includes popups. Again, since it is a demo project there is only one module in it, router should communicate with other modules in a real project in terms of navigation.What about other stuff used in the module except layers ?We have used custom cell named AddressListTableViewCell in the view layer to present address data. Also AddressListResponse and Address models are used by interactor layer. Since these files are associated with AddressList module, we should move these files under the module\u2019s folder in the project navigator;AddressList Module Folder StructureFinal WordsAt the end of the story, we created an Viper module step by step. Although implementation of VIPER seems more work needed in first step, adding new capabilities to the layers is really easy thanks to the protocol oriented approach. Following data flow in the debugging is easy too, since each layer has a clear role. In addition to it, even view controller can be testable by using presenter when each life cycle method invoked and each user action happened.However, it would be an overkill for the relatively small projects.One last thing, if you are afraid number of layers that you should create for viper module, you may want to give a chance to script below, which is created by my teammate \ud83d\ude0cCIVIPERGeneratorHappy coding !", "responses": 4, "tags": ["iOS", "Viper", "Swift", "Protocol Oriented", "Mobile Architecture"]}, {"title": "Clean Architecture For iOS Development Using The VIPER Pattern", "post_link": "https://medium.com/slalom-engineering/clean-architecture-for-ios-development-using-the-viper-pattern-fac30f5d29fc?source=search_post", "author_name": "Edward Groberski", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@egroberski", "publish_date": "2018-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-01", "readtime": "6.31", "claps": 182, "voters": 46, "content": "Clean Architecture For iOS Development Using The VIPER PatternEdward GroberskiFollowMay 22, 2018 \u00b7 7 min readPhoto by Zachary Young on UnsplashWhen starting an iOS project, among the first obstacles developers will focus on besides the purpose of the application or what Cocoapods they\u2019ll need will be how they will organize code, and maybe which design patterns will be followed. While most developers will stick to the tried and true MVC (Model-View-Controller) or MVVM (Model-View-View Model), there is a clever pattern called VIPER that many do not know about. VIPER may change the way you\u2019re used to developing for the iOS platform, and like most things, it has positives and negatives.The Usual SuspectWhen first starting with iOS development, developers will hear a lot about MVC or Model-View-Controller. This Apple approved architectural pattern appears everywhere including Apple\u2019s UIKit, most tutorial example apps, and a majority of the apps on the App Store today. Just like the name suggests, MVC is broken down into three responsibilities:Model: The application\u2019s data and logic that manipulates that data.View: The User Interface that the user manipulates.Controller: Controls the logic between the Model and the View.MVC will work just fine if you\u2019re working on your first app or working in a small team, but as the app grows, developers begin to jokingly refer to MVC as \u201cMassive-View-Controller.\u201d As time goes on more and more logic gets shoved into the Controller, and the Controller becomes more bloated and untestable. This is what the VIPER pattern tries to solve.What is VIPER?The VIPER pattern is a Clean Architecture that conforms to the Single Responsibility Principle. VIPER strives to divide the app\u2019s logic into distinct layers of responsibility. Going a couple steps further than MVC, VIPER is broken down into five responsibilities:View: Displays information from the Presenter and sends user interactions back to the Presenter.Interactor: Retrieves Entities and contains the business logic for a particular use case. They are view agnostic and can be consumed by one or many Presenters.Presenter: Handles preparing content for the display and intercepting user interactions.Entity: Simple data model objects.Router: Handles navigation logic for which screens should appear and when.When implementing VIPER, each feature or module will follow the above structure. Since the app\u2019s logic will be separated into smaller components, the views now become lighter and the logic now becomes more testable.The Flow of VIPERThe basic flow of VIPER is fairly straightforward. The user is brought to a new View by the Router, the View notifies the Presenter that it needs data, the Presenter asks the Interactor for data, the Interactor retrieves the Entities (from network request or local database), the Interactor sends the Entities to the Presenter, the Presenter creates View Models from the Entities, the Presenter sends the View Models to the View, and the View displays the necessary data to the user.Implementing VIPERTo demonstrate creating a module in the VIPER pattern, let\u2019s pretend we are creating an app that displays a table of cars. Each cell displays the car\u2019s make and model. The user will have the ability to tap on a cell and see the details of the car, or they can click on a \u201cCreate new car\u201d button to add a new car to the list. When implementing a new module, I find it easier to work bottom-up, so we will start with defining our Entities.EntitySince the app is dealing with cars, let\u2019s create a simple struct object that will hold some basic information: the car object.The car object is what our API service will return to us. It contains basic information like id, make, model, and trim of the car. However, when we want to display information about cars, we do not need to include all of their information since the table cells only need to display the make and model of the car. So, we can create a quick view model to represent just the make and the model of the car.This quick view model will be created in the Presenter and passed back to the View.InteractorNow that our Entities are established, let\u2019s create our business logic or \u201cuse cases\u201d for them. Our table view will need to be populated with cars from an API service. So we will create an Interactor that handles retrieving cars from the API and sending them to the Presenter.To do this, we declare a protocol method called getCars that will use our API service to get the cars and return them. Since our app is pretty simple, we do not need additional use cases (although most real applications have several use cases).PresenterWith the Interactor in place, we now have a way to retrieve cars that we will eventually display. As stated earlier, the Presenter is in charge of reacting to a user\u2019s input and preparing content for the display. Our app\u2019s description mentioned the need to display cars (make and model), the ability to show a car\u2019s details, and the ability to create and add a new car to the table. Next, we will create a Presenter that allows us to do just that.For our ability to show cars, we have added a showCars method that uses our previously created Interactor to retrieve the cars and then create simple View Models from those objects that will be used for specific types of cells within the View. The next two methods, showCarDetail and showCreateCarScreen, will use the Router (this will be created next) to navigate the user to the correct screen. These are three methods that our View will use to enable functionality.RouterWhat\u2019s an app without navigation? The next step will be to create a Router that handles navigating a user to different screens depending on the action. So far, our app requires us to navigate to a car detail screen and a create new car screen. Let\u2019s implement those two scenarios now.Our two methods showCarDetail and showCreateCarScreen simply instantiate new View Controllers and use a presenting View Controller\u2019s Navigation Controller to push them onto the view stack.ViewNow that we have a way to retrieve cars for display and several means for navigating the user to different screens, our next step is to create a View Controller that relies on the Presenter to handle its content and actions.The first thing we may notice is our View Controller is now extremely light. There is no logic done in our View Controller, just simply calls to the Presenter which delegates what should happen. No more Massive-View-Controller!Testing With VIPERDue to the VIPER pattern\u2019s distinct layers of responsibility, unit testing can be accomplished very easily. Each level can be tested individually without the need to set up complex environments. To demonstrate this, we can test our CarPresenter. This Presenter handles loading car data, showing the car detail screen, and showing the create new car screen. Let\u2019s create some tests.Since we created our Router and Interactor methods with Protocols, we can easily mock those classes for testing purposes. The CarPresenter is then created using those test classes, and within the tests we can easily verify that our expected behavior is correct.The Benefits of VIPERIn the seven months that I used the VIPER pattern, I identified some advantages:Ease of testing: Due to the loosely coupled nature of the VIPER pattern, adding unit tests to every object is simple compared to other patterns.Handles large teams: The project that I used VIPER on had roughly 15 developers. Because of the separation of modules within the pattern, developers can easily work on different parts of the app without stepping on each other\u2019s toes. Using VIPER also helps to reduce merge conflicts.Ease of development: Once the project is fully set up on VIPER, it becomes easier to add a new feature to a module. If you need a new way to sort something, you can add a new method in the Presenter. Developers can couple the VIPER pattern with Dependency Injection to add new features quickly and easily.The Negatives of VIPERWhile the VIPER pattern might help eliminate Massive-View-Controllers, it does come at a price.Too much boilerplate code: As you can see in the examples above, a lot of template code needs to be created to create a simple application. This can slow down development in the beginning and add unneeded complexity. The increase of files can also add to the compile time.High learning curve: Due to the increase complexity of VIPER over MVC, the team might need more discussion and training on to properly implement the pattern across their application.Full buy-in: In my experience, the whole project needs to use the VIPER pattern. VIPER does not play nicely with Massive-View-Controllers, partially implemented VIPER modules, third party Cocoapods that do not use VIPER, and even Apple\u2019s own frameworks. When using VIPER with existing code or new frameworks, extra work is required to ensure code compatibility.ConclusionAlthough the world of iOS development is tightly coupled to MVC, the benefits of using the VIPER pattern in iOS development can be transformational for the right kinds of projects and teams. I\u2019d recommend evaluating the VIPER pattern for larger projects and teams who are looking to reduce conflicts, increase test coverage, and separate their code responsibility more cleanly.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["iOS", "Mobile App Development", "Software Architecture", "Design Patterns", "App Development"]}, {"title": "Stakenet 2019 | XSN VIPER, DEX, & MERLIN", "post_link": "https://medium.com/stakenet/blockchain-2019-xsn-viper-dex-merlin-1a2b472ea795?source=search_post", "author_name": "Draper", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@john_draper", "publish_date": "2019-01-02", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-04", "readtime": "4.02", "claps": 1540, "voters": 40, "content": "Stakenet 2019 | XSN VIPER, DEX, & MERLINDraperFollowJan 2 \u00b7 5 min read2018 brought many developments and breakthroughs from our core team of blockchain developers to be proud of. We have been able to make significant breakthroughs in interoperability (achieving new milestones in DEX infrastructure), launch the first POS +MN coin with segwit activated ( executing lightning swaps), first to deliver TPoS (a premiere and first of its kind offline staking solution), launched Stakenet.io cloud staking + masternode setup platform, work alongside industry leaders such as the Litecoin Foundation and much more.Always thinking forward, we make sure to position and engineer the network for success and are proud to present our vision & roadmap for 2019. Here is an overview of the general plan discussing some key milestones to look forward to in the year to come.2019 Stakenet DEX, MERLIN + VIPEROur 2019 roadmap primarily has a focus on two main areas we call MERLIN and VIPER. DEX technologies, cross chain interoperability, and cross chain staking fall into MERLIN. A product line of custom XSN unique blockchain powered-hardware devices will make up VIPER. Below I will cover these 2 phases, how they will connect along with descriptions, goals and key milestones for each. Both phases will be worked on in parallel.MERLINIn the latter half of the year our team was able to make significant progress and breakthroughs in the field of interoperability. After publishing one of the first guides on how to execute cross chain atomic swaps over lightning we successfully organized and executed the first ever public push that guided over 100+ lightning swaps on main-net where everyday users exchanged LTC for XSN on lightning of both respective chains. This was an important step as it proved the infrastructure of our coming DEX + light wallet has baseline stability to further develop and complete our goals. Below we describe the key goals of MERLIN in the 2019 roadmap ahead.Key upcoming milestones MERLINEnable 1 click lightning swaps, allowing users to exchange assets instantly over Lightning with the click of a buttonAchieve frictionless interoperability, notably achieved by our pro trader DEX high volume exchange. Instantly trade assets as they are secured from our open source cold storage EXCALIBUR (HW that maintains, and manages users private keys)TPoS migration to masternode layer, + automated exchanging of assets through MN quorums. (enabling cross chain proof of stake (CCPoS) on the XSN network)Cross Chain DaPP infrastructure on MN networkVIPERWith the amount and variety of chains that exist supporting specialized 2nd/ 3rd layer technologies, support for databases + CPU to run these processes (I.e lightning hubs, masternodes etc) will come at ever increasing costs. This means larger and expensive devices are needed making it difficult to scale. With VIPER we aim to use the Stakenet blockchain itself to solve these problems with custom HW products offloading CPU and DB requirements into the XSN network. This will keep products small, affordable but powerful which will allow us to contribute unique value to the space.This technology of blockchain powered devices we believe will be at the forefront of both IOT and Web 3.0 in the near future. Offloading CPU, dB requirements successfully to a decentralized network alone has the potential to push major paradigm shifts in the general computer hardware/ tech space. As for our network, the resulting effect will be increased vehicles for MN nodes to collect fees (in XSN) for providing these services leading to increased use and demand of the Stakenet coin. Network economics will also strengthen on both first and second layers as added services will increase demand and fees through the entirety of the platform. Below are key milestones of VIPER to look forward to in the forthcoming year.Key upcoming milestones VIPERLaunch of our open source private key management and storage system (EXCALIBUR). Private key management will be audit-able by the public. We will utilize EXCALIBUR in all VIPER products making them safe, secure and trustlessLaunch initial HW versions (XSN VIPER): Early versions of the VIPER will integrate basic LN routing capabilities giving users ability to run LN hubs and generate fees for XSN, BTC and LTCActivate CPU offloading from XSN VIPER to Stakenet blockchainEnable multiple LN Hubs + MN\u2018s to be run on VIPER. Allowing users to safely execute higher level functions of various chains and coins from cold storagePutting a focus on hardware + 2nd layer software will build a strong foundation in building future applications in the areas of security, governance, (blockchain) software as a service, DAPPs, interoperable payment networks and more which we plan to also integrate into our platform and product lines moving forward.Another important point to mention is our 1st later protocol upgrades in the 2019 roadmap as well. We understand heavy disruption (specifically in 1st layer consensus) is coming, and are making sure the platform is positioned to quickly and easily adopt these new technologies when proven stable. Having a reliable and prime procedure for network upgrades big and small will be a constant focus during development (of MERLIN and VIPER), making sure to accommodate any unforeseen disruptive tech that comes.There are of course many other exciting developments in addition to the ones mentioned, keep track of fully detailed descriptions and realtime progress and updates of our roadmap hereJoin our discord to be a part of our community.

Each step is a separate view controller. There\u2019s a single presenter whose user interface is dynamically set to the current view controller.Where and why we use single-module flowsWe use this pattern in the voter verification flow because we don\u2019t have to reuse views outside of the flow. If you don\u2019t need to use existing modules inside your flow then the Single-Module pattern is pretty convenient and practical.How it worksThe wireframe is the orchestrator. It initializes the view controllers and pushes them onto the navigation controller as needed.When a view controller reports that it\u2019s \u201cdone\u201d, it notifies the wireframe. At this point the wireframe pushes the next view controller onto the stack and the process continues until the last step.ProsMinimum overhead and VIPER boilerplate. There\u2019s no need to create an entire module for each step in the flow.Simple and easy to manage. No need to jump around or context switch to different modules.ConsBloated application logic stack. The presenter, interactor, and data manager handle all the business logic for the entire flow so this can start to get heavy depending on the flow.Multi-Module FlowsUnlike the Single-Module pattern, in this pattern the flow is composed of many VIPER modules (one per step). There\u2019s also a coordinator module responsible for orchestrating the flow.Where and why we use multi-module flowsWe use this pattern in the onboarding flow because it requires a little more flexibility from a product standpoint. For example, we had to include our existing inviter into this flow.How it worksThe coordinator wireframe\u2019s job is to initialize everything and manage the steps in the flow. It does this by using a finite state machine.When a step module tells the coordinator \u201cHey, I\u2019m done!\u201d, the coordinator grabs the next module\u2019s view controller and pushes it onto the navigation controller.ProsAbility to inject existing modules into the flow.Single Responsibility Principle / Separation of concerns. The coordinator doesn\u2019t need to know about the details of each step.Managing the step order is easy. There\u2019s only one file to check.ConsAdding new steps is costly. You have to create a new VIPER module for each one.The coordinator wireframe implements a lot of protocols.Linked-List FlowsThis last pattern is the most \u201ccompact\u201d in terms of code. The \u201cflow\u201d here is implicit and is controlled by the modules in the flow directly. When module 1 is done, it just routes onto module 2, etc..Where and why we use linked-list flowsWe use this pattern in the flow where after signing a petition we ask the user to invite others to sign. This flow only had two steps so the Linked-List flow pattern was most applicable.How it worksWhen one module is done, its wireframe initializes and routes to the next module. This routing happens either directly or using a central router (depending on how your app is architected overall).ProsNo need for a coordinator module. The flow is implicitly controlled by each module.ConsModules in the flow have to be dedicated to the flow. If a module needs to work both inside and outside a flow then it must be configurable as such, perhaps via a state flag during initialization, which is probably not the best pattern.Changing the order of the flow can be difficult.Reasoning about the flow is challenging. There is no birds eye view of the steps in the flow. Instead, you have to follow the breadcrumbs from module to module.Final ThoughtsThere is no perfect solution for managing and orchestrating flows with VIPER. While each pattern has its strengths and weaknesses, I prefer the Single-Module flow due to its flexibility. Of course, the type of flow you choose will depend on your feature requirements.In general I find that short and simple flows make for better user experiences, simpler code, and preserved sanity.", "responses": 3, "tags": ["Programming", "iOS"]}, {"title": "VIPER of many faces \u2014 Part 1", "post_link": "https://medium.com/ios-os-x-development/viper-of-many-faces-part-1-d37cb04cfa41?source=search_post", "author_name": "Mladen Despotovic", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@poksi", "publish_date": "2018-08-07", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-30", "readtime": "7.64", "claps": 146, "voters": 24, "content": "VIPER of many faces \u2014 Part 1Mladen DespotovicFollowAug 7, 2018 \u00b7 8 min readCourtesy of iStockPhotoMy favourite is Blue. Such a magnificent creature\u2026.Still, although a great nature enthusiast, with all its creatures, I will not shame myself any further with my weak knowledge of zoology. I will talk about VIPER client architecture, of course.This story is NOT another \u201cIntroduction to VIPER on iOS\u201d or anywhere else at the moment. I believe we have loads of articles covering the topic. It is assumed, that you understand the concept and have some experience with it. It is also not about comparing it with any other architectural approach or architecture. I picked that one because it does represent a relatively good Clean Architecture approach and follows SOLID principles to something bearable. I wouldn\u2019t even use the acronym myself, but I guess it makes easier for all of us to understand the topic.This story is about presenting the VIPER in a more diverse way, showing its friendly face.To do this, I will first deal with the few myths and after that with a few issues, I consider real problems and next time we shall look into a demo project, which would stand there as a possible solution/answer.Myths and IssuesMyth 1: VIPER has a lot of classesDoes it? How many classes do you think it should have? Or better said: how much of Single Responsibility Principle you want to have in your code?Perhaps all this is a bit of debatable. Even with SR principle, we can quickly end up debating about what is the responsibility of one particular class. For example, Microsoft in their definitions of MVVM sees the View Model as a Glue Code, as a middleman between business logic and a view. One could argue, that this responsibility is too broad: handling an event, presentation logic and transform model data into a view-friendly form should be considered as separate responsibilities.Point is: whatever the architecture, if you want to make your code maintainable and reliable, then it will have to conform to the many paradigms of Clean Code and that includes SR, small classes, as little coupling as possible, OO Patterns, full monty\u2026 That all leads to \u201c\u2026a lot of classes..\u201d.Myth 2: Is rigid and has a lot of boilerplate codeI remember years ago, when I started with the VIPER commercially for the first time, taking over an existing project, it wasn\u2019t the best experience. Not because of the VIPER itself, but because of the obvious struggle with the concept.I actually saw, what I named here as a myth:each module required a lot of boilerplate codemany times the classes were empty of created just to \u201cfollow the approach\u201ddevelopers struggled to adopt requirements\u2019 logic to accommodate it into VIPER specs, which of course didn\u2019t work and lead to some weird combination of following it rigidly and breaking it at the same time.. And when I say \u201cbreaking\u201d, I really mean it in terms of breaking the encapsulation of the module for one.Presenters or Routers connecting too many objects bilaterally and making every structural change a real PITA\u2026We shall see later in our demo project, that it doesn\u2019t have to be like that if you do it with this in mind:What you need to follow, are the SOLID and other OOP principles VIPER was based on and according to that, you should create classes you see fit for the job.Implement your boilerplate in your protocol extensions, abstract classes or even superclasses (if not too many!!!) as much as possibleMyth 3: Is hard to learn, fit only for Senior DevsVIPER is as hard to learn as it is to learn SOLID, TDD and OOP Design Patterns. Wait\u2026 but that\u2019s what we do anyway, don\u2019t we?OK, I could add FRP as well. But never mind, you got my point: if you ever wanted to become a real Senior Developer, then you have to learn aforementioned and in that case, you should code VIPER as easy as cutting your pizza and splashing it down with your craft beer of choice.Yeah, but juniors\u2026 Ok, so, if your junior colleagues don\u2019t dance VIPER style, then your codebase adopts to skillsets of juniors? If so, then yes, VIPER is fit only for Senior Devs. However, in most of the places I\u2019ve ever worked at, we made sure juniors were coached by seniors through the code and not the opposite: adopting the code to fit the highest common skillset level\u2026Myth 4: Doesn\u2019t go well with SDK dictated MVC infrastructure, like in iOSI think I debunked that one again in my series Module Oriented Architecture, specifically in Part 6: Outsmarting the MVC. You also have frameworks like Uber RIBs, which tackle the issue as well, but I have to admit I personally think architecture should not be turned into instant framework solution, but that\u2019s beside the point here.Myth 5: Not fit for small projects or prototypesAgain, in series Module Oriented Architecture we could see the VIPER classes totally lean and small, because most of the boilerplate was implemented in protocol extensions.If you follow such approach, described in Myth 2, then you can find it very easy to use and very fast to implement any kind of specific functionality even in small projects and prototypes.Problem 1: Communication between the objects can get convoluted and complicated.This is what I consider a real issue\u2026I already mentioned issues in the first project I worked on. I remember all sorts of combinations of delegates, closures, wiring, globals, all sorts of things you can imagine. Many modules were turned into a mess with loads of memory management issues and subsequently also race conditions.But how did this happen? Were the problems coding skills? Poor understanding of VIPER, SOLID? None of this made sense\u2026I took me quite a long time, to find the culprit and it was hilarious, especially when I started to code according to this discovery to see, how simple and obvious the root cause was\u2026What was it then? The usual suspect: S from SOLID: Single Responsibility Principle!Yes, the modules were simply too big, too comprehensive, doing too many things. Instead of providing the task, service, they provided the feature, many times related directly to a product feature.This caused the following:more responsibilities created more classesmore classes created more dependencies between themmore tasks and their classes required and created more dependencies to classes from other modules, creating even more potential memory issues and making the whole app more coupled and rigid, thus wasting one of the basic gains of VIPER: module encapsulated tasks and featuresmore classes and dependencies, harder to test, harder to catch a potential issue.more tasks, more requirements for business logic classes beyond the usual VIPER 5, which brought even more confusion about how to connect them to othersmore business logic classes, more bi-lateral communication between the classes which increases the risk of creating memory issues, especially when UI navigation with its own memory management is involvedor\u2026.more responsibilities created more functions also in the VIPER 5 classes, breaking SR principle on the class level thus bringing all the known consenquences\u2026The consequences were grim, especially considering how simple and obvious the reason was.Solution?However, as much as simple the reason was, the solution was not that easy. We shall see 3 further short parts:POC Project which will demonstrate a potential diversity of VIPER, deal with some of the myths abovewe shall use the same project to demonstrate how can the Use Case of Clean Architecture be applied on the App layer and orchestrate the app and leaving modules lean and highly reusable. It will be a step further in Application Services, which we already introduced in the Module Architecture.We shall see, how even within a very lean module, links between objects can still be a problem and we shall use the event-based approach to resolve it.Our demo POC ProjectLeaving here a bit of information about our demo project:It\u2019s almost a single view banking app, where we listed some Top Highlights and Last Payments on the first page.Initial pageHighlights can be also extended by tapping any of them, but this will come in handy later when we shall add user analytics. Tapping continuously toggles extended and collapsed the display of the Top Highlights.Expanded Top HighlightsIn the lower part of the screen we show Last Payments and we can also see the details. Selecting the payment navigates to Payment Details:Payment DetailsHere is the schema of the used classes, just for the teaser\u2026We can already see few things, which point to our freedom of choice and rejecting rigidity and one and only VIPER module template:we use View Models as well, because we want to keep our model objects clean, our Interactor to focus more or less on communication with the API and Presenter to serve the views without creating content for themas already mentioned above, Presenters role is only presentational logic, where it responds unilateraly to the View Controller requesting the view model by calling the Interactor getting Model from it and mapping it into the View Model. If there would be more complicated views, then the last task would be most probably offset into a special View Model Factory, which would do the job for Presenter. But since our case is simple enough, we don\u2019t create classes just \u201cfor the sake of the approach\u201dfor the Highlights, we use 2-stage view model, where there is one type for each Highlight and one for all of them to keep the state of expand/collapse away from Presenterwe use embedded Table View Controller for Payments and we use it also as Table View Data Source, we don\u2019t see the need for separate type for thatwe have altogether 3 View Controllers and only one Presenter!!! \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31Aaaaaaaaaggggrrrhhh!!! Touching the Holy Grail of VIPER! Well,\u2026 no. A Presenter is still there, handles presentation logic and to be honest, the second view controller is merely an embedded one with a purposefully integrated with a parent view and a third is a simple detailed view of the data, which was already acquired by a presenter, hence the latter referencing the view modelsPayment Details View Controller doesn\u2019t have any separate view?!?

This assumes that the application supports config file monitoring and reloading the Kubernetes way, which is now* the case with spf13/viper, the popular configuration management library for Golang.But before going into the example, let\u2019s take a brief look at how Kubernetes handles ConfigMap files mounting and updating.ConfigMap updates in podsWhen a ConfigMap changes, the real path to the config files it contains changed, but this is kinda \u201chidden\u201d by 2 levels of symlinks:> oc get podsNAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGEpostgres-5457758cd8-mhl7q   1/1       Running   0          1hwebapp-5c6db95b69-t7tlg     1/1       Running   0          1h> oc rsh webapp-5c6db95b69-t7tlgsh-4.2$ cd /etc/configsh-4.2$ ls -aldrwxrwsrwx. 3 root 1000130000 78 Oct  1 20:30 .drwxr-xr-x. 1 root root       20 Oct  1 19:37 ..drwxr-sr-x. 2 root 1000130000 25 Oct  1 20:30 ..2018_10_01_20_30_03.939924911lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root       18 Oct  1 19:37 config.yaml -> ..data/config.yamllrwxrwxrwx. 1 root 1000130000 31 Oct  1 20:30 ..data -> ..2018_10_01_20_30_03.939924911> more config.yamllog.level: info> exit# update the ConfigMap with a modified `config.yaml` fileand apply the new YAML manifest> oc apply -f templates/webapp-config.yamlconfigmap \"app-config\" configured# return in the container, wait and see the changesoc rsh webapp-5c6db95b69-t7tlgsh-4.2$ cd /etc/configsh-4.2$ ls -aldrwxrwsrwx. 3 root 1000130000 78 Oct  1 20:32 .drwxr-xr-x. 1 root root       20 Oct  1 19:37 ..drwxr-sr-x. 2 root 1000130000 25 Oct  1 20:32 ..2018_10_01_20_32_35.623973186lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root       18 Oct  1 19:37 config.yaml -> ..data/config.yamllrwxrwxrwx. 1 root 1000130000 31 Oct  1 20:32 ..data -> ..2018_10_01_20_32_35.623973186> more config.yamllog.level: debug> exitNote the double indirection: when the config file is updated, it\u2019s the link from ..data to the real directory that is overwritten. In other words, the link from config.yaml to ..data/config.yaml does not change, but that\u2019s the ..data link that switches from one folder to another one.ConfigMap update support with spf13/viperIt\u2019s now time to see how a ConfigMap file can be reloaded in a Golang application using the spf13/viper library*.In the application code, the configuration is built using Viper such as below:In short, when initializing a new Configuration, the log level is first set to info by default (line 14). Next, the ./config.yaml config file is read from the filesystem (line 19) and if it contains an attribute with the log.level key, then this updates the varLogLevel entry in the configuration. Finally, a file watcher is setup (line 29) and each time a change is detected on the filesystem, the logger is set to the new level (line 32).After the ConfigMap update shown in the previous section was applied (i.e., setting the log.level value from info to debug), the application picked up the change as soon as the new version of the /etc/config/config.yaml file was published in the pod:> oc logs -f...time=\"2018-10-01T20:32:35Z\" level=warning msg=\"Config file changed\" file=/etc/config/..2018_10_01_20_32_35.623973186time=\"2018-10-01T20:32:35Z\" level=warning msg=\"setting log level\" level=debugEt voil\u00e0! \ud83c\udf7fNote that, as the official Kubernetes documentation says:When a ConfigMap already being consumed in a volume is updated, projected keys are eventually updated as well. Kubelet is checking whether the mounted ConfigMap is fresh on every periodic sync. However, it is using its local ttl-based cache for getting the current value of the ConfigMap. As a result, the total delay from the moment when the ConfigMap is updated to the moment when new keys are projected to the pod can be as long as kubelet sync period + ttl of ConfigMaps cache in kubelet.\u2026 which explains why it can take a few seconds (or more) until the change becomes effective in the pods.[*] You\u2019ll need a version of spf13/viper that contains the 8e194e commit, which corresponds to the merge of the pull request to support WatchConfig on Kubernetes.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Kubernetes", "Golang"]}, {"title": "Clean architecture for iOS (VIPER/VIP)", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@saad.eloulladi/clean-architecture-for-ios-viper-vip-c19de40b71e2?source=search_post", "author_name": "Saad El Oulladi", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@saad.eloulladi", "publish_date": "2019-04-22", "last_modified_date": "2019-06-17", "readtime": "9.71", "claps": 183, "voters": 20, "content": "Clean architecture for iOS (VIPER/VIP)Saad El OulladiFollowApr 22 \u00b7 10 min readDuring the last years, the mobile software industry has grown at a remarkable rate. Mobile applications were mainly small and contained generally few screens. While now they became gigantic, with a UI and business logic so complex.In addition to testability issues faced with regular MVC architecture. The well known massive view controller problem made people look for an alternative to be able to scale well mobile applications.Then Clean architecture, introduced by Robert C. Martin (a.k.a. Uncle Bob) started gaining interest by the mobile community. Searching for a better separation of concerns, and less coupling in the application codebase.Clean architecture is an abstract concept which is not related to a given technology or language. Taking the special context of the mobile into account, people at first were not sure how to apply it on iOS. So Conrad Stoll came with VIPER in his article \u201cArchitecting iOS Apps with VIPER\u201d. Which was the first architecture on iOS inspired by uncles bob clean architecture.After that, Raymond Law suggested VIP architecture in his blog as an improvement of VIPER, criticised for not being fully aligned with clean architecture principles.What is exactly the benefit of adopting Clean architecture ? what makes VIP different from VIPER ? And is VIP really a an improvement over VIPER ? let\u2019s try to demystify all this step by step.Whats is CleanBefore talking about iOS implementations (VIPER and VIP). Let\u2019s discover first first the Clean Architecture concept itself. And what are the benefits that it brings in a software in general.Clean architecture helps to address the following issues :Code becomes too dependent to frameworks.Whether it\u2019s the UI or database. When you have your code mixed with the framework related part. you are obliged to follow the technical implementation. while with clean architecture , we isolate all frameworks related code in a separate layer.Usually when you have an issue or you want to modify something, it\u2019s hards to find the related code, to you need to pend lot of time searching. While clean architecture provides a good separation of concerns so is much easier to find something in your code.Clean architecture helps to isolate business logic in one layer, instead of having it spread all over the code.When all the application is done as one big module, its parts becomes too coupled to each other. But with clean architecture, the application should be split into multiples modules, which makes creating random dependencies very hard.Due to the separation from frameworks, Unit tests becomes much easier.Clean architecture layersWhenever you read about Clean architecture. You will find the above diagram. each circle represents a layer that should be separated in the course code :Entity : plain objects, representing the enterprise business rules, they can be a structure of data or a set of methods. they are meant to be shared by all the enterprise applications.Use case : Represents the business logic specific to the application, it can make use one or more entities.Interface Adapter : the role of this layer is to transform the data given by the use case, from a raw data structure the most convenient format for the final usage, whether it\u2019s a UI, web or database.Framework layer : This is where the use of data is concretised, Mainly when applied to the mobile context , we are talking about the view.The Dependency RuleAn important rule about this architecture, which is indicated by the arrows pointing inward the circle : Is that every layer, should know nothing about the layer in the top of it.For instance the entities should have no reference of use cases. and so on.Screaming architectureAnother important principle of clean architecture to take into account is the so called \u201cScreaming architecture\u201d.What it means in short is that when you look at an application structure, you should get an idea of what the application actually does, rather than seeing technical details.In other words, the parent application source code folders should be grouped by features. And inside each feature folder, you find the structure related to the technical architecture you are using.Now that we talked about clean architecture in general, let\u2019s have a look at its implementations on iOS.VIPER architectureThe first attempt to apply clean architecture on iOS was VIPER.No it\u2019s not a reference to the venomous snake \ud83d\udc0d. But it stands for (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router).Notice that here we don\u2019t talk about the viewController. this is because it\u2019s considered as a view. And mainly the goal here is to spread the code that used to be in the viewController all over VIPER components :Entity : Simply the data model (mainly structs in Swift).Interactor : This is the equivalent of (Use case) in clean architecture. And this is where the business logic should be. it\u2019s also responsible of getting data, whether rough network calls or database queries.Presenter : This is the central piece of VIPER architecture. The equivalent of Interface Adapter in clean architecture. It does two major tasks : Transforming data (into view models) to be used by the view & to intercept UI actionsView : As we just said above, what we mean by the view here is both view and view controllers. The important rule to keep in mind is to avoid doing business logic on it.Remember \u201cOnly UI code\u201dRouter : is responsible of moving from a screen to another. This makes navigation code testable and easy to find. Hence all routers should have a reference on the current navigationController. This component does not exist in the original clean code principle as defined by Uncle Bob. This is because screens navigation mechanism here is quite specific to the mobile and iOS in particular.Structure of VIPER moduleThe above diagram shows how VIPER components are related to each other. It\u2019s important to put strong and weak references in the right place to avoid having retain cycles.Note that components are linked through interfaces , and each one has a protocol defining it\u2019s behaviour.Note also that only the view and the router should import UIKit, this way we make sure to have no dependency to the UI among the rest of VIPER module.Builders and WorkersThe above structure represents the core logic of VIPER architecture. you might find elsewhere, people using some extra components like Builders or Workers.Builder (Sometimes also called Configurator) : Instead of initialising all VIPER parts inside Appdelegate or a previous Routers. we can use a class called builder to put all init code for a module. usually it has no properties, only a static class that builds viper module around the view (viewController)Worker : For instance, Interactor class is managing data from different sources, let\u2019s say we have a rest API and a local database to use for offline mode. Then we can make a worker class for each data source, this will reduce the size of our Interactor and will allow us to reuse our workers later in if needed.Let\u2019s have some practice.This is a one page app to buy magic candies.The user set the candies quantity. And at the bottom we display the total price and the price including taxes according to the quantity.First we defined a CandyEntity with the base data structure we need.Notice that we are using protocols to define the behaviour of each component, in order to have contracts we can use without needing to know anything else about each other. and in order to b e able to replace easily components.And an api worker simulating a web service call to get data as CandyEntity object.The next layer will be our Interactor. It owns an instance of the APIworker which it will get the data from.The Interactor has two methods :Fetch candy model using our ApiWorker.And another which is called when ever we update the quantity.And all your business logic is happening in the Interactor, since it\u2019s here where we calculate the actual price, and we pass it with all the other informations including the Tax to the presenter.Here in Presenter layer we have two types of methods :fetchCandy and updateCandyQuantity : Both are targeted from the view. both are handling UI actions, (candy view loading and add new candy)The other methods are constructing the data we will forward to view to be displayed.Note here that we are not passing the model to the view, Since the model has more way properties than the view needs actually. we pass instead a version of the model which is dedicated to the view. \u201cviewModel\u201d not to confuse with the MVVM viewModelAnd finally the view is is linked to the presenter in a bidirectional way.On one hand we have the presenter property, and on an other we have the CandyViewProtocol where the view receives data from the presenter.It\u2019s important here to note also that we are not talking about a viewController, but about a view, since in VIPER both are considered the same.Once all our our components ready, we bind them each other in a class called builder.Here is the final VIPER project.What\u2019s wrong with VIPER architectureWhen understanding how VIPER really works, we may think that single responsibility principle could not be better applied, and we could not get more structured. Although VIPER was for a long time the ultimate clean architecture application on iOS. Years of intensive use of VIPER has proven, that it\u2019s far from being perfect. Here\u2019s why :When we Zoom on the bidirectional relationship between the view and the presenter, we figure out that this last is doing two things :1 preparing data for the view.2 managing UI action.Actually, this is not really conform with single responsibility principle. In a way that the presenter itself ends up doing too much stuff when having a big project. While separation of concerns was the reason we avoided MVC in the first place.\u201cIt may seem convenient for the view controller to ask the presenter directly to format a string. But over time, you\u2019ll end up with a mess in your dependency graph\u201d\u2014 \u2018Raymond Law\u2019VIP as an improvement VIPER.Then Raymond Law came with an other logic to face that issue. He intended to apply Clean architecture on iOS in an other way.When i first heard about VIP, i thought to myself why would someone come up with a new architecture. Isn\u2019t VIPER complex enough ? \ud83e\udd14. In the third and last part of this article , we will try to answer this question.VIP doesn\u2019t mean a (Very Important Person). but it\u2019s for (ViewController, Interactor, Presenter). Unlike the other architectures (MVC, MVP, MVVM, VIPER\u2026). VIP name does not refer to its components. because VIP has actually the same components as VIPER. but the V \u2014 I \u2014 P is a reference to the components that make its particularity. ViewController, Interactor and Presenter are related and interact differently in VIP architecture (In that order !!).When we take a look at VIP structure. we notice the following points :View Controller is not considered anymore as View. As we had in VIPER. They are completely separated.ViewController is now the master piece instead of the presenter. It has a connection to all the other the other componentsWe don\u2019t have anymore the bidirectional link between ViewController and Presenter, like in VIPER. We have now circular flow of data, ViewController > Interactor > Presenter.Actually this circular data flow is what makes VIP an improvement over VIPER. In other words. instead of having the presenter handling UI actions and preparing data for the view. ViewController now passes the requests to the interactor, which has all business logic on it, and sends the result as a raw data to the presenter. which transforms it to the appropriate format (usually to ViewModels), which then sends it back to the viewController to be displayed.The advantage with this circular data flow is that each component can now focus on doing only one thing.VIP in practice.Now since the viewController is the central piece :It has a presenter , interactor and router properties.The viewController is passing UI actions directly to the interactor.The presenter is now lighter with only presentation data construction methods.And we can see the new architecture through the builder class knowing that all parts are now connected to the view controller.Here is the final VIP Demo project.ConclusionIn the same way that clean code architectures can make a big project well organised and structured. We should always keep in mind that implementing them the wrong way will lead to the opposite effect. that means if implemented without being aware of their technical details can only make the project messy and complex.An other point to take into account is the project scale. in many cases when having a small application with no business logic, MVC or MVP is more than enough.Always remember that there is no architecture that matches all the cases.Sure in the future, more new architectures will appear with new enhancements, this is how things evolve. Till then let\u2019s keep our architectures clean. \ud83d\ude0aThank you for reading. \ud83d\udc4dOriginally published in My Blog : SaadElOulladi.comReferences :https://medium.com/slalom-engineering/clean-architecture-for-ios-development-using-the-viper-pattern-fac30f5d29fchttps://theswiftdev.com/2018/03/12/the-ultimate-viper-architecture-tutorial/https://github.com/raywenderlich/SC_SusmitaHorrow/wiki/Clean-Architecture-for-iOShttps://medium.com/@piyush.dez/ios-architectures-5a19cd56edc2https://swifting.io/blog/2016/09/07/architecture-wars-a-new-hope/", "responses": 0, "tags": ["iOS", "VIP", "Viper", "Swift", "Clean Architecture"]}, {"title": "iOS design patterns \u2014 Part 2 (VIPER)", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@anup.harbade/ios-design-patterns-part-2-viper-fa3522b22b6b?source=search_post", "author_name": "Anup Harbade", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@anup.harbade", "publish_date": "2018-01-02", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-11", "readtime": "2.48", "claps": 155, "voters": 19, "content": "iOS design patterns \u2014 Part 2 (VIPER)Anup HarbadeFollowJan 2, 2018 \u00b7 3 min readIn the first part, here, we toured on MVC, MVP and MVVM, three of the most famous design patterns used in iOS application development. This final part will explore the VIPER design pattern.Lately, VIPER is treated as the extended version of MVVM which provides more modularity as compared to its contenders.VIPER module separationIt basically comprises of \u2014View(Controller) which presents UI to the user and forwards the actions on UI to the Presenter to handle.Presenter handles the UI actions sent by View. This handling is totally independent of the UI controls. In addition to this, Presenter takes help of the Interactor to process the model(Entity) if need be.Interactor mainly contains the business logic and integrates with the other parts of the application. It also owns and manages the Entity.Entity is just a dumb data structure to store data. As said, it is owned by the Interactor and concealed from the other modules.Router is a special component in the VIPER architecture, which explicitly deals with the navigation actions coming from the Presenter. The router can very well inject the dependencies through Presenter. Navigation (Wireframing) is the only responsibility that Router takes care of.As a good practice, iOS applications contain multiple storyboards, each representing the unique feature of the application. VIPER could very well be used in the same aspects. Instead of architecting a single screen, if a complete functionality, like creating a profile for the user, is architected through VIPER, the code will be finely modular and can be tested correctly. VIPER perfectly works in the direction of separating the responsibilities.Separation of responsibilities makes TDD(Test-Driven-Development) easier. In VIPER, test cases can be written against the functionality provided by the Interactor, as Interactor is the component which deals with the business logic.With these benefits, it does come with the pain of writing too many classes and maintaining them. Also, forwarding the events in the hierarchy is the duplication sometimes. VIPER comes with the strict learning curve too. There is a huge difference in the Apple\u2019s MVC and the VIPER.In my recent visits to the dev conferences, I have seen many developers and tech leads experimenting with this pattern and in their experiences, they have been highly benefited with it. In one such conference, Sonam Dhingra gave a wonderful talk on Using VIPER to build a framework.Sonam Dhingra presenting about VIPERConclusionThe design is the evolving process and design patterns are the output of it. As we all know there is no perfect design pattern which works for all the use cases and hence we have so many alternatives available. At the end, it totally depends on us, the developers, to think and decide, considering all the pros and cons. There is no obligation to use just one design pattern in the application, we could very well use a mix of all as per our need.Finally, thank you for taking out time to read this series of articles. I would appreciate your support for my future writings.

But when we are working in some big projects we need more than three layers to get a better code organization.The problem of using the plain MVC is the Controller classes handle a lot of work as we see below:MVC - Modelcontains entities objects;handles persistence of the each entities;handles the business logic.MVC - Controllerintermediate View and Model objects;handles the views and application logic;tests View logics, data transformation, basic validations;manage Keyboard, tableView delegate and datasource;handles navigation between views;manages and takes part in the responder chain used to handle events.MVC - Viewdraw and animate the interface;handle the user interaction passing data to Controllers.Note the Controller responsibility. It explains why developers use too manny #pragma mark to organize their codes. If your controller classes are huge, you have fallen into Massive View Controller problem.Ok, what can be done now? Searching in the web, there are some articles about another architecture called VIPER.A brief introduction about VIPERViper is an acronym for View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Routing. It has the following functionalities:Viper - Viewthey are dummy views;contain objects like UIView, UIViewController, UILabel, etc;waits the content from the Presenter;handle user interaction and pass it to Presenter layer.Viper - Presenterdoesn\u2019t know UI objects;get inputs from View layer;handle the view logic (add method will present other screen);Viper - Routinghandle the navigation logic and transition animations;knows objects like UINavigationController, UIWindow, etc;Viper - Interactorhandle the business rules described as use case;translate data between Entity and Presenter layers;Viper - Entityrepresent business objects;are simple data structures manipulated by Interactor;Translate the MVC to VIPER is a split task where each layer will lose some weights. See below how objects will move between both architecture:Moving from MVC to VIPER architectureSome criticsThere are some critics I noted after build my first project with VIPER definitions.First, Interactor objects represent one single use case. Sometimes it will be so small that it will increase the number of objects in your project;Second, Storyboard Segues will conflict with Routing layer;I think it's ok to use Storyboard Segues to represent the static routing in your application. Wireframes will be useful to turn it dynamic!Finally, basic configurations already setted in the Storyboard need to be recreated in Wireframes objects.ConclusionIt's clear that MVC is overdate to real projects and maybe it will lead you to maintain huges Controller classes. VIPER, in the other way, solve it adding more layers with clear objectives. It will costs a little bit more code to turn off some storyboard features but it's worth.ReferencesiOS Developer Library at http://developer.apple.comArchitecting iOS Apps with VIPER at http://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/viper/Cascavel Base Framework https://github.com/orafaelreis/cascavel", "responses": 0, "tags": ["iOS App Development", "Mvc", "Mobile Architecture"]}, {"title": "A viper\u2019s tooth in ancient human poo hints at snake-eating rituals", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@guglielm/a-vipers-tooth-in-ancient-human-poo-hints-at-snake-eating-rituals-38a329137ea7?source=search_post", "author_name": "Giorgia Guglielmi", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@guglielm", "publish_date": "2019-04-25", "last_modified_date": "2019-05-22", "readtime": "1.03", "claps": 5, "voters": 3, "content": "A viper\u2019s tooth in ancient human poo hints at snake-eating ritualsPrehistoric feces found in Texas includes scales, bones and a fang.Giorgia GuglielmiFollowApr 25 \u00b7 2 min readThis story was originally published in Nature.Everybody poos, but not all poos are alike. An ancient piece of dehydrated human dung contains the bones, scales and a fang of a venomous snake \u2014 an indication that the reptile might have been eaten whole, likely as part of a ritual event.Ancient peoples of North America routinely ate snakes, even poisonous ones, usually after they removed the scales and head. But when Elanor Sonderman at Texas A&M University in College Station and her colleagues analysed a 1,500-year-old sample of human dung found in Texas, they identified 22 snake bones, 48 snake scales and a 1-centimetre-long snake fang. This suggests that the reptile, likely a western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), was eaten whole and unskinned.Many peoples, including Indigenous groups in the southwestern United States, worshipped snakes, leading the team to propose that the animal was consumed during a ceremony or ritual. The feces also contain the remains of a small rodent, consumed whole and apparently raw. But whether the rodent had been the human\u2019s or the snake\u2019s meal is unclear, the researchers say.Image credits: Clinton & Charles Robertson / CC BY 2.0", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Science", "Nature", "Animals", "Snakes"]}, {"title": "The Beginning of an MVP", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@viperdev_io/the-beginning-of-an-mvp-9fb26576d262?source=search_post", "author_name": "Viper Development", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@viperdev_io", "publish_date": "2017-12-14", "last_modified_date": "2018-02-26", "readtime": "2.65", "claps": 8, "voters": 4, "content": "The Beginning of an MVPViper DevelopmentFollowDec 14, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readCreated by Photoroyalty \u2014 Freepik.comViper Development is a Software Development company that helps startups to bring their app to the store within no time on a tight budget.What\u2019s this blog for?This blog post is a little FAQ about what we\u2019re starting here.

It is argued that VIPER is especially useful when it comes to testing. Test-Driven-Development is a major mantra in iOS. VIPER adhered to the TDD format by allowing developers an easier way to isolate and debug their errors. I would also argue that VIPER promotes the SRP( Single-Responsibility-Principle)? Conceptually, VIPER divides up tasks to reduce complexity. The general idea is to reduce your app\u2019s dependencies by balancing delegation responsibilities amongst entities.MAIN PARTS OF VIPER:\u00b7 View \u2014 This is the interface layer incorporating the UIKit elements. The UIViewController\u2019s subclasses should belong to the view layer in a more decoupled fashion. When thinking about the VIEW, VIPER is similar to MVVM, because views are responsible for displaying what the presenter asks them to , and then transmit the user input back to the presenter.\u00b7 Interactor \u2014 This contains the heart of the business logic. The interactor fetches data from the model (using network or local database), and its implementation is totally independent from the user interface. VIPER treats the network and database managers as separate dependencies because they are not part of VIPER.\u00b7 Presenter \u2014 The presenter contains the necessary logic to format the data that will be displayed. In MVVVM, the ViewModelController handles this logic. The presenter receives data from the interactor, instantiates a view model and carries it to the VIEW. Furthermore, it reacts to user inputs, asking for more data or sending it back to the interactor.\u00b7 Entity \u2014 Has part of the responsibilities of the model layer in the other architectures. Entities are plain data objects, with no business logic, managed by the interactor and by the data managers.\u00b7 Router \u2014 The navigation logic of the application. It might not seem like an important layer, but if you have to reuse the same iPhone views in a iPad application, the only thing that might change is the way that the views are presented. This lets your other layers remain untouched, and the Router is responsible for the navigation flow in each situation.USE CASES:\u00b7 Working in small teams, new developer(s) that join can easily work on particular module and thus dividing up work is less of a nuisance.\u00b7 It\u2019s easier to track issues via crash reports (due to the Single Responsibility Principle)\u00b7 Adding new features is easier\u00b7 The source code will be cleaner, more compact and reusable\u00b7 There are less conflicts with the rest of the development team\u00b7 It\u2019s easier to write automated tests (!), since your UI logic is separated from the business logic.DON\u2019T USE:There are a lot of elements involved causing an overhead on new projects. If you are working on a small project that\u2019s not intended to scale, this may not be the best architecture for you. Simultaneously, everyone on your team needs to be on board or you\u2019ll end up with a hybrid MVC-VIPER scenario, which is just as much of a headache.Fuck the M(assive)VC.As beginners too often we let our View Controller increase in lines, mass and sass. A downfall of the MVC is that, the VC\u2019s responsibility becomes too loosely defined and thus leading it to have more than one responsibility.Choose your architecture responsibly!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["iOS", "Android"]}, {"title": "iOS Application with VIPER Architecture", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@ahmedaskar1989/viper-architecture-7a5bb9598ff5?source=search_post", "author_name": "Ahmed Askar", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ahmedaskar1989", "publish_date": "2018-10-30", "last_modified_date": "2018-11-01", "readtime": "3.02", "claps": 12, "voters": 4, "content": "iOS Application with VIPER ArchitectureAhmed AskarFollowOct 30, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readGood architecture is not what makes a product successful, but it does make a product maintainable and helps preserve the sanity of the people maintaining it.In this article, we will introduce an approach to iOS application architecture called VIPER. VIPER has been used to build many large projects, but for the purposes of this article we will be showing you what is and why VIPER.Why VIPER?The question now in your mind why should i go to use a pattern beside MVC however this is the design pattern (MVC) that recommended and released by Apple.During the development process of iOS Application :You want to build the application on Single responsibility principle.You want to add, refactor or fix feature in something is maintainable.You want to reduce the dependency between layers.But, we have a common problem in using (Model-View-Controller) and i will call it fat controllers. Since some of business logic has been written and handled in the controller, handling UI presentation logic in the controller, managing UI components in the controller, navigation between screens. at the end we see a huge file which becomes very hard to manage specially if your project is to be scalable.VIPERClean Architecture divides an app\u2019s logical structure into distinct layers of responsibility. This makes it easier to isolate dependencies (e.g. your database) and to test the interactions at the boundaries between layers.VIPER architecture allows for a clearer separation of concerns and separates the viewController from handling most of the responsibility in an app. Concerns are separated into modules for each use case (i.e. provide a map for the user). Each module has a clear layer of routing logic, presentation logic and business logic.VIPER is an application of Clean Architecture to iOS apps. The word VIPER means View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Routing. helps you to make the structure.VIPER FlowView (UIView/UIViewController)Display info to the user and detects user interactions and perform animations.Owns and sends user actions to the presenter.Communicate with the presenter to perform these actions.InteractorAn Interactor represents a single use case in the app.It contains the business logic to manipulate model objects (Entities) to carry out a specific task.Fetches and stores data from a manager class like DataManager or NetworkManagerInteractor should be independent of any UI.PresenterThe presenter receives user actions from the View/ViewController and decide one of three things :Fetching data from Interactor (contains business logic) and preparing data for presentation and pass it back to the View/ViewController so i can update the view.Prepare data direct without fetching anything from the the Interactor and pass it back again to the View.Will use the Router to perform the navigation.EntityThe entities are our data models (i.e. Post, Room, New).These entities are manipulated by the Interactor.The Interactor has full knowledge of the entities and their properties.The Interactor never passes entities to the presentation layer.RouterRoutes from one screen to another are defined in the wireframes created by an interaction designer.The responsibility for Routing is shared between two objects: the Presenter, and the wireframe.A wireframe object owns the UIWindow, UINavigationController, UIViewController, etc.A wireframe is responsible for creating a View/ViewController and installing it in the window.The Presenter contains the logic to react to user inputs and knows when to navigate to another screen, and which screen to navigate to. Meanwhile, the wireframe knows how to navigate. So, the Presenter will use the wireframe to perform the navigation. Together, they describe a route from one screen to the next.The wireframe is also an obvious place to handle navigation transition animations.My view about VIPERVIPER is an architecture pattern which helps you to separate your logic when your app is very large and scalable but take care:You have to write down a lot of code.You have a lot of files in your project.Communication between layers become a little difficult.If you have a small project and not scalable i recommend to use MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel).ReferenceArchitecting iOS Apps with VIPER \u2014 ObjC", "responses": 1, "tags": ["iOS", "Swift", "Design Patterns", "Viper", "Clean Architect"]}, {"title": "Tube Viper X Review & Discount 80% Only 5 Days", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@trungle/tube-viper-x-review-discount-80-only-5-days-2da44fb541fd?source=search_post", "author_name": "TrungLee", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@trungle", "publish_date": "2014-08-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-05", "readtime": "1.47", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Tube Viper X Review & Discount 80% Only 5 DaysTrungLeeFollowAug 13, 2014 \u00b7 2 min readOne click video X-ray vision?Hi,If you have tried to rank videos on YouTube, you know how tough it can be.You have to do the research, get good keywords, keep close attention to your competitors\u2019 channels\u2026\u2026and with Google hiding tags, it\u2019s even more difficult \u2013 not to mention extremely time consuming.Luckily, there is good news!My friend Lisa Allen has just released a brand-new software that gives video marketers X-ray vision.Let me explain\u2026With this tool, you can see everything behind the scenes the most guarded secrets of your competitors.You\u2019ll see why their video are ranking high, what\u2019s their description, how many likes, dislikes, views they have, etc.It even gets you those hidden tags we need!Getting this tool is like when Neo could read the Matrix.It\u2019s called Tube Viper X.

Tout comme d\u2019autres services VPN comparables, VyprVPN offre de nombreuses fonctionnalit\u00e9s pour les diff\u00e9rents besoins des utilisateurs. VyprVPN peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour contourner les restrictions de sites Web ou le filtrage mis en place par les gouvernements. L\u2019utilisation d\u2019un VPN peut permettre aux utilisateurs de naviguer sur Internet en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et en priv\u00e9. Ci-dessus est notre avis VyprVPN pour le mieux comprendre.Installation et configurationLe processus d\u2019installation et de configuration est relativement facile. VyprVPN est fourni comme un service configurable manuellement, configur\u00e9 en utilisant les param\u00e8tres LAN. Une fois que vous effectuez le paiement et vous abonnez \u00e0 leur service, VyprVPN vous enverra quelques param\u00e8tres qui incluent le nom d\u2019utilisateur, le mot de passe et les proxies IP ainsi que les param\u00e8tres LAN. Ces informations peuvent ensuite \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es pour configurer l\u2019acc\u00e8s VPN via vos param\u00e8tres LAN. Si vous avez des questions ou si vous \u00eates coinc\u00e9 \u00e0 mi-parcours de votre configuration, il existe diff\u00e9rents tutoriels pour vous aider pendant la configuration.Vous pouvez modifier la plupart des param\u00e8tres et rediriger votre acc\u00e8s \u00e0 travers diff\u00e9rentes IP, serveurs, protocoles de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et toute une s\u00e9rie d\u2019autres fonctionnalit\u00e9s via l\u2019application VyprVPN. L\u2019application est propre et \u00e9pur\u00e9e, avec toutes les fonctionnalit\u00e9s facilement accessibles. L\u2019application VyprVPN est disponible pour Windows et Mac OS X, iOS et appareils Android et Linux (uniquement compatible avec la configuration manuelle). Il fonctionne aussi tr\u00e8s bien avec l\u2019iPad.Il existe des tutoriels pour vous aider \u00e0 installer et configurer le logiciel, ou vous pouvez \u00e9galement contacter leur service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le. VyprVPN prend en charge une gamme de protocoles de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, allant de PPTP 1280 bits, 156 bits L2TP et 160 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 256 OpenVPN. VyprVPN a \u00e9galement introduit leur propre protocole propri\u00e9taire appel\u00e9 Chameleon. Ce protocole est id\u00e9al pour \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 dans les pays o\u00f9 il ya des blocages de trafic VPN agressifs via Deep Packet Inspection (DPI).Parlant de nouvelles fonctionnalit\u00e9s, notre avis sur VyprVPN montre qu\u2019il semble constamment introduire de nouvelles fonctionnalit\u00e9s pour leurs utilisateurs. Parmi les derniers ajouts est une fonction SmartDNS appel\u00e9e VyprDNS. SmartDNS a les m\u00eames fonctionnalit\u00e9s que VPN en termes de contourner le contenu g\u00e9o-bloqu\u00e9, mais est plus rapide car il, contrairement \u00e0 VPN, ne crypte pas les donn\u00e9es.

As technology progressed, human being starts to record information such as events and knowledge such as medical practices into papers and books. Papers and books are one of the greatest inventions in terms of technology and knowledge recording as well as knowledge transfer. Even after so many centuries, and in the 21st century, human beings still rely on papers and books to keep information, to put in notes, ideas and knowledge.As the years gone by, information is needed in an instant and covering so many distances, hence the internet is the one that is being used to store and share information across the globe and can be accessible at any time by any users.Human beings are getting smarter in getting information: in the beginning only handwritings, drawings and letters are possible to be recorded, humanity had push boundaries and able to record sound and real-world images. As the years went by, human beings are able to capture not only images but multiple images and frames in one timeframe which is basically what video is.All imaginary and videos at the earliest days are captured in films. As the technology advanced, imaginaries and videos can be recreated digitally. That is when binary fits into the story. As the computers are able to compute more binaries and numbers, the images and videos are able to be clearer and sharper. However, the clearer the picture or video, the more pixels and resolutions are needed, the more numbers and binaries involved, the more memories are needed to be stored.Storage of information progresses, from papers to filmstrips (Cassettes, VHS, USB drive). As the world needs bigger storage and meeting the demand to have memories and information readily accessible, plus with the fact of the presence of wireless internet: the newest technological achievement is the creation of cloud storage.Cloud storage\u2019s main idea is just like the name itself, it is to store memories in \u2018the cloud\u2019 because you don\u2019t have to have your own hardware to keep the memories. You just need the internet to have the memories transferred from your computer or devices into the cloud storage.This is quite similar to faith.Faith is like an internet connection, you have to be able to connect to it and recognise that there is something out there. The storage is like something that you don\u2019t possess. You are entrusting your faith by saving the memories in the cloud storage. The cloud storage is analogous to the higher being whom all your concerns go to if you let it. You can get the memories back if you make an effort to be connected to the internet and know where you keep it in and when you keep it. Miracles can happen to you and prayers can be answered, but you got to play your parts as well.Going towards a mini conclusion, there are many forces and powerful thing in our life that is involving science and faith are the unseen forces. But the forces that we can see in our life is also full of mysteries and there is so much more backstory of light that we would like to know more and to dive into. For now, we will make full use of it to enrich our lives and to make sense of our surroundings.Excerpted with permission from \u2018The Science of Faith\u2019, where the concept of faith and God is explained via existing famous scientific theories and knowledge.Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Vyner Mano.

Traveling back and forth between Virtual Reality and the real world, we see the constant struggle of characters on hard topics like identity, family duty and sexual fluidity.In the story, we follow our main character Daniel (Anthony Mackie) as he reunites with his college roommate Karl (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II)in a birthday party and is given a VR game Striking Vipers X, a mortal combat game with all physical sensation of the avatar simulated. The two guys meet in the game, try fighting against each other like the old times as Roxette and Lance, and the scene quickly escalates into an erotic entanglement \u2013 yes, the two have sex inside the game. Things start to collapse since then: Danny\u2019s bizarre midnight virtual affair is having real life effect to his marriage, and it poses a question on his own sexuality \u2013 is he falling in love with his buddy after all these years? Interestingly, the answer is no. The psychology behind is far more complex than a simple story about being a secret gay.On Role play, Identity and Sexual FluidityThe whole story circulates on the idea of role-playing and how it offers us a second identity. Right from the beginning, we audience are introduced to a confident and seemingly flirtatious Danny trying to hook up with Theo(Nicole Beharie) in a club, only to realise that they are in fact a couple role-playing as strangers to get sexual excitement. Afterwards and throughout the show, Danny is presented as a quiet man confined in perhaps the most mundane suburban robotic life with a regular office job, Theo now as his wife and a little kid. Going through mid-life crisis, the excitement to live as Lance, this muscular handsome young lad, instantly clicks right in \u2014 he is now revived in age, free from knee problem and is able to do all kinds of martial moves you could ever imagine. His muscular big friend Karl too, has now transformed into a cute blonde with soft and firm skin. Despite having sex together, it does not \u201cfeel like a gay thing\u201d, as they have now become their avatar, not just physically but sensationally. Although Danny wrestle with his feelings for Karl (Roxette), in their final confrontation, we see that they do not have the same sexual attraction through intimacy in real life. They are not really gay, but is crazily in love with each other as Lance and Roxette. What is that then?Role play offers us a fluidity in identity. After all, what defines us as \u201cus\u201d? With our face, status and even names taken away, what is left is solely our consciousness. We are allowed to regard one another as not the ordinary self, but something or someone completely different. Again, this is NOT a story about being straight or gay, but more about abandoning the categorizations and be true to whatever you feel. Although Lance and Roxette are just avatars, it does not feel that way for Danny and Karl. If our identity is unstable, how could we be sure about our sexuality too? When the normal identity melts down with all restrictions run loose, our characters are now offered a wider freedom on sexuality, or even becomes queer in this sense. Love comes with certain conditions, but those conditions could vary according to different contexts. Perhaps it explains why Karl could not catch the same feeling with another Lance, another computer player or the Polar Bear character. He does not randomly fall for any Lance, but the Lance of Danny, and vice versa. Could we say he \u201cloves\u201d Danny? No, not exactly. The show successfully plays with the fluidity of identity and sexuality, reflecting the dynamics of love and relationship in a world where there is no clear boundary.On Virtual Affair, Body and SoulIf a man falls in love with another person mentally but never engages in physical intimacy, can he still be considered as cheating? This question is similar to the one of emotional and physical cheating, but it is sort of different as the cheating target is not a real person. Yet, the damage of the virtual affair Danny has is as powerful as a real one. The more sexual pleasure he has in the VR as Lance, the more quiet and disengaged he is in real life \u2014 he rejects all the intimacy with his wife, gets constantly drifted away at work and even stops playing with his own kid (We all know that playing with little kid could be a bit boring, but come on, what needs to be done has to be done). At the day of Danny and Theo\u2019s anniversary, we are presented this awkward dinner with Theo having a family-commitment monologue, talking about what sacrifices one has to make for committing to a monogamous family. Marriage as it has always been, is more than lust and affection. It also comes with compromises, duty and care. As an audience, we sympathies with Theo who suffers from her husband\u2019s negligence. But when she says \u201cI just want to know. I\u2019ll deal with it how I deal with it. I just have to know\u201d, we again understands why Danny chooses to keep it to himself at that point. Emotional cheating is a form of cheating, but cheating physically inside your own head with a person that does not exist in real world \u2014 the line becomes much blurrier.\u201cStriking Vipers\u201d offers us a seemingly satisfactory solution. After a fist fight in the rain with Karl, Danny opens up to Theo about his virtual affair. In the end, he gets to continue his meetup with Karl (Roxette) in his birthday, while Theo takes off her wedding ring and goes out for a hookup in town. Marriage comes with certain rules and conditions agreed by two people, but these confinements are often predetermined by the social norm. Affair therefore, is disgraceful as it involves a breach of promises and often involves lies, betrayal and rejection. But what if the two people both agree to rewrite the terms and get satisfaction for things that seems inappropriate? Marriage, just like identity and sexuality, is an imaginary construct \u2014 it could be deconstructed and reconstructed. As long as nobody\u2019s getting hurt and it works, who could say that something is \u201cwrong\u201d about it? In the end, at least I am happy to see our characters are finally free from struggles and judgements, and enjoy their lives exactly as how they want it to be.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Relationships", "Black Mirror", "Identity", "Sexuality", "Netflix"]}, {"title": "2015 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 VS. 2015 Dodge SRT Viper", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@MarionCohrs/2015-chevrolet-corvette-z06-vs-2015-dodge-srt-viper-133c31cb3697?source=search_post", "author_name": "Marion J.

Last year everybody was in love with the Corvette Stingray, but now Chevy has made the new 2015 Chevy Corvette Z06, which is better than the stingray! The Z06 looks very similar to the stingray with some minor differences. The Dodge Viper has also stepped up this year\u2019s model.The 2015 Chevy Corvette Z06 & the 2015 Dodge Viper SRT both have an incredible design. They are two of the coolest looking cars that you can get for under $100k. The most important thing for me is that they are both American cars, and there are no other American cars that look as cool as these two do. The new Corvette is the closest street legal Corvette ever to match the racing version of the C7.R. The Dodge Viper SRT starts at $84,995 & the Corvette Z06 starts a price of $78,995. Now, let\u2019s talk about the power of these supercars next.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u2014 dodge cummins performance parts \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014If you like muscle cars then check out this article: 2015 Chevy Camaro VS 2015 Ford Mustang VS 2015 Dodge ChallengerCorvette Z06 & Viper SRT SpecsThe 2015 Corvette Z06 has a 6.2L V8 engine with 650 horse power & 650lb-ft of torque! The 2015 Viper SRT has an 8.4L V10 engine with 645 horsepower & 600 lb.-ft. of torque. The Corvette wins in the horsepower category but just by 5 HP! The 2015 Viper SRT has a 6-speed manual transmission. Once again the Corvette Z06 comes on top here as well. The Corvette comes with either a 7-speed manual transmission or an 8-speed paddle-shift automatic transmission. As for the 0\u201360 MPH the Viper gets in the low 3 second range and the Corvette gets 2.95 seconds so the Corvette slightly wins here too! The Corvette is the cheaper of the two cars and is so far winning in this race. When it comes to top speed they both can get slightly over 200 MPH and are close to equal there. The Viper has a top speed of 206MPH while the Corvette Z06 hasn\u2019t officially announced its top speed, it should also be slightly over 200 MPH.2015 Corvette TrimsThe new 2015 Chevy Corvette Z06 comes in three different trims which are the 1LZ, 2LZ, & 3LZ. The 1LZ is the lightest of the trims, but still has many unexpected features. Some of them are: a 9 speaker Bose audio system; two 8 inch color displays; 8-way power seats; a rear camera; a 7-speed transmission and more! The 2LZ has convenience & comfort features including console & door armrests & color-keyed instrument panels. It also includes everything the 1LZ does & more. Some of the added features are: lumber/wing adjust; heated & vented seats; a 10 speaker Bose audio system; Sirius satellite radio with 1 year subscription; universal home remote; enhanced theft deterrent package & more! The 3LZ has the most sport & luxury feel to it. It has everything the 1LZ & 2LZ have plus a leather rapped color keyed interior; sueded microfiber upper interior trim package; performance data recorder; navigation; Napa leather seating surfaces; blue interior color option; & custom leather rapped interior package.Article Source: http://bit.ly/2kiu9MSArticle Posted By: dodge cummins performance parts", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Cars", "Automotive", "Dodge Cummins Performance", "Dodge Cummins", "Dodgers"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@VPERACTO/importance-of-informatica-online-training-program-course-in-it-sector-5c668fa24e56?source=search_post", "author_name": "Vperacto Online Training Center", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@VPERACTO", "publish_date": "2016-05-25", "last_modified_date": "2016-05-25", "readtime": "1.14", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Vperacto Online Training CenterFollowMay 25, 2016 \u00b7 2 min readImportance of Informatica Online Training Program Course in IT SectorThe significance and enthusiasm of online training & tutorial courses has augmented in the midst of the beginner as it has bring revolutionary changes in learning style.

Existen muchas arquitecturas de desarrollo pero entre las m\u00e1s conocidas est\u00e1n MVC y VIPER. MVC es una arquitectura simple para desarrollar aplicaciones con velocidad y que no vayan a tener un amplio futuro de crecimiento. Sin embargo VIPER se usa para aplicaciones con amplia escalabilidad ya que esta arquitectura respeta los principios SOLID haciendo especial hincapi\u00e9 en el principio de simple responsabilidad.\u00bfQu\u00e9 es VIPER?Una arquitectura de software que respeta al m\u00e1ximo el principio de simple responsabilidad de SOLID. Sirve para hacer una aplicaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s modular y f\u00e1cil de mantener. Esta arquitectura est\u00e1 totalmente orientada a protocolos que es algo que deber\u00edamos controlar en Swift.Un m\u00f3dulo de VIPER tiene unos componentes que lo forman: View, Presenter, Interactor, Entity y Router.Esta separaci\u00f3n del modelo y la vista provocan una abstracci\u00f3n que permite que una aplicaci\u00f3n de gran volumen sea f\u00e1cil de mantener y limpia. Empezar\u00e9 con un orden de menor a mayor ya que me parece m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil de entender.1. EntityEste es sin duda el componente m\u00e1s b\u00e1sico de VIPER ya que no deber\u00eda tener nada m\u00e1s que propiedades, claro est\u00e1 sin relaci\u00f3n con vistas ni ning\u00fan otro componente que no sea un entity.2. InteractorEl componente del interactor tiene una responsabilidad b\u00e1sica aunque importante. Obtiene los datos de los web services o base de datos, crea los objetos de las entidades o entity y se los proporciona al presenter. Es importante destacar que el interactor no tiene ninguna relaci\u00f3n con la vista, de hecho no deber\u00eda siquiera importar a UIKit, con Foundation deber\u00eda ser suficiente. Tampoco debe tener ninguna l\u00f3gica m\u00e1s que la necesaria para formar los entity y obtener los datos.3. PresenterEl presenter es el componente m\u00e1s importante de VIPER junto con el interactor ya que act\u00faa como puente entre los m\u00f3dulos de VIPER y contiene la l\u00f3gica de negocio. Recibe los eventos de la vista y reacciona a ellos pidiendo los datos necesarios al interactor. En sentido opuesto recibe los datos del interactor, aplica la l\u00f3gica y prepara el contenido para pas\u00e1rselo a la vista y que esta lo muestre.4. ViewB\u00e1sicamente es un ViewController que contiene sub vistas implementadas programaticamente o mediante XIB. La vista tiene como \u00fanica responsabilidad mostrar en la interfaz la informaci\u00f3n que llega desde el presenter y recoger eventos del usuario deleg\u00e1ndolos al presentador.5. RouterEs el encargado de la navegaci\u00f3n y de pasar datos entre vistas. Debe implementar un protocolo que incluya todas las posibilidades de navegaci\u00f3n entre m\u00f3dulos. Debido a como es el sistema de iOS para realizar la navegaci\u00f3n el router tiene que conocer a la view (ViewController)\u00bfCuando usar VIPER?Debemos usar VIPER cuando nos encontramos con un proyecto que vaya a ser muy escalable. Adem\u00e1s la arquitectura de VIPER ayuda a trabajar m\u00e1s de un desarrollador en la misma app. Gracias a la modularidad podremos encontrar errores m\u00e1s f\u00e1cilmente, a\u00f1adir nuevas funcionalidades f\u00e1cilmente, el c\u00f3digo estar\u00e1 m\u00e1s ordenado, habr\u00e1 menos conflictos con los dem\u00e1s desarrolladores y es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil escribir test unitarios.\u00bfCuando no usar VIPER?Puede ser un contra en proyectos peque\u00f1os que no tengan futuro de escalabilidad ya que desarrollar la arquitectura gasta m\u00e1s tiempo que una MVC.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Swift", "Clean Architecture", "Viper", "Solid", "Programming"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@Vipergatesystems.com/viper-gate-systems-gate-opener-automatic-gate-opener-vipergatesystems-com-d73ed1b89dc0?source=search_post", "author_name": "JT", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@Vipergatesystems.com", "publish_date": "2016-09-30", "last_modified_date": "2016-09-30", "readtime": "0.31", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "JTFollowSep 30, 2016 \u00b7 1 min readViper Gate Systems | Gate opener | automatic gate opener | vipergatesystems.com \u2014 vipergatesystems.comViper gate systems \u2014 We carry a large selection of gate openers, electric openers, gate remotes.http://www.vipergatesystems.com/", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@seventeegrew/harlequin-snake-the-vermin-viper-of-dhaka-32095c234da2?source=search_post", "author_name": "Seven Tee-Grew", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@seventeegrew", "publish_date": "2018-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-07-14", "readtime": "0.44", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Seven Tee-GrewFollowJul 13, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readHarlequin Snake the vermin viper of DhakaHarlequin Snake the vermin viperSlithers silentlyLeaving the gutters and sewers of DhakaTo strikeUnfolding her poisonous charm on the unsuspectingHiding behind layers of tafetta and silkShe moves inTo lure the lonely and lovelornHarlequin Snake has played this game beforeShe moves with dexterity toCapture and TameTo break heartsTime and againHer well practiced methodsLure with her doleful eyesEntice with her captivating storyStrikePoor old ScrofaHe can\u2019t believe his luckAnd neither can weOr will weFor Harlequin SnakeWill wait patientlyTake what she wantsThen goLeaving poor old scrofaOlder and Alone again", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Travel", "Dhaka", "Bangladesh", "Harlequin", "Snakes"]}, {"title": "Dodge Dealer In North Carolina Ordered 99% Of All 2017 Vipers Remaining", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@autobuzzer/dodge-dealer-in-north-carolina-ordered-99-of-all-2017-vipers-remaining-5450b1fdccb3?source=search_post", "author_name": "Faisal Asim", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@autobuzzer", "publish_date": "2016-10-12", "last_modified_date": "2016-10-12", "readtime": "0.35", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Dodge Dealer In North Carolina Ordered 99% Of All 2017 Vipers RemainingFaisal AsimFollowOct 12, 2016 \u00b7 1 min readA Dodge dealership in Salisbury, North Carolina are claiming to have ordered almost all remaining 2017 model year Vipers.

That has since been debunked in 1964 after the announcement of the Dr Luther Terry, the Surgeon General\u2019s report on the ill effects of smoking. [link]Vaping has had a relatively short history. We attempt to look at the evidence thus far.Marini S1, Buonanno G2, Stabile L3, Ficco G3., Short-term effects of electronic and tobacco cigarettes on exhaled nitric oxide, Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2014 Jul 1;278(1):9\u201315. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2014.04.004. Epub 2014 Apr 13This article looked at the short term respiratory effects of e-cigarettes versus conventional cigarettes. They measured exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) as a representation of the average particle deposited in the alveolar and transbronchial region of the lungs. Vaping and conventional cigarettes had similar effects and was, as expected, higher than controls. So vaping certainly does not do less harm to the deeper regions of the lungs.Tierney PA1, Karpinski CD2, Brown JE1, Luo W2, Pankow JF3., Flavour chemicals in electronic cigarette fluids, Tob Control. 2015 Apr 15. pii: tobaccocontrol-2014\u2013052175. doi: 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2014\u2013052175. [Epub ahead of print]This looked at the content of e-cigarette fluids. Many had aldehydes, known lung irritants and other formulations/chemicals which are of toxicological concern. The concern is the poor regulations surrounding the production of these fluids and many of them are unlabelled. Many are also self-produced by those trading with these fluids.There are still many unknowns with vaping. The long term effects will likely be better known in many years to come, especially when more people pick this habit up. It is unfortunate that we are likely to repeat the past and the errors of judgement and deceit prevalent during the heydays of cigarette smoking. Pro vapers have used the notoreity of cigarette smoking to justify their existence, without truly understanding the safety surrounding vaping.Giroud, de Cesare, Berthet, Varlet, Concha-Lozano, Favrat, E-Cigarettes: A Review of New Trends in Cannabis Use, Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2015 Aug 21;12(8):9988\u201310008. doi: 10.3390/ijerph120809988.Vaping apparatus opens up a new method of \u2018smoking\u2019 illicit drugs. It brings a dark parallel to the days of opium smoking. There is nothing dissimilar in this episode. Malaysia\u2019s fight against drugs could take an unfortunate turn with the acceptance of vaping. It will create a new environment where the battle against drugs could get complicated and more widespread.We should not succumb to a still small numbers of pro-vapers, and sacrifice the future of generations to come, just to score a few brownie points.

I speak Spanish, some French and very little Hebrew. If you were to ask me how I learned English Grammar in the USA School System, I would tell you in the 1970's where I grew up, in English Class, you were doing plays by The English guy who lived on the Temps River and wrote Romeo and Juliet\u2026 we all know his name, but I am letting you in on where the mind cannot think of that man that wrote so many plays that I cannot even understand 1 with my USA English\u2026.

The word starts with the letter \u201cC\u201d and would only be used on a Woman in the USA and once you say it, start to run.. fast.They were calling a Man, this term that is only used with a Woman here in the USA.

Obviously, it protects your head from any bumps or shots and allows for extra gear to be mounted on\u2013including night vision.There are many replicas available on the market, from the cheap plain helmets with limited comfort and customisation to more expensive ones and those that are built better.Thanks to Military1st we had the chance to try out the Viper Fast Helmet which is a replica of the Ops-Core FAST XP High Cut helmet.HelmetI don\u2019t think anybody needs an introduction to what an Ops-Core FAST helmet is. Everybody knows them and they are very common to see on the airsoft battlefield\u2013at least the replica ones.The model we were testing was the in olive drab colour. Unlike most of other units from FMA or Emerson, that normally come in ranger green, this one looked much nicer. You can tell by the rails sections on the sides that it\u2019s painted. Most other manufacturers only provide a Multicam version that\u2019s painted\u2013the rest of the them come with the plastic in a particular colour. This actually is a good thing as it creates a much better looking layer.The helmet comes with the standard set of accessories: side rails, Head-Loc attachment points for glasses, 2 rail segments, night vision shroud which is a plastic replica of the Ops-Core VAS shroud and the padding.The padding is the most interesting bit simply because it\u2019s the best padding system I\u2019ve seen in the replica helmets. It\u2019s much thicker and therefore much more comfortable. Just for this thing alone, the Viper helmet is worth getting instead of any other replica.The bungee retention system looks to be more solid too. I\u2019ve broken pretty much every single bungee from any other brand. The Viper ones are still there!The helmet shell is also much thicker. It replicates the weight a bit better and feels more sturdy and also helps when attaching any other shrouds or night vision mounting systems as they usually expect the shell to be thick anyway. I\u2019ve tried attaching a Norotos 3-point shroud and it works great.The whole liner kit looks at feels sturdy as well. The quality of the straps is good with double stitching in the important places, the chin strap has a nice piece of softer fake leather to improve the comfort. The buckle is not great and sometimes can be hard to disconnect\u2013a minor annoyance.The only issue I had, was with the adjustment dial at the back. It just does not hold its position well, and any faster movement of your head and it would slightly undo itself. This was especially evident when having night vision on the front of the helmet and a battery pack on the back. Basically, any added weight to the helmet would result in slow undoing of the tension.What was a really nice addition, was the fact that the included instructions were also very helpful. Two colour leaflets had great information on how to adjust the helmet to your shape and size of your head but also, how to properly install a headset system, such as Peltor Comtacs\u2013a very nice touch!SummaryAll in all I really like the Viper FAST helmet. I was impressed with the quality of finish. The padding system is simply great and unseen in other replicas. I like the thickness of the shell and the liner set. Again, the only issue I had, was with the retention dial, and could be an issue with my particular model only.Originally published on TacticalTwo", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Tactical", "Airsoft", "Milsim"]}, {"title": "Viper Tactical Elite Jacket and Contractors Pants", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@TacticalTwo/viper-tactical-elite-jacket-and-contractors-pants-a94af4a3da38?source=search_post", "author_name": "TacticalTwo", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@TacticalTwo", "publish_date": "2016-07-26", "last_modified_date": "2016-07-26", "readtime": "4.21", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Viper Tactical Elite Jacket and Contractors PantsTacticalTwoFollowJul 26, 2016 \u00b7 5 min readJackets! Trousers! Grey! Titanium! Oh my! Viper Tactical have released their new version of the Titanium jacket and trousers and thanks to Military1st we can show you what they came up with.Elite JacketThe Viper Elite Jacket is a new version of a water resistant micro shell made out of breathable fibre fabric called Taslon that\u2019s very lightweight and similar to cotton in look and feel. It improves over cotton in many ways as it utilises the latest fibre technology and at the same time provides natural feel.What we\u2019re getting is a very good product, comparable to other brands such as Helikon but at even more affordable price.It\u2019s packed with features too! Apart from being water resistant which is its main premise, the Elite Jacket comes with 5 external pockets. Two upper arm zipped pockets include an elasticated inner D-ring and a rubberised headphone port in case you want to put your phone or radio and weave the cable through. Outside, the pockets are covered with large 4x4 inch Velcro patches for your identification needs.The central zipped pocket also features a headphone port and a nice soft-material sleeve to keep your device secure. On the lower left sleeve you can also find an additional zipped pocket for extra storage.As most of similar products, this jacket also contains underarm zipped vents which enable you to get more breathability during warmer days, definitely a plus. Cuffs come with neat rubberised Velcro adjustment to keep the perfect size.The main two-way YKK zipper includes a nice chin protector, so you don\u2019t have to be worried to catch your skin with it. Most of the zipper feature a non-slip pull tab with a pretty cool Viper logo.At the bottom you\u2019ll find a bungee retention system for the waist to allow a slicker fit around your body.Not to be forgotten is the foldable hood that can be stored in the collar. It features a full bungee system to help keeping it in place and shape it to the users desire.All in all, we were very happy with the quality of the product. It features reinforcements where needed, such as reinforced elbows. As most soft shells it\u2019s very comfortable, soft and pleasant in touch and comes in a great price. Oh, and this trendy grey colour that we like!Contractors PantsI\u2019m a big fan of these trousers. After owning older Viper BDUs and some other Helikon pants, I really enjoyed testing these. Like the jacket, they come in Titanium grey colour and are made out of 60% polyester and 40% Ripstop cotton.The wide belt loops allow to to use belts of almost any size and make sure that the trousers don\u2019t move. The back of the waist is elasticated which improves the comfort and lets the trousers stretch depending on the users movement.Happily your gusseted crotch will keep your important parts safe, so will the YKK zip fly. The included button and Velcro adjustment is neat.Like most modern trousers, the front pockets have strengthened lips and give you easy access to the contents. Back pockets are simple, quite big and allow you to close them with Velcro flaps.I really liked the deep cargo pockets with inner felt-lined compartments. For me they were perfect for storing 2 magazines in each pocket for a pretty slick undercover look.Another neat feature is the possibility to add knee pads, as the reinforced knee part features a Velcro pocket. Obviously the knee pads are not included but there\u2019s plenty of them to pick from in the market. Like most of the trousers the bottoms could be tied for better fit.The pants we comfortable to wear. Event without a belt they stayed where they were supposed to and the elastic back worked great, improving the movement. The solid front Velcro flap and button were a good design choice.SummaryGreat products at a great price. I\u2019m becoming a big fan of the new line of clothing that Viper releases, especially given the price point. Can\u2019t wait to see what new products they will come up with!The GoodGood qualityNice fitComfortableLow priceThe BadThe trousers Ripstop material in the Titanium grey is a bit shiny compared to the jacketOriginally published on TacticalTwo", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Tactical", "Airsoft", "Milsim"]}, {"title": "VyprMedia", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@jenniferpeake438/vyprmedia-7f72aa2af238?source=search_post", "author_name": "VyprMedia", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@jenniferpeake438", "publish_date": "2017-12-11", "last_modified_date": "2019-03-04", "readtime": "0.37", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "VyprMediaVyprMediaFollowDec 11, 2017 \u00b7 1 min readWe\u2019re an ROI-focused digital marketing agency that changes the way our clients do business by creating new opportunities to boost profits.VyprMedia4776 N French Rd, East Amherst, NY 14051(855) 423\u20138977http://vyprmedia.comFacebookTwitterInstagram PinterestAbout.meTumblrYouTubeVimeoGoogle MapsTED", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Ako sme klientovi jedin\u00fdm linkom v \u010dl\u00e1nku vypredali sklad za 24 hod\u00edn", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@robert.sedlak/ako-sme-klientovi-jedin%C3%BDm-linkom-v-%C4%8Dl%C3%A1nku-vypredali-sklad-za-24-hod%C3%ADn-4b2502d8a07?source=search_post", "author_name": "R\u00f3bert Sedl\u00e1k", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@robert.sedlak", "publish_date": "2017-03-06", "last_modified_date": "2018-01-17", "readtime": "2.09", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Ako sme klientovi jedin\u00fdm linkom v \u010dl\u00e1nku vypredali sklad za 24 hod\u00ednR\u00f3bert Sedl\u00e1kFollowMar 6, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readMil\u00ed priatelia,tento v\u00edkend sa n\u00e1m podarila vec, o ktor\u00fa sa s Vami mus\u00edm podeli\u0165.Na serveri Dobr\u00e9 noviny sa sna\u017e\u00edme prin\u00e1\u0161a\u0165 pekn\u00e9 \u010dl\u00e1nky o be\u017en\u00fdch \u013eu\u010foch a firm\u00e1ch o kolo n\u00e1s, ktor\u00e9 robia svet lep\u0161\u00edm miestom.

And no, I\u2019m not going to apologize. I can\u2019t just sit by and be silent. My focus isn\u2019t even on the politicians. If you know me at all, you\u2019ll know that I don\u2019t put much faith in politicians, political parties, or ideology. I find most of them to be worthless and primarily interested in power. All of them are seriously flawed and frankly, I expect them to worship their idols of power, influence, money, and their other gods that they create in their own image. I hope this post is extremely uncomfortable. I hope it is inconvenient. I hope this because it sucked writing this. The focus of this post is on the Christians who read this.Jesus said:\u2018Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree bad, and its fruit bad; for the tree is known by its fruit. You brood of vipers! How can you speak good things, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. The good person brings good things out of a good treasure, and the evil person brings evil things out of an evil treasure. I tell you, on the day of judgement you will have to give an account for every careless word you utter; for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.\u2019(Matthew 12:33\u201337)I can think of no better passage of Scripture that applies to the filthy state of partisan politics today than this passage spoken by Jesus.Yesterday I received an e-mail with a link to an article by Jeff Roe on why Republicans would be mistaken to abandon Trump in the mid-term elections. Persona and policy can get mixed up. The GOP should celebrate the policies and not the distraction of the persona \u2014 that\u2019s the argument anyway. The essential argument is this \u2014 the ends justify the means.Yesterday as I was driving around I flipped through radio stations. Occasionally I flip over to talk radio to hear what the chattering is about. I can usually handle about five minutes worth before having to turn the station. Yesterday I heard the host in his usual blind allegiance of the president and the actions to cover up his affair with a porn star. The ends justified the means apparently. Don\u2019t you know, it was the porn star in the wrong.Today I saw Rudy Giuliani\u2019s interview on Sean Hannity\u2019s show. During this interview, Giuliani contradicts statements Trump made about knowing there was a payoff and where the money for the payoff came from. When the ends justify the means, who cares what was said before.Yesterday was the so-called National Day of Prayer. People gathered and there was an official prayer stated. The prayer is eloquent and hits on some very good points \u2014 turning from sin, unity of the body of Christ, turning from evil, forgiveness, reconciliation, healing, etc. All things that I can get behind, but the problem is that I\u2019m not sure if all Christians agree with the definitions of these terms.I\u2019m not sure that I have the same definition of unity as our \u201cChristian\u201d politicians and those that support their policies that do more harm than good, that uphold Social Darwinism (where only the strong survive), and where the end justifies the means is the foundation of life.I\u2019m not sure I have the same definition of turning from evil as our \u201cChristian\u201d politicians and those that support their actions by making excuses for behaviors that are unacceptable for you or I, but seem to be just fine because it was two consenting adults, don\u2019t you know. Yet these same people threw a hissy fit when another president screwed around with someone in the White House \u2014 which was just as terrible. But hey, when you believe that it\u2019s a Christian virtue to lay the foundation of your life at the altar of the ends justify the means, then anything goes, right?Does turning from evil mean that it\u2019s ok to knowingly lie and defend those lies because the truth is inconvenient and is costly? Does turning from evil mean that you pay hush money for an affair or that you defend someone who does this? Does turning from evil mean that you use your Christian label as a pastor to make excuses for a worldly powerful person. I thought we were called to deny ourselves, pick up our cross, and follow Jesus if we claimed the label of Christian.I\u2019m not sure I have the same understanding of the following line of prayer as our \u201cChristian\u201d politicians and those that support their rhetoric:We pray for all people of all ethnicities and races in America to come together as one, living in peace and unity together.I\u2019m not sure how anyone can claim to be a Christian and make excuses for a \u201cChristian\u201d politician who offers support to neo-nazis, labels all Mexicans as rapists and murders, who disparages numerous other groups of people. I\u2019m not twisting words here, go back and see what was actually said. If you feel the need to defend these words that he said, why? Why would you defend such vile language from anyone? Would you defend the same exact words, spoken in the same exact tone if they came from a politician that you didn\u2019t like? Or do the ends justify the means?I\u2019m not sure I have the same understanding of the following line of prayer as our \u201cChristian\u201d politicians and those that support their policy actions:We pray for God\u2019s power to unify families, workplaces, communities, and cities in America. By Your Spirit, lead us to forgiveness, reconciliation, healing, and unity.I find it hard to say we are all seeking to unify families and communities when we put up more roadblocks to the homeless and poor. We have families who are living in their vehicles at truck stops. And they are working, but don\u2019t make enough to find adequate housing. Men, women, and children living in their vehicles. And the typical response is something along these lines \u2014 well, they should work harder. Well, they should have not made so many bad decisions. Well, they get what they deserve. Well, if they only did this or that. Well, the churches can take care of them.BS.As a pastor who does ministry with the homeless, I can tell you that churches are not equipped to do this. We don\u2019t have the resources, the training, or the people to do this. We can do small things, but we don\u2019t have unlimited resources. We aren\u2019t trained in how to deal with mental illness. We aren\u2019t taught what to do when we run out of money trying to help someone and they end up back on the street again because all the shelters are full and they have nowhere to turn.If your response is \u201cwell, you should open your own doors then,\u201d or some other snide remark, then you are missing the whole point here.Jesus never said the ends justify the means. That\u2019s about as far away from what it means to be a Christian as you can get. If that is your belief of what it means to be a Christian \u2014 then you and I can\u2019t be unified because we don\u2019t have the same foundation.Is the defense of something and someone who is indefensible worth it?Or as Jesus said:Then Jesus told his disciples, \u2018If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it. For what will it profit them if they gain the whole world but forfeit their life? Or what will they give in return for their life?(Matthew 16:24\u201326)You want to get mad at me \u2014 go for it. I\u2019ve got thick skin. Frankly, I\u2019m not too happy with you either. And I refuse to shut up because I\u2019m pointing out something uncomfortable and inconvenient. Your comfort is not my concern. Especially when we have people who are homeless, people who haven\u2019t had a meal on a plate since August, people who have families that are living in vehicles, people who are being trafficked on our interstates, people who are treated as second class citizens because of their skin color or orientation. If that\u2019s uncomfortable, then it should be. Being a Christian is not comfortable or convenient. It\u2019s not suppose to be. It\u2019s supposed to smack us in the face and make us so uncomfortable and inconvenienced that we respond to the injustice we see around us.Frankly, I\u2019m tired of Christians who want the label, but refuse to live out the calling. I\u2019m tired of Christians who value their loyalty to a politician or party (any politician in either party \u2014 yes, this applies to Democrats just as much as Republicans) above Jesus. I\u2019m tired of Christians making excuses for \u201cbad trees,\u201d as Jesus called them, all because they believe that the ends justify the means when it comes to policies.We are called to live out what Jesus commands us to do, not to have blind loyalty to some politician who is temporarily in power.Pick up your cross and follow Jesus. Jesus didn\u2019t say, pick up your tweet and follow Trump. Jesus didn\u2019t say, pick up your sign and follow some other candidate. Jesus didn\u2019t say send in a check and blindly follow your party.These are difficult times in our nation. The call for unity is something that is needed. However, it is not possible to have unity where there is a strongly held belief that not everyone is equal in value and worth. How can there be unity when there are some who create us vs. them situations, where the poor are seen as an expense, where we have leaders who firmly believe that only the strong should survive, where we value things over people, etc.But not all is hopeless or lost. Last night I heard something that hit me. I don\u2019t remember the exact words, but here\u2019s what I heard \u2014 when everything has been exhausted, there is grace.Even in this situation, there is grace. It\u2019s the only thing that can carry us forward. We humans can\u2019t fix this ourselves \u2014 we are too devoted to our divisions and separations. We have blind worship of our leaders and ideologies. We cling to our sin and brokenness.Only God can fix this. And it may require something else \u2014 something that is deeply associated with being a follower of Christ. It will require death. Death of our egos. Death of our loyalties. Death of our certainties and answers. Death of our attitudes towards one another. Death of excuses. Death of our sin and brokenness.Only then will we experience the fullness of being a Christ follower \u2014 resurrection. New life, renewed life, restored life, transformed life.This is my hope. This is my prayer. It\u2019s time to start acting out what we claim to believe. It\u2019s time to start actually being Christians, not just taking on the label. If we don\u2019t, we\u2019re no better than the people who Jesus called out as a brood of vipers.Originally published at laceduplutheran.com on May 4, 2018.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Christianity", "Politics"]}, {"title": "Viper Arctic Ice 7-Foot Air Hockey Game Table Review", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@MadisonPolansk_40124/viper-arctic-ice-7-foot-air-hockey-game-table-review-3d06b03a3ab5?source=search_post", "author_name": "Madison Polansky", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@MadisonPolansk_40124", "publish_date": "2017-05-25", "last_modified_date": "2017-05-30", "readtime": "4.88", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Viper Arctic Ice 7-Foot Air Hockey Game Table ReviewMadison PolanskyFollowMay 25, 2017 \u00b7 5 min readIn my quest to look for a nice and sturdy hockey table for my family, the Viper Arctic Ice 7-Foot clearly stood out; I decided to give it a try. Upon arrival (damage free), I was able to put it together in a little under three hours, with help from my 14-yr-old son.Being a heavy table, I took precautions to ensure safe handling. The design is seemingly larger, giving you more room to send the pluck flying! For a true arcade feeling, the table came equipped with magnificent lighting and built-in sound.Powered by 110 cubic feet per minute motor, your pluck glides smoothly across the table as the electronic scoreboard keeps track of the progress.Feature of the Viper Arctic Ice 7-Foot Air Hockey Game TableThe following are the features that you should know:>>> Click Here to See More Photos Now on Amazon! <<<AestheticsAt 222.7 pounds, the Viper Arctic Ice 7-Foot Air Hockey Game Table has a large cabinet supported by big legs. This design ensures its longevity, stability, and durability. Besides evoking a manly appeal, the size and heavyset design will fit perfectly in your man cave too.For a more arcade feel, turning off the table\u2019s lights lets you fully enjoy Arctic Ice aesthetics. By highlighting the LED lights and allowing them to stand out, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re right at the center of the action in an ultra-modern hockey arcade!As a visually appealing table, Viper Arctic Ice 7-Foot is designed to capture your attention while still giving you a tough challenge. Though the latest features built into it make it appear a bit chunky, it is among the easiest hockey tables to work with.Smoothly Styled Playing SurfaceTo help with the even flow, this Viper Arctic hockey table has an ultra-smooth, ultra-sleek playing surface. With the high-speed white playing surface offering me continuous play, the pace never seemed to slow down. If you reminisce of the old arcade style, you\u2019ll love the top of this air hockey table. The attractive and sleek look has a retro feel hint, making it fit across all ages. You can now enjoy action-packed arcade fun with high-speed play.For each game action, the light along the table\u2019s rail light up in different patterns and colors, making the game all-the-more interactive.Perfect AirflowTo make sure your games are fair and engaging, Arctic Ice 7-Foot provides enough air flow on its surface. As one of the most important components of a good air hockey table, incredible airflow keeps the game seamless and fluid.The powerful blower effortlessly guides your pucks across the surface, making the table remarkably interactive. With the player dictating the speed and intensity of airflow, the game can get as exciting as you wish!All the while, the game kept up with all my movements; one can play for hours on end without the slightest hint of boredom creeping in. Some tables have poof airflow, sucking the fun right off the game; Viper Arctic Ice is designed to deliver maximum user satisfaction.Arcade Style FeaturesViper Arctic Ice style is simply lovable! At a first glance, it looks and feels like a high-end arcade (which it is). This feel is brought right to your home, complementing whichever environment you place the table in. With the air hockey table at home, I no longer have to spend quarters just to have a good time with my family and friends. This table uses the latest Lumen-X technology in its lighting, masking your every move in a beautiful combination of colors.I particularly liked the fast playing in-game music; it kept me focused and excited enough in every action-packed game. Just like true arcade-style tables, you will hardly mess up your turn with this one.DurabilityAs a heavy-built table, the Viper Arctic Ice 7-Foot requires two adults to move, and extreme care when assembling. While moving may seem like a disadvantage, it instead offers you a huge benefit. At 222.7 pounds, the table won\u2019t rock even during the most aggressive sessions.Being stable and sturdy, this table can withstand a fair amount of wear and tear. Playing air hockey requires a lot of leaning especially when out to score goals; a light and loosely built table would start coming apart pretty soon.To further add to its durability, this stable has large, sturdy legs, distributing its weight evenly while keeping it balanced. This stability gives me room to play better with minimal distractions.Scoring SystemAs a gamer, you acknowledge that each highly competitive game requires a sharp scorekeeper. The Arctic Ice 7-Foot Air Hockey Game Table comes with a fully electronic scoring system, keeping an accurate record of all player actions.Through it, you can view the score without taking your eyes off the game. Manually changing scores would not only waste your time but also distract you from the task at hand. The table sets the record straight, avoiding minor \u2018disputes\u2019 over the score.Every time a player scores a point, the clearly marked, easy to read numbers update. At the end, all players are satisfied of the accurate tally. With no guess work involved, there\u2019s no limit to how much fun you can have!Spacious and Wide TableMeasuring 84\" by 48\", Viper Arctic Ice 7-Foot is spacious enough and didn\u2019t take up too much of my gaming room. Its composition and huge, sturdy legs balance it out automatically, making your play as comfortable as possible.The sharp and nice retro shape makes the table uniquely attractive, adding to incredible game play.Viper Arctic Ice 7-Foot Air Hockey Game Table \u2014 VideoSmooth surface.Excellent size.Lumen-X Technology.Retro-arcade gaming style setup.Gaming accessories included in the package.Perfect air flow amount.Quite pricey, but worth every pennyLED ScorerRinkDual End Puck ReturnsPlay PackageDimensions: 84\" L x 48\" W x 32\" HWeight: 211 poundsShipping Weight: 222.7 poundsModel number: 64\u20133006Frequently Asked QuestionsA: No; the electronic scoreboard has been screwed on the table top. If you haven\u2019t screwed the scoreboard on though, it is possible.A: Yes; if you wish to, you can turn off the lights to be \u2018only noticeable\u2019 at night.

In terms of gameplay and aesthetics, this air hockey game table stands out from its peers.Offering you and your family an escape from smartphones, tablets, and all other electronic devices, this table offers you a way to spend quality time with your family and friends.

The ore was then worked by skilled craftsmen, who also used it to forge the famous swords of Belluno, the town where I was born and still work.Under the symbol N.V.N.D. \u201cNuovo Viperaio Nelle Dolomiti\u201d (New Viper Blacksmith of the Dolomites), I rapidly became the undisputed leader in the creation and installation of wrought iron vipers throughout the Dolomites, which are, amongst other things, famous for the presence of these magical animals in the midst of its cathedrals of rock.In 2015, thanks to my encounter with MEDDLE, I decided to spread this ancient and characteristic art outside the boundaries outlined by these mountains, unique world-over.VIPERAThe Dolomites are the backdrop and natural setting that inspired and nourished this artistic project. VIPERS, the mysterious creatures that inhabit these places, are a presence known to man, who has established a difficult coexistence with them, often dominated by ancestral impulses of fear and admiration.Mario Padovani shaping VIPERAMario Padovani has succeeded in his intent to arouse the same dualistic and contrasting feeling through his sculpture in wrought iron.The brute and inert material is skilfully forged and modelled by the physicality of the work processes, guided by the energy lent by its creator: noise, flames, sparks and steam accompany the process, almost intimidating us to keep away for the sake of our safety.In contrast with these intrusive and dominating forces, the delicacy of the artist\u2019s etching has been specially designed to decorate each unique piece.This is the most silent and introverted phase, which guides us almost to a dimension of fascination and admiration: the previous distances dissolve in favour of close contemplation.This is a medieval technique once used primarily for decorating weapons and armour, which owes its name to the ancient \u201caqua fortis\u201d, the nitric acid that alchemists discovered in approximately 700 A.D.The method uses the properties of bees wax to resist the corrosive power of the acids that, instead, attack the metal.The piece being decorated was dipped into melted beeswax that covered it evenly; this layer was then carved, revealing the metal parts that would subsequently be corroded in the acid bath.Throughout history, this technique has been used as a final touch to the finished piece; in the case of VIPERA, however, it is used as an unprecedented variation of the classical technique; the piece is re-forged and modelled after the corrosion process, thus plastically deforming the pattern obtained with the etching and creating an original and unique effect.VIPERA \u2014 available exclusively at www.studiomeddle.com \u2014 An original video documented the etching and crafting process.The artistic result of VIPERA leads us to experiencing an inner process of interaction with the artefact once it is displayed. The desire to share the experience makes the artwork take on different interpretations, stimulating a spectrum of meanings that each elaborates in their own personal way.VIPERA \u2014 available exclusively at www.studiomeddle.comVIPERA \u2014 available exclusively at www.studiomeddle.comVIPERA \u2014 available exclusively at www.studiomeddle.comVIPERA \u2014 available exclusively at www.studiomeddle.comAbout MEDDLE:At MEDDLE we bring together people with meaningful stories to tell and ask them to share what they believe in, in order to attract other like-minded individuals.Get inspired and support stories worth sharing.www.studiomeddle.com", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Design", "Crafting", "Artist", "Art"]}, {"title": "The Seen & Unseen Forces: Waves", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vynermano/the-seen-unseen-forces-waves-8ab5d294766e?source=search_post", "author_name": "Vyner Mano", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vynermano", "publish_date": "2019-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-01", "readtime": "5.34", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "The Seen & Unseen Forces: WavesVyner ManoFollowFeb 15 \u00b7 6 min readWaves can be felt. Waves can be seen. Waves can be pulled. Waves can push. Waves can manipulate time. Such are the strengths of waves and it is not even the strongest forces known to men.Waves that can be felt for example are electromagnetic waves, where it can heat up the meat that you are cooking in the oven. Waves can be \u2018seen\u2019 with the projection of sound waves like how bats do at night and how they hear the echoes back to navigate through the night. There is also hope for the blind to \u2018see\u2019 through the projection of echoes and acoustic way-finding.Waves basically are sinusoidal graphs that have amplitudes and frequencies. By adjusting the frequencies and amplitudes, one can make an imaging to see something beyond their capability. For example, the MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) or X-ray uses the wave to see what is inside our body. Even the search for oil and gas, as well as objects in the sea, can be done by sonar imaging that involved transmission and receiving of the waves.Waves can pull you and push you, like the waves in the ocean where the tides are coming and going away from the shore. The wind in the air transfer its energy into the seawater and producing waves that you can see and at a bigger scale, surf on it. Waves are also caused by the gravitational pull between the moon and the Earth.The universe or on a smaller scale, the planets in the solar system are bound by the gravitational pull and orbiting around the powerful star that of the sun. Some of the stars, for example, the sun in our solar system, is so big that it curved the fabric of the space and caused the nearby planets to orbit around the sun. Some of the stars in the outer galaxy may have combined with each other and caused an explosion resulting in a blackhole that is so massive that it causes a ripple in the fabric of the space that we called a gravitational wave. In other words, we can say that there is energy across the universe and it is movable from one distant place to another.Why is a gravitational wave is a big deal? Human has always wanted to do time travelling and one of the keys to making time travel possible is by having the energy at a certain area to be disrupted so big that it causes the gravity to be disturbed- like throwing a big ball into a calm clear water, and the energy in the ball will cause the ball to dive into the water and causes the surface around it to bend and curve towards the ball. The ripples move shows that energy can also move across space and time in the universe. Let say we are at one spot in the water, we will always be in that spot unless there is a disruption. The only way for us to move from one area to another area of the water is through ripples, that ripples represent us travelling through space and time- only possible if there is massive energy produced to create the ripples.So far in this chapter, we have been discussing waves. Why waves and what is it going to do with the faith in God? Waves are something that is so much involved in our life, we cannot at once run away from the wave. All the lights that we see and could not see are the electromagnetic wave.In the 21st century, our lives are governed and revolve around radio waves that we called wireless internet. So much information can be shared across the globe and continents in real time. Such is the greatness of wave that we can know things happening in a place so far away from us and beyond our human normal capabilities.There is a technology that 21st-century mankind has mastered that has revolutionised how information gets across. It is called the internet. The internet is such a powerful wireless technology that can allow activities to be done in a very huge distance in a very short time. An event or showcase can be broadcasted live and in real time is readily available to the masses thanks to these wireless internet technologies and capabilities.With the internet, transactions and business can be performed at a very high speed and whatever being performed in one side of the world can be completed on the other side of the world. This is possible due to the propagation of waves and how the information and instruction are able to be transmitted over a long distance from one location to another location.There is even the term \u2018Internet of Things\u2019 or IoT. This is a concept where everything from simple devices to heavy machinery is able to be connected to the internet and instructions can be transmitted and received to perform jobs. More and more technology is becoming smart and is able to be connected to the internet.In the 21st century, anything that has internet capabilities or smartphone is the device or machine that received high demands for having high functionality. In the age of \u2018Internet of Things\u2019, it is expected for all the devices and machines to be able to be connected to the internet. This means all of the machines and devices are able to communicate or to be controlled from a distance depending on how the machine was programmed to function.The internet can give a good analogy on how prayers and intervention work. When a person is praying, it is analogous to one starts connecting to the internet. When the person is connected, the desired input will be given, such as sending emails or just opening entertainment videos. When the input has been recorded, the information will be sent across to its desired destination. Divine intervention is like the response to the input. The response could be another email to answer the earlier email, or the videos are being chosen in the library to be displayed to the requester.Another example of how the internet can change things is the example of smartphones. Smartphones\u2019 operating system usually has to go through updates in order to receive new features and better performance, it can be done by connecting to the internet and receive updates from the developer.This is similar to the concept of praying and faith, one can be upgraded and be blessed with good things in life, but the person still has to work for it. One should connect the phone to an internet connection, go through the updates, look through the risk and terms of the new updates, and finally request for the update. The rest is the trust that the update will go smoothly and there will be no bug in the new operating system version.At the same time, one has to work on their storage in times where the update really messed up their phones and memory. One cannot be complacent that the updates will always be good and there will be no hiccups.Because with any hiccups and bumps, the person might succumb to the need to look for somebody to blame for. As much as one should pray as if everything is depended on the higher being, one has to work as much as if everything is depended on man.Excerpted with permission from \u2018The Science of Faith\u2019, where the concept of faith and God is explained via existing famous scientific theories and knowledge.Copyright \u00a9 2019 by Vyner Mano.

We are an operations and logistics company that begins with sending out invites for client\u2019s events and compiling their guest list. On site, we run all points of entrance. Our team of VIPER girls handles the entire check in process from guest entrance to talent pulls to VIP escorting. We also offer brand ambassadors and cocktail servers to meet all needs of an event or venue.What was the idea behind creating the company? Did you have any prior experience that helped you get here?A few years ago, I started working for Bolthouse Productions as an intern. I thought I wanted to do event production, but realized I actually hated it. I met Kelsi working at Bolthouse and we both somehow ended up being the go-to people to handle guest check in at events. However we would always be thrown into it super last minute. After one crazy event at the end of 2015, we decided we would start a small company to handle just that aspect of the event on our own. It was supposed to be a small thing, but ended up expanding way bigger than we ever imagined.What clients have you worked with?We are super fortunate to have an incredible clientele list, including but not limited to: Jimmy Kimmel Live, H.Wood Group, TAO Group, Treats! Magazine, Heineken, Team Epiphany, Redbull, Billboard, Weinstein, Parkwood Entertainment, and more.Front of house at one of VIPER\u2019s eventsHow do you divide tasks between you and your co-founder?Although we work closely with one another, each of us has our own strengths that we bring to the table. Kelsi is definitely the creative. She handles all of our aesthetics and branding. I handle more of the logistics and client development side.What difficulties have you faced and continue to face along the journey with VIPER?We have built the entire company self- funded. In order to do that, Kelsi and I both took up an extra job in the beginning. Although we do not have any debt, it can be difficult not having investors because we are doing everything on our own. Additionally, as two young women working in a male dominated industry, getting people to take us seriously can be a challenge as well. Furthermore, since we are working as team, we have to remind ourselves that we are all here for the same reason.Lastly what advice would you give to others?Our best advice would be to not sell out. For example, we have been approached with so many offers asking us to do things that are not in line with VIPER\u2019s platform, and therefore have had to decline clients.

Switch to it soon and watch your health improve for good.VapingA lot has been told about the ill-effects of tobacco cigarettes, but the urge to get that quick puff after a meal or probably in between work stress doesn\u2019t seem to diminish. While it is an addition, for some the release of smoke is all that is required.To compensate and replace tobacco cigarettes, there is an alternative called the e-cigarette. The concept of it is the moment you pull in from it; you take in vapour which is released from the mouth after the inhalation.These vapes are produced with the help of glycerine, and sometimes there are flavours added to it. Some like it with nicotine especially chain smokers who intend to get rid of their tobacco smoking habits.While the smoke from tobacco cigarettes aren\u2019t good for your body, it isn\u2019t healthy for those living around you. Here is how you can improve your health when you switch to vaping.There is a reduction of chemical intakeWhen you smoke a tobacco cigarette, you take in multiple chemicals into your body which settles itself in the lungs, blood, skin, etc. One of the major chemicals is the Carbon Monoxide, which turns out to be fatal for the body. When you smoke an e-cigarette or a vape in Sydney, you tend to take in glycerine vapour infused with flavours simply. This replicates the smoke from a tobacco cigarette and thus making you feel healthy.Vaping affects psychologyWhen you vape, you are smoking in the same process. The e-cigarette replicates the tobacco one and also there is a light at the end of it which glows whenever you take a puff. This is a psychological effect that makes you prefer e-cigarette after a few days. Some burn cigarettes because they like the smoke that comes out of it. When you see similar or even more smoke, the urge of smoking the tobacco ones disappears.Your body starts to repair itselfWhen you stop smoking a cigarette, your body tends to start repairing itself from all the damage that it has encountered all this while. The body has a natural healing process, and during that course, you can satisfy your cigarette smoking craving with the help of e-cigarettes from a vape shop in Liverpool. It has a similar effect without having any counter effect on the body. You get the same feeling and thus allowing your body to heal simultaneously.Your family members feel healthy tooSecond-hand smoking is also similar to first-hand ones. Your family members are inhaling the smoke too, and their lungs are getting damaged in the process. While you had plans to reduce your longevity, they too wouldn\u2019t have survived for long. Therefore, when you make a switch from tobacco cigarettes to e-cigarettes, you are choosing both you and your family members.It is very difficult for an ardent smoker to get rid of their cigarettes the next day. Nicotine present in cigarettes is known to be addictive while creating this urge of smoking from time to time. When you have e-cigarettes replacing it, the urge is controlled while preventing any damage to the body.\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 -Author bio:- The author has had experiences with using vapes in Sydney and writes this article to help people know of the health benefits of vaping and buying them from vape shops in Liverpool.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Vaping", "Vape Shop"]}, {"title": "FOREST Is Calling For Vape Use Restrictions To Be Lifted At Hospitals", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vaperempire/forest-is-calling-for-vape-use-restrictions-to-be-lifted-at-hospitals-d58953bd0389?source=search_post", "author_name": "Vaper Empire", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vaperempire", "publish_date": "2019-04-30", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-30", "readtime": "0.66", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "FOREST Is Calling For Vape Use Restrictions To Be Lifted At HospitalsVaper EmpireFollowApr 30 \u00b7 1 min readShould vaping be allowed on hospital grounds?

My jsme ale st\u00e1le hledali tu hlavn\u00ed so\u0161ku vysm\u00e1t\u00e9ho Buddhy, kter\u00e1 byla vyobrazena i na vstupence. Cel\u00e9 davy se hrnuly sm\u011brem vzh\u016fru na vrchol skal, tak jsme si \u0159ekli, \u017ee se tam asi bude nach\u00e1zet jako odm\u011bna za v\u00fdstup. Po 30 minut\u00e1ch ne \u00fapln\u011b pohodov\u00e9ho v\u00fd\u0161lapu jsme se ocitli na vrcholu, kde nebylo krom\u011b st\u00e1nku s ob\u010derstven\u00edm, kter\u00fd tu p\u016fsobil jako p\u011bst na oko, a jednoho n\u00e1pisu v\u016fbec nic.

Hlavn\u011b jsme ale vid\u011bli j\u00eddlo p\u0159edem na vlastn\u00ed o\u010di, tak\u017ee jsme snad prvn\u011b v\u011bd\u011bli, co si d\u00e1v\u00e1me.Mas\u00e1\u017eA je to tady, nastal slavostn\u00ed okam\u017eik, o kter\u00e9m si budeme je\u0161t\u011b za 10 let vypr\u00e1v\u011bt. Za\u0161li jsme si s Martinou na \u010d\u00ednskou mas\u00e1\u017e do salonu Bona Caiba. Kdy\u017e jsme vlezli dovnit\u0159, divil jsem se, \u017ee je tam takov\u00e1 fronta a u\u017e jsem cht\u011bl j\u00edt pry\u010d. Pak m\u011b ale Martina upozornila, \u017ee to jsou v\u0161echno mas\u00e9rky a \u017ee tam vlastn\u011b nikdo jin\u00fd nen\u00ed. Rukama nohama jsme se domluvili, kde co a jak dlouho se bude mas\u00edrovat a \u0161lo se na v\u011bc.

Bohu\u017eel jsme jednak nena\u0161li \u017e\u00e1dnou p\u016fj\u010dovnu kol, nav\u00edc za\u010dalo i pr\u0161et. B\u011b\u017eeli jsme schovat pod st\u0159\u00ed\u0161ku pagodov\u00e9ho alt\u00e1nu, kde jsme sledovali m\u00edstn\u00edho kresl\u00ed\u0159e, jak zpodobil portr\u00e9t mal\u00e9 hol\u010di\u010dky. Docela mu to \u0161lo, py\u0161n\u00fd t\u00e1ta si od n\u011bho nakonec portr\u00e9t koupil. Pot\u00e9 u\u017e mal\u00ed\u0159e nikdo jin\u00fd neoslovil, tak on naopak oslovil Martinu, \u017ee chce nakreslit jej\u00ed evropsk\u00fd profil.

P\u0159i pohledu na v\u00fddejn\u00ed automaty jsme tak leda dostali chu\u0165 na \u010daj, napadlo n\u00e1s ale, \u017ee by na n\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed mohlo b\u00fdt je\u0161t\u011b dal\u0161\u00ed v\u00fddejn\u00ed ok\u00e9nko.

To u\u017e jsme za\u010dali trochu panika\u0159it a po\u010d\u00edtat, kolik by st\u00e1lo vz\u00edt si taxi. Po n\u011bkolika nul\u00e1ch jsme toho nechali a zoufale se za\u010dali pt\u00e1t lid\u00ed na potk\u00e1n\u00ed, co m\u00e1me d\u011blat. Person\u00e1l n\u011bkam m\u00e1vnul rukou a cosi za\u017evatlal, tak jsme tam rychle p\u0159ib\u011bhli a\u2026 na\u0161li jsme otev\u0159en\u00e9 v\u00fddejn\u00ed ok\u00e9nko. Heur\u00e9ka!L\u00edstky jsme tedy nakonec dostali, zpocen\u00e9 pono\u017eky jsme si vym\u011bnili. Dokonce jsme ve front\u011b potkali 2 \u010ce\u0161ky, jedna se n\u00e1s n\u011bco anglicky zeptala, my j\u00ed \u010desky odpov\u011bd\u011bli. To n\u011bjak vyignorovala a zeptala se n\u00e1s znovu anglicky. To m\u011b docela zm\u00e1tlo a za\u010dal jsem p\u0159em\u00fd\u0161let nad t\u00edm, jestli jsme j\u00ed skute\u010dn\u011b odpov\u011bd\u011bli \u010desky. Martina se ale zm\u00e1st nenechala, tak\u017ee jsme si nakonec i trochu pokecali. Holky ale sp\u011bchaly na vlak do \u0160angaje, tak hned utekly.Po nalod\u011bn\u00ed jsme za\u010dali Hard Seatu trochu litovat. Seda\u010dky jsou sice celkem velik\u00e9, ale nemaj\u00ed \u017e\u00e1dn\u00e1 op\u011br\u00e1tka ani na hlavu, ani na ruce. No\u010dn\u00ed cesta tak byla docela peklo a pr\u016fvod\u010d\u00ed, kter\u00fd ka\u017edou hodinu vy\u0159v\u00e1val, jestli n\u011bkdo nechce nudle, byl Lucifer.Hong Kong podruh\u00e9Po p\u0159ekon\u00e1n\u00ed hrani\u010dn\u00edho p\u0159echodu Futian/Lok Ma Chau jsme se ihned vydali na ostrov Lantau (metrem na Tung Chung Station), odkud se d\u00e1 dostat k nad\u017eivotn\u00edmu Buddhovi. Martina neust\u00e1le posp\u00edchala, skoro a\u017e sprintovala k \u00falo\u017en\u00fdm sk\u0159\u00ed\u0148k\u00e1m v m\u00edstn\u00edm obchodn\u00edm centru, kam jsme se cht\u011bli d\u00e1t batohy. Z toho jsem byl docela otr\u00e1venej (Martina zas byl otr\u00e1ven\u00e1 z toho, jak jsem byl otr\u00e1venej), kdy\u017e jsme tam ale p\u0159il\u00edtli, u\u017e jich tam na n\u00e1s moc nezb\u00fdvalo, nav\u00edc hned za n\u00e1mi p\u0159ib\u011bhli dal\u0161\u00ed turisti.Po odhozen\u00ed batoh\u016f jsme se hned vydali na bus \u010d. 23, kter\u00fd jezd\u00ed a\u017e k Buddhovi. Cena m\u011bla pro oba b\u00fdt 19 HKD, nakonec jsme ale platili 58 (v\u010detn\u011b v\u00edkendov\u00e9ho p\u0159\u00edplatku). Plat\u00ed se samoz\u0159ejm\u011b cash a v\u00fdb\u011br\u010d\u00ed nevrac\u00ed, tak jsme si za\u0161li je\u0161t\u011b do Starbucksu rozm\u011bnit.

Ze zoufalstv\u00ed jsme se za\u0161li pod\u00edvat i kolik stoj\u00ed lanovka, kde byla fronta jen 198 m. U\u017e nev\u00edm kolik to bylo, ale vzpom\u00edn\u00e1m si, \u017ee bylo levn\u011bj\u0161\u00ed si koupit scooter a dojet tam na n\u011bm. Rezignovan\u011b jsme tedy vyst\u00e1li frontu na bus.Naho\u0159e jsme nechali Buddhu Buddhou a \u0161li jsme se nejd\u0159\u00edv naj\u00edst do m\u00edstn\u00ed vegetari\u00e1nsk\u00e9 restaurace, kter\u00e1 je sou\u010d\u00e1st\u00ed Po Lin Monastery. Jednalo se o docela drahou masovku pro turisty, ale nic jin\u00e9ho jsme v okol\u00ed nena\u0161li. Pot\u00e9, co se Martina najedla (a j\u00e1 jen smutn\u011b koukal na v\u0161echnu tu zeleninu), jsme se plni energie kone\u010dn\u011b vydali na v\u00fd\u0161lap k Buddhovi. V tom vedru a tla\u010dence s ostatn\u00edmi to byl celkem z\u00e1\u017eitek, v\u00fdstup je to ale hodn\u011b kr\u00e1tk\u00fd, tak\u017ee jsme kupodivu propotili jen 1 tri\u010dko. P\u0159\u00edmo uvnit\u0159 ob\u0159\u00ed sochy je i nezaj\u00edmav\u00e9 muzeum, zaj\u00edmav\u00e9 jsou jen okoln\u00ed sochy a samoz\u0159ejm\u011b v\u00fdhled.S Buddhou jsme se rozlou\u010dili a vydali se u\u017e sm\u011brem na leti\u0161t\u011b, kter\u00e9 je hned na vedlej\u0161\u00edm ostrov\u011b a jezd\u00ed tam levn\u00fd bus S1. Odlet prob\u011bhl bez probl\u00e9m\u016f, ve \u0160v\u00fdcarsku jsme m\u011bli 6 hodinov\u00fd p\u0159estup, tak jsme se tam alespo\u0148 vysprchovali (sprchy maj\u00ed minim\u00e1ln\u011b 3) a dali si Lindt horkou \u010dokol\u00e1du. P\u016fvodn\u011b jsme se cht\u011bli je\u0161t\u011b pod\u00edvat do centra Curychu, u\u017e jsme ale byli tak unaven\u00ed, \u017ee jsme se jen vykempili na leti\u0161ti.A to je v\u0161eA to je v\u0161e, p\u0159\u00e1tel\u00e9. Takhle jsme poznali malou \u010d\u00e1st \u010c\u00ednsk\u00e9 Lidov\u00e9 Republiky. Spoustu jsme toho nestihli, ale ani jsme ne\u010dekali, \u017ee b\u011bhem jedn\u00e9 cesty pozn\u00e1me celou \u010c\u00ednu. Rozhod\u011b se do n\u00ed chceme je\u0161t\u011b v budoucnu vr\u00e1tit a pod\u00edvat se i do Tibetu (p\u0161\u0161\u0161t!) a do dal\u0161\u00edch oblast\u00ed.Co n\u00e1s s Martinou oba hodn\u011b p\u0159ekvapilo, bylo, jak moc se n\u00e1m l\u00edbil venkov oproti m\u011bst\u016fm. Ne \u017ee by m\u011bsta byla n\u011bjak nehostinn\u00e1, ale pokud jsme m\u011bli srovnat t\u0159eba Xi\u2019An a Yangshuo, tak je v\u00edt\u011bz jasn\u00fd. Viva Yangshuo!!!Rozhodn\u011b se n\u00e1m vyplatilo dlouhodob\u00e9 pl\u00e1nov\u00e1n\u00ed cel\u00e9 cesty p\u0159edem, d\u00edky \u010demu\u017e se d\u00e1 i hodn\u011b u\u0161et\u0159it.

Kartou se v\u011bt\u0161inou platit ned\u00e1, ale jde si vybrat \u010deskou kartou z bankomat\u016f Bank of China.

Na letmou komunikaci s m\u00edstn\u00edmi jsme pou\u017e\u00edvali Microsoft Translator, u n\u011bho byla pouze \u0161koda, \u017ee neum\u00ed rozpozn\u00e1n\u00ed hlasu a \u010dten\u00ed textu v offline re\u017eimu.A co m\u00edstn\u00ed?

Tato pevnost v historick\u00e9m centru Mil\u00e1na je v\u00fdjime\u010dn\u00e1 svou velkou rozlohou. Uvnit\u0159 byla spousta muze\u00ed.

Mapa n\u00e1s zavedla do dvora, kde posed\u00e1vali mlad\u00ed lid\u00e9 trochu alternativn\u00edho vzhledu a v\u0161ude se vzn\u00e1\u0161el d\u00fdm marihuany. A\u010dkoliv jsme si zprvu nebyli jist\u00ed, kam jsme to zalezli, byli jsme spr\u00e1vn\u011b. Dv\u016fr krom\u011b galerie um\u011bn\u00ed hostil taky um\u011bleckou univerzitu.Vstupn\u00e9 do galerie um\u011bn\u00ed bylo ale p\u011bkn\u011b drah\u00e9.

Po p\u016fl hodin\u011b nah\u00e1n\u011bn\u00ed jsme se se\u0161li v Sempione parku, kde u\u017e jsme to znali, a proj\u00ed\u017ed\u011bli jsme se po n\u011bm. Po cyklostezk\u00e1ch, kter\u00fdch tu bylo hojn\u011b, jsme dojeli a\u017e k Arco della Pace.Na prostranstv\u00ed kolem v\u00edt\u011bzn\u00e9ho oblouku cvi\u010dilo do rytmu muziky asi dv\u011b st\u011b sportovc\u016f. My jsme je chvilku pozorovali, jak byli sesynchronizovan\u00ed. Pak jsme se vyfotili s monumentem a rozhodli se na kolech dojet a\u017e dom\u016f. \u0158eknu v\u00e1m, byl to ale n\u00e1pad! Jeli jsme asi hodinu. Ob\u010das pohodln\u011b po cyklostezce, ob\u010das nebezpe\u010dn\u011b na kraji dvouproud\u00e9 silnice.

However with many people sharing the same service, I found them slow, unreliable and would often take forever to connect.In this article I\u2019ll explain how I managed to setup my own personal VPN for free! You too should be able to set it up in the time it takes me to watch this 10 minute YouTube cat video (in HD on my personal VPN, thank you).To get the free VPN I\u2019m making use of a promotion through Alibaba Cloud. But before you start there are 3 things you\u2019ll need:A non-Chinese phone number (to get a text sent through to register)A non-Chinese card (or a Paypal account should also be fine)Be willing to get your hands dirty on the technical side (but I\u2019ll do my best to walk you through it!)It\u2019ll all be worth it when you\u2019re streaming cat videos in HD \u2014 let\u2019s start!Step 1 \u2014 registerGo to AlibabaCloud.com and follow the instructions to sign up for a free account. After you\u2019ve verified a payment method you\u2019ll get $300 free credit which we\u2019ll use to setup the VPN.Step 2 \u2014 setup an Elastic Compute ServiceElastic Compute Service?

We\u2019ll be controlling it remotely from your own computer.Go to the Alibaba Cloud Free Credit page and under \u201cElastic Computer Service\u201d click \u201cTry it now\u201d. This takes you to a page to configure it.60 days and 530 GB, all free!Most of this we don\u2019t need to change and you can ignore, apart from the following:Under \u201cChoose the Datacenter Region and Zone\u201d, we can choose where our VPN is going to be. It\u2019s up to you \u2014 I chose Hong Kong as it\u2019s close to Mainland China but its internet is unrestricted. Note generally the closer the place the faster the speeds you\u2019ll get.In \u201cChoose Network Type\u201d, under \u201cNetwork Type\u201d just click the dropdown and choose the defaults here.Just below that is \u201cSecurity Group\u201d. This is slightly more involved \u2014 we\u2019re going to open a port just for our VPN to use.- Click \u201cSelect security group\u201d- Click \u201cShow group rules\u201d which will take you to a new page- On this page click the button \u201cAdd Security Group Rules\u201d at the top- Leave most settings as they are. But under \u201cPort Range\u201d type \u201c8000/8000\u201d and under \u201cAuthorization Object\u201d type \u201c0.0.0.0/0\u201d.- Click \u201cOK\u201d and you can close this page!- On our previous page we can just choose the group we just modified. Basically click on the one with the name that looks like your cat just walked all over your keyboard.Under \u201cSecurity Setting\u201d select \u201cSet Password\u201d and, well, set a password. Don\u2019t forget it! \u2014 we\u2019ll need this so you and only you can log into your remote computer you\u2019re setting up.Click \u201cBuy Now\u201d. You\u2019ll be taken to the confirmation page. At the bottom you should see the beautiful \u201cPrice\uff1a $ 0.00 USD\u201d \u2014 if you don\u2019t, it means you haven\u2019t activated your free credit. Note it\u2019s free for now, but when the credit runs out in 60 days you\u2019ll start being charged, so make sure you check up on that. Go ahead and complete your order!It\u2019s beautifulStep 3 \u2014 log in to our remote computerThis is the cool part, where we\u2019ll control our remote computer right from where you are. Go to your ECS Console after logging in, click on \u201cInstances 1\u201d and you\u2019ll see the computer you setup just now in Step 2. Under \u201cStatus\u201d it\u2019ll probably still be starting up. Wait a few minutes and refresh until the Status has a green light and says \u201cRunning\u201d.To the left of that you\u2019ll see the IP address column, with a \u201cInternet IP Address\u201d and \u201cPrivate IP Address\u201d. The first is our public address so we can find our computer on the internet, the second is internal only and we\u2019ll need them both later for our VPN, so make a note of them.If you\u2019re on Windows you need to download a program called PuTTY, you can download it here. But if you\u2019re on Mac it\u2019s much easier, just open a program called \u201cTerminal\u201d you already have. If you\u2019ve haven\u2019t used these before don\u2019t fear \u2014 I\u2019ll list a bunch of commands you need to run below, all you need to do is copy and paste them in, and press Enter to run them.Mac Users \u2014 TerminalWe\u2019ll start with one import command. First type the below line but you need to replace \u201cyour_ip\u201d with the \u201cInternet IP Address\u201d you saw just now. E.g. if my column said \u201c20.20.20.20 (Internet IP Address)\u201d you need to type ssh root@20.20.20.20ssh root@your_ipNow type the password you set earlier and press Enter.Windows Users \u2014 PuTTYOpen PuTTY, enter the \u201cInternet IP Address\u201d you saw just now under \u201cHost Name\u201d, make sure \u201cConnection type\u201d is SSH, and click \u201cOpen\u201d. It will say \u201clogin as\u201d, enter root, and then enter the password you set earlier.And we\u2019re in! This is SSH, you are now logged into and controlling another computer hundreds of miles away while you\u2019re lying in bed with your cat \u2014 cool huh?Step 4 \u2014 set up a Shadowsocks serverA what server you may be thinking? This is a server specifically designed to get around the Chinese firewall so we can continue to watch cat videos on YouTube smoothly. The standard VPN services like ExpressVPN are basically setting up a server which lots of people are sharing. You\u2019re going to set up a private server, just for you!Type these commands and press Enter like before (but they\u2019re now being run on our remote computer), I\u2019ll briefly explain what\u2019s going on as we proceed:Install shadowsockspip install shadowsocks2. Download a library for encrypting our internet traffic which shadowsocks requireswget https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/releases/download/1.0.10/libsodium-1.0.10.tar.gz3. Unzip ittar xf libsodium-1.0.10.tar.gz && cd libsodium-1.0.104. Install it./configure && make && make install5. Setup a config fileecho /usr/local/lib > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/usr_local_lib.conf6. Make sure we can use our new library by linking itldconfig7. Create a config file for our servervim /etc/shadowsocks.jsonWhoa, what happened here? We\u2019re using vim, a very powerful text editor. If you\u2019re not familiar with it, I\u2019ll walk you through what you need to know.We\u2019re going to copy and paste the below text, but like before you need to replace your_private_IP_address with the \u201cPrivate IP Address\u201d you noted down earlier. And replace your_password with a password that you can use to login to your VPN. Keep in mind you may want to share your VPN with others later on, so probably best to not make it the same as your Facebook password, in case your cat tries to hack in (again).{    \"server\":\"your_private_IP_address\",    \"server_port\":8000,    \"local_port\":1080,    \"password\":\"your_password\",    \"timeout\":600,    \"method\":\"chacha20\"}So to do this in vim, first press \u201ca\u201d on your keyboard. Now paste (\u2318/Ctrl + V) the above with your values. Press \u201cesc\u201d on your keyboard to finish, and then type :wq to save and quit the file.8. Start our server if the remote computer restartsWe\u2019re about to start our VPN server, but we don\u2019t want to keep having to come back and set it up again if our remote computer restarts at some point in the future, right? To avoid this, type the commandvim /etc/rc.localWe\u2019re back in vim. Press \u201ca\u201d again to edit the file, scroll down with your mouse or arrow keys (you can\u2019t click with your mouse), and at the end copy and paste this into its own line:/usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/ssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks.json -d startNow press \u201cesc\u201d and type :wq like before to save and quit.You\u2019re doing great, just one command to go!8. Run your shadowsocks serverssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks.json -d startBoom. That\u2019s it, if you don\u2019t see any errors your own personal VPN is set up and running, all for you. Feel free to close PuTTY / Terminal, now we actually need to use it\u2026Step 5 \u2014 download ShadowsocksNow we need to install a free program on your computer to connect to the server you just set up. Go to the Shadowsocks Download page and install the \u201cGUI Client\u201d for your system. Just download the \u201c.zip\u201d file it shows.Note that the download page has some mobile apps for accessing your VPN on your phone too! But I\u2019d recommend testing it works on your computer first.Open Shadowsocks and go to \u201cServers\u201d > \u201cServer Preferences\u201d. Under address, type the public IP (the \u201cInternet IP Address\u201d) you noted down earlier, and after the colon enter \u201c8000\u201d. For encryption we want \u201cchacha20\u201d and enter the password you just pasted into that file in Step 4. Under \u201cRemarks\u201d choose a name (e.g. \u201cSuper Awesome VPN\u201d) and click \u201cOK\u201d. Make sure Shadowsocks is enabled, and now try opening Google.com!I never thought seeing Google could be so beautifulShadowsocks is amazing because when you open a website, it will by default not use your VPN. So for example in China, if you go to Baidu.com it\u2019s not going to use your VPN and so be really fast. But Shadowsocks stores a list of websites that are blocked in China (e.g. Google and Facebook) and will use the VPN automatically for those. Magic!This setting is called \u201cProxy Auto Configure Mode\u201d. You\u2019ll see it has a tick next to it in the Shadowsocks menu. If you instead choose \u201cGlobal Mode\u201d, all websites will load through your VPN. But Chinese sites / apps (like WeChat) will probably be much slower.Congratulations on setting up your personal VPN!Now you have a VPN server setup, anyone else can access it if you let them. Just get someone you want to share access to it to follow Step 5 and provide them with the password you set. If there\u2019s only a few of you using it at the same time, it should still be quite fast, and you can split the cost together.Also don\u2019t forget your free credit will run out in a couple of months and start charging you, but it\u2019s definitely worth paying later on anyway! And keep an eye on how many cat videos you\u2019re streaming, the free credit allows 530GB data download per month, and will probably charge you a little bit if you go over that.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["VPN", "China", "Shadowsocks", "Alibabacloud"]}, {"title": "Ekv\u00e1dor\u200a\u2014\u200aden 18", "post_link": "https://medium.com/ekv%C3%A1dor-v%C3%BDprava-za-pivem/ekv%C3%A1dor-den-18-b9eb8a1ca9ba?source=search_post", "author_name": "Zden\u00e1l F.", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@zdendaf", "publish_date": "2019-02-08", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-08", "readtime": "1.35", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Ekv\u00e1dor\u200a\u2014\u200aden 18\u00dater\u00fd 5. \u00fanora \u2014 Zumbahua, QuilotoaZden\u00e1l F.FollowFeb 8 \u00b7 2 min readV noci je n\u00e1m v\u0161em trochu zima.

Comme avec toutes les entreprises VPN, il n\u2019y a aucun moyen de v\u00e9rifier cela, mais \u00e0 notre avis, IPVanish est absolument digne de confiance.

Certains ont pr\u00e9nomm\u00e9 IPVanish \u201cbasic\u201d comme service VPN parce qu\u2019il offre seulement ce dont vous avez besoin d\u2019un VPN sans beaucoup de d\u2019assaisonnements ou d\u2019options.Le service offre une bande passante illimit\u00e9e, un trafic P2P illimit\u00e9, une commutation de serveur illimit\u00e9e et un torrent anonyme. Une des questions que beaucoup de gens se posent quand ils choisissent un service VPN est les protocoles disponibles. IPVanish a effectivement quelques options, y compris PPTP, L2TP, OpenVPN, IPSec et IKEv@. Le service offre \u00e9galement un cryptage 256 bits. Tous les serveurs sont partag\u00e9s, et \u00e9vite le blocage de Google. Une autre caract\u00e9ristique d\u2019IPVanish est que beaucoup appr\u00e9cient est le grand nombre de serveurs disponibles. Ils ont plus de 400 serveurs dans 60 pays et plus de 40 000 adresses IP.Le service fonctionne aussi avec de nombreuses plates-formes diff\u00e9rentes.

Le VPN, mieux que tout autre proxy, s\u2019av\u00e8re \u00eatre la solution la mieux appropri\u00e9e pour remplir cette fonction.

Les experts \u0153uvrant dans ce monde assez particulier s\u2019accordent \u00e0 reconnaitre qu\u2019Express VPN et IPVanish sortent du lot. Il suffit de se pencher sur les avis expressvpn et les avis IPVanish pour se rendre compte de la diff\u00e9rence. S\u2019il est vrai que tous les logiciels VPN sont capables d\u2019attribuer une autre adresse IP, il n\u2019en est pas moins vrai que le soin que prennent ces deux fournisseurs pour la s\u00e9curisation des donn\u00e9es des utilisateurs est autrement plus important.Les points forts d\u2019Express VPNFigurant parmi les plus anciens VPN du march\u00e9, express vpn n\u2019est pas donn\u00e9. Mais il se distingue par sa rapidit\u00e9, une couverture de 45 pays dont la France, la Suisse et le Qu\u00e9bec et un logiciel permettant une utilisation tr\u00e8s simple sur iOS ou Android. Il b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie de plus, d\u2019une tr\u00e8s bonne stabilit\u00e9, qualit\u00e9 tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ciable lors des visionnages en streaming ou des t\u00e9l\u00e9chargements en P2P.

Par ailleurs, ExpressVPN utilise les serveurs DNS d\u2019ExpressVPN qui se r\u00e9v\u00e8lent tr\u00e8s performants dans les pays comme la Chine o\u00f9 la censure fait partie du quotidien.Les atouts d\u2019IP VanishIPVanish pour sa part dispose de serveurs dans 170 pays. Ils sont m\u00eame install\u00e9s au Panama et au Kazakhstan, ce qui constitue la meilleure preuve de sa capacit\u00e9 de vous fournir une identit\u00e9 factice en ligne. Autre particularit\u00e9 d\u2019IPVanish : il accepte les Bitcoins et ne demande qu\u2019 une adresse email pour pouvoir s\u2019inscrire , ce qui garantit un anonymat parfait. Pour crypter les donn\u00e9es, ipvanish propose un service de 256 bits sur le protocole L2TP et OpenVPN et 128 bits sur le cryptage PPTP. Gr\u00e2ce aux protocoles Open VPN, PPTP et L2TP, Ipvanish s\u2019adapte \u00e0 pratiquement tous les appareils fixes et mobiles permettant ainsi \u00e0 l\u2019utilisateur de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019une connexion s\u00e9curis\u00e9e sur Windows, Mac OS X, IOS, Android et bien d\u2019autres encore.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Express Vpn", "Ipvanish", "Vypr Vpn"]}, {"title": "Ipvanish En 2017", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@lesmeilleursvpn/ipvanish-en-2017-5eeaa6941542?source=search_post", "author_name": "LesMeilleursVPN", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@lesmeilleursvpn", "publish_date": "2017-04-11", "last_modified_date": "2018-02-06", "readtime": "1.16", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Ipvanish En 2017LesMeilleursVPNFollowApr 11, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readCommen\u00e7ons notre examen IPVanish en notant qu\u2019ils sont l\u2019un des seuls fournisseurs VPN tiers.

Having hit up the normal tourist attractions\u200a\u2014 Disney World, Universal Studios\u200a\u2014 we spent a few days in Saint Augustine where my aunt rented a condo. Saint Augustine is home to a large alligator farm, which sounds really cool as a kid \u2026 until you learn that alligators spend many warm days lying motionless as if made of plaster.Unimpressed by the massive yet motionless reptiles, we went to one of the live animal shows in hopes of some excitement. The \u201cScales & Tails Show\u201d did not disappoint. Midway through the show, I was invited on stage to participate in one of the hands-on activities: holding one end of a 5-foot-long stick while snakes were place upon it. This was enjoyable enough, until the host/handler thought it would be entertaining to move one of the snakes from the stick to my head. I will never forget the feeling of scales gripping my hat and the back of my nexk, followed by a forked tongue tickling the inner lobe of my left ear.Wait. What does it means if red touches black?!I survived (\u201cYou\u2019re okay, jack\u201d), but snakes would forever remain on my list of fobias.I know very few people who are fans of snakes. Most are scared of them, some tolerate them, but nobody likes them. Still, I think it\u2019s necessary to attempt a defense of snakes. At least some of them.In the third chapter of the Gospel According to Luke, there\u2019s a story about a public truth teller named John. Serving in the time of powerful occupying forces, regional puppet rulers, and corrupt religious leaders, John has the look of a crazy man out in the wilderness calling people to repent and be baptized. Apparently people are coming out of the woodwork to hear what he has to say.7 So John said to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, \u201cYou offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 8 Therefore produce fruit that proves your repentance, and don\u2019t begin to say to yourselves, \u2018We have Abraham as our father.\u2019 For I tell you that God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones! 9 Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.\u201d-Luke 3.7\u20139 (NET)Other translations refer to the crowds as a \u201cbrood of vipers,\u201d which sounds dastardly at best. Many hear within \u201cvipers\u201d the echoes of a serpent from Genesis 3, assuming therefore that John is calling those who come to him \u201cthe spawn of Satan.\u201d But these are some fairly strong presuppositions and disregard some of the powerful imagery.As Justo Gonzalez notes:When vipers are hatched, they remain together, perhaps under a rock, until they begin to mature. But if something threatens them, they spread out and flee.Luke\u200a\u2014 and by extension John\u200a\u2014 seems to be alluding to baby snakes who cling together hiding in dark and hidden places. Until, of course, something frightens them and they scatter out of hiding. The crowds who come to John have been awoken from their stupor, unsettled by the state of the world with which they are no longer content. They know that resting on their laurels and remaining inactive with an assumption of God\u2019s protection will lead to their demise and the demise of others.\u201cWhat then should we do?\u201d they ask.11 John answered them, \u201cThe person who has two tunics must share with the person who has none, and the person who has food must do likewise.\u201d 12 Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, \u201cTeacher, what should we do?\u201d 13 He told them, \u201cCollect no more than you are required to.\u201d 14 Then some soldiers also asked him, \u201cAnd as for us\u200a\u2014\u200awhat should we do?\u201d He told them, \u201cTake money from no one by violence or by false accusation, and be content with your pay.\u201d-Luke 3.11\u201314John doesn\u2019t give a simple, objective answer about what repentance should look like. Repentance is not feeling sorry for what you\u2019ve done and asking for forgiveness. Neither is repentance an action that everyone must repeat verbatim.Repentance is a subjective act of responding justly and faithfully to that which has unsettled your comfortable view of the world.Those with excess? Don\u2019t keep hoarding but give your excess to those in need.Tax collectors, known to take a hefty \u201cservice charge\u201d to deliver taxes to the Romans? Quit ripping people off and only take the tax.And soldiers, using your might to coerce people, to steal, and to build up riches? Be content with what you have and don\u2019t use violence to grasp after what you don\u2019t.Nearly two thousand years later, a few presuppositions follow a discussion like this about redistribution.The theological: \u201cThis sounds like works righteousness! We\u2019re saved by faith alone!\u201dThe political: \u201cThis sounds too much like socialism!\u201dThe charitable: \u201cYes, we ought to use our privilege to set people free!\u201dAs much as I could say about the first two, let\u2019s focus instead on the final claim. According to John, repentance and redistribution are just as much about our own freedom as generously giving freedom to other.Freedom is not just for those who are receiving, but also for those who are distributing. Certainly those who have lived without suddenly are freed from the worry of not having enough. But those with excess also have an opportunity to be unchained from things that control them.Freedom, it seems, is reciprocal.So is this good news? I suppose it depends upon who you ask.This is a message that will see the marginalized empowered.This is a message that will bring salvation to the house of a notoriously greedy tax collector named Zacchaeus.This is a message that the Lukan Jesus will pick up and take even further, going toe-to-toe with the Romans officials, the puppet king, and religious leaders.This is a message and messenger at which some snakes will lash out venomously, upset that someone\u200a\u2014 even God himself in human flesh\u200a\u2014 dare confront the status quo from which they profit.2016 was a hell of a year, one that left many of us\u200a\u2014 including people of faith\u200a\u2014 scurrying for cover. Our cold and dark places of comfort were upset, exposing us to a world that was much more hateful and ugly than we would have otherwise known or like to admit. The year has revealed to us the ways in which the world is not as it should be, as well as the ways in which we as followers of Jesus are not as we should be.So, fellow snakes, we have before us an option. Will we scatter back to our dark and comfortable hiding place which does not require moral fortitude and a nuanced view of the world? Or will repent of the status quo and step into the light, embracing the costly way of Jesus in pursuit of freedom for ourselves and our neighbors?Whoever has an ear, let them hear.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Underused Movements \u2014 The Viper Press/Muscle Snatch", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@adamfisher/underused-movements-the-viper-press-muscle-snatch-8280814e5b7d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Adam Fisher", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@adamfisher", "publish_date": "2015-01-09", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-13", "readtime": "2.51", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Underused Movements \u2014 The Viper Press/Muscle SnatchAdam FisherFollowJan 9, 2015 \u00b7 3 min readRecently, I started a new training program that involves training all of my competition lifts per day, a feat that is replacing the training style where I deadlifted every day. Honestly, it\u2019s not been as crazy as deadlifting every day, because I\u2019ve been a lot stricter about the intensities involved and as a result it\u2019s actually been pretty fun. In the first month, I\u2019ve put a PR on my squat \u2014 the first time I\u2019ve done so in a year \u2014 so I\u2019m rather proud of it.The plan involves four major lifts: the bench press, squat, deadlift, and overhead press, since I\u2019m looking to build up my overhead strength. Each day, two lifts are trained at a high intensity, while the other two are trained at an assistance intensity. This helps grease the groove, so to speak, activating sore muscle and helping aid in recovery as well as the development of muscle and joint strength. Most importantly, however, I\u2019ve come to use a lot more assistance movements than I used to as a result, and in my experimentation I\u2019ve come across a few new favorites.One of my new favorite accessory moves is called alternately the viper press or the muscle snatch, depending on what equipment you use. The viper press is done with the strongman log and the muscle snatch is done with the barbell, but otherwise the intent pretty similar.In the viper press, the log is brought to the waist and cradled before being brought overhead in a fast \u201cwhipping\u201d motion, using as much momentum as possible.In the muscle snatch, the barbell is deadlifted from the ground and then immediately whipped up into the snatch, only there is no squatting motion to get underneath the barbell. (The muscle snatch resembles the power snatch, although the power snatch tends to have just a little bit of a dip into a squat, whereas the muscle snatch should have none.)Or if you\u2019re Klokov, you can skip the standing bit and just do it in a full ATG squat.The movements are certainly different, most notably in hand position as a result of the equipment used, but they tend to work out similar things. Both involve a lot of different muscles \u2014 the posterior chain for the deadlift, the upper back for the initial pull, and the shoulders for the lockout. The viper press/muscle snatch are both hybrid strength/power movements, since they do involve a bit of momentum but not nearly the amount seen in traditional olympic lifting. This means that they\u2019re going to help build a lot of muscle while at the same time helping to build a lot of strength, without the high specificity of the olympic lifts.The training purposes of these movements are varied. While they won\u2019t work well with beginner or general population exercisers, they\u2019ve got good carryover to all your major strength sports \u2014 the viper press for strongman, and the muscle snatch for powerlifting and olympic lifting. CrossFit athletes will also likely see good results!Since the viper press/muscle snatch work out so many valuable muscles at once, they\u2019ve become a staple of my accessory work in this new program. Try them out, and you\u2019re definitely gonna find your traps and shoulders burning more than you expect, aside from getting a solid back workout. Just watch out, however, as you\u2019ll have to keep the weight relatively limited \u2014 start off with just a 45lb barbell (or even less, if you have access to lighter set-weight barbells) and work your way up from there.See Also: T-Nation\u2019s Article on the Muscle SnatchOriginally published at www.philosopher-warrior.com.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Da S\u00e9rie: T\u00e1 de bobeira? #6 BLACKMIRROR, Striking Vipers de Charlie Brooker", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@kekabarbosa/striking-vipers-60-min-2019-netflix-3d7d5eefc047?source=search_post", "author_name": "Keka Barbosa", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@kekabarbosa", "publish_date": "2019-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2019-07-11", "readtime": "2.85", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Da S\u00e9rie: T\u00e1 de bobeira? #6 BLACKMIRROR, Striking Vipers de Charlie BrookerKeka BarbosaFollowJun 11 \u00b7 3 min read2019 | 60 MIN | NETFLIXUm branquelo a\u00edGENTE ESSE EPIS\u00d3DIO \u00c9 SENSACIONALPoliamoristas do meu Brasel podem entrar, a festa \u00e9 VIP l\u00e1 em casa.ok.

This article has solved the very problems I was having with VIPER. The examples are of not much use since in a real use case you wouldn\u2019t create retain cycles (yeah that is actually in one of the examples). So thank you for creating this article explaining a much needed variation on VIPER.I am also curious as to how one module would present another. Laurie makes a great point, with one exception. The last idea of having Module(B) send back the wireframe instead of the view solves the problem of the module(B) knowing *how* to present itself (which I agree would be ideal). However given the strong reference chain, if you were to only send back wireframe(B) then the view(B) would be deallocated since nothing is holding on to it (it hasn\u2019t been presented yet) which would cause everything else in Module(B) to be deallocated except wireframe(B) (as it is being returned) and whatever it is holding onto.With that being said one could solve the issue by returning the view which solves the issue of other design patterns being able to work seamlessly with BVIPER. To also solve the *how* issue we would have to (a) be able to get to the wireframe from the view which I feel like violates the idea of the view never gets anything from the presenter or (b) send in an \u201cevent\u201d to the view with the fromViewController as a parameter, which would then be forwarded onto the presenter, similar to: (void)someLabelTextChangedTo:(NSString *)text but instead (void)presentModuleFromViewController(UIViewController *)viewController. Option (b) seems to solve all issues while not violating any of VIPER\u2019s rules. However, I\u2019m not sure if it is the cleanest way to solve this problem.Thought?", "responses": 1, "tags": []}, {"title": "the 3 globally best VPN services in china: expressVPN, vyprVPN and nordVPN", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vpnbest/3-globally-best-vpn-services-expressvpn-vyprvpn-and-nordvpn-f068921dde3f?source=search_post", "author_name": "best vpn", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vpnbest", "publish_date": "2018-12-23", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-26", "readtime": "0.93", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "the 3 globally best VPN services in china: expressVPN, vyprVPN and nordVPNbest vpnFollowDec 23, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readif you are going to mainland china, Iran or Arab countries of the middle east, such as Dubai, Saudi, you are advised to prepare a good VPN before your trip, which is very necessary.with a good VPN service, you can hide and change your real IP address, mask your location, encrypt your online data transfers, and access the blocked websites in countries with internet censorship(such as Iran, China, Arab countries in middle east), for example, you can visit google, twitter, telegram and YouTube in mainland China.the VPN services listed on this page are working effectively in the world:1 all support systems and devices of apple ios(iPhone, Mac, iPad), Android phone, windows and Linux computer2 all support online payment via PayPal, credit card(Visa, MasterCard, American Express) and Alipay(zhi fu bao \u652f\u4ed8\u5b9d)3 if you are not satisfied, all these VPN services support for refunds within the specified time after your purchasevisit their websites for the details.expressVPN, company registered in British Virgin Islands, began since 2009, 30-day money back guaranteenordVPN, company located in Panama, began since 2012, refund within 30 daysgolden frog vyprVPN, registered in Switzerland of Europe, began since year 2010, its premium account is suggested, you have the free trial of 3 daysat last, remember to choose and prepare your VPN BEFORE your trip./^ 2019 china best vpn app/service, best vpn working in china", "responses": 0, "tags": ["VPN", "Vpn China", "2019 China Vpn", "Vpn Iran", "Best Vpn In China"]}, {"title": "Viper Jobs", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@viper/viper-jobs-39166144d523?source=search_post", "author_name": "Gregg Mojica", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@viper", "publish_date": "2014-06-19", "last_modified_date": "2014-06-19", "readtime": "0.58", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Viper JobsJoin our Team!Gregg MojicaFollowJun 19, 2014 \u00b7 1 min readHello World!

But lately, I started noticing this ever-growing \u201cwining\u201d trend grow even bigger. Namely that a glass of wine a day is incredibly beneficial for one\u2019s health. There are countless articles on the internet, we are constantly being reminded of this everywhere in the media, and if you go through the magazine aisle, almost every single issue of every single women\u2019s publication has at least one article that mentions the miraculous health benefits of wine. The widespread suggestion is that if you want to reap the benefits, you should drink a glass of wine every day.Once this started catching my attention, I just thought it was annoying and kind of corny. The articles usually revolve around a bunch of girlfriends drinking wine and destressing, followed by an absolute reassurance that what you are doing is amazing and that you shouldn\u2019t worry, what you\u2019re doing is actually healthy, followed by some clich\u00e9 funny comment along the lines of \u201cDon\u2019t save up all your 7 drinks for the weekend.\u201d So now that this wining religion has become ubiquitous, it is starting to get me worried. It\u2019s pretty obvious that the target market is women. I\u2019m still trying to figure out the reason for that, but in the meantime, what I want to talk about is the dubiousness and in some cases pure idiocy of the notion that daily alcohol consumption should even be considered a member of the healthy habits category.So the main argument is that wine helps protect against heart disease by preventing cholesterol buildup in your arteries. The list of cure-all benefits the media touts that I\u2019ve come across so far includes dementia, sunburn, life expectancy, anti-aging, diabetes, depression, risk of stroke, brain decline, cataracts, cancer, obesity, inflammation, the list goes on and on\u2026 You name it, the court of public opinion claims that wine can do it for you and then some. This story sounds great until you start thinking critically about the suggestion of these outlets.In reality, the ingredient you want to focus on when talking about wine consumption in a positive light is resveratrol. This is the \u201cmiraculous\u201d ingredient, which has been linked to beneficial results in life longevity and heart health. However, in our day and age, resveratrol is widely available as a supplement. On one hand, supplements are kind of a black hole. It is an unregulated industry, and while there are studies that suggest that supplements work, there\u2019s just as many others that suggest that supplements are useless. On the other hand, resveratrol is one of those supplements, which has gone through multiple studies that suggest considerable evidence of its effectiveness. So when we talk about the benefits of wine, we want to talk about the benefits of resveratrol, not the benefits of drinking the alcoholic beverage itself.Of course, every article on the subject stresses on moderation, but we are still talking about regular daily alcohol consumption. Would you think the same way if I told you that you should drink a shot of tequila (which, according to the CDC, also falls in the moderate drinking category) every day 365 days a year, or a shot of vodka every day 365 days a year and promote this as a healthy desirable lifestyle? Let\u2019s be clear. I have a problem with this trend specifically because the media outlets keep pushing this as healthy. And it kind of reminds me of the times when smoking was promoted through commercials, the media, and even doctors as healthy.While you may not be an alcoholic by definition, if you drink one glass of wine every day, you have definitely developed dependency, meaning this has become a habit. This habit is consistently damaging your health, particularly so if you are elderly, and in the meantime, you think you are reaping the benefits of resveratrol, and detoxing. Alcohol, any type of alcohol, is not, never was, and never will be a preventative beverage. Maybe it is true that back in the day, when water sanitation was virtually nonexistent, drinking beer and wine was much safer for one\u2019s health, but in a modern civilized society, that is not the case anymore. And when you read about the Egyptians, or the Greeks, and how they classified wine as medicine or some such nonsense, remember, we\u2019re talking about a time when life expectancy was about 30 years and the Earth was believed to be flat. Ancient Egyptians\u2019s understanding of medicine shouldn\u2019t be dictating your health habits. We live in 2019, we have a better (not perfect, but at least better) understanding of the science behind resveratrol and we know how to get the benefits of those ingredients without the harmful effects of alcohol.My verdict. If you want to drink wine every day because you enjoy it, it tastes good, or it\u2019s become part of your daily routine, by all means, go ahead. I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s the gold standard when it comes to a healthy lifestyle, but assuming you\u2019re an adult, you have the freedom to do whatever you want with your health, no matter how stupid or detrimental it might be. But please, quit lying to yourself and spare me the nonsense about how you drink wine every day because of the health benefits. If you really just want to take advantage of said benefits, buy a bag of grapes, or if you\u2019re able to take supplements, go to your local vitamin store and get yourself some resveratrol. Enough with the argument about the supposed health benefits of drinking alcohol 365 days a year.Cheers to that.Read the whole article on my website here or go straight to www.dailyviper.com for more glorious content.

A property owner ought to examine the specialist\u2019s background, by accessing the site of the professional, and by speaking with customers and clients who were served previously by the Waterproofing Services Ontario CanadaMaking certain that the specialist has all licenses and is insured is a good start. Find out if they come from any professional trade organizations. These organizations generally serve the public interest along with the professional specialists. The professional that comes from such an organization is more apt to offer a greater requirement of service. These Waterproofing Contractors Toronto also have access to the latest developments in their area of knowledge.Asking friends and coworkers who had waterproofing done usually will yield a number of great candidates. Investigating the background of the company or individual you are about to trust with the most important purchase of your life ought to take a minimum of as much care as you would take into buying a car. Talking to multiple prospects will assist you for more information about the business and offer you a concept of what it is you want.Your Drain Repair Services Ontario CA contractor should be honest and open up to communicate concerning the project. Communication and consistent interactions with the contractor is the only way to avoid any confusions cropping up with the payments or the project conclusion. Make certain to examine that your contractor is organized and punctual.The specialist must attempt to meet every challenge concerning the project and be prepared to offer viable options. This is a direct reflection on the professional\u2019s experience levels. Most established waterproofing professionals or companies would have dealt with most of the obstacles relating to the various interiors and pipes systems of different houses.Payment option is another feature that needs to be considered, and if a contractor requests initial payment before the project gets initiated, it is deemed perfect to look for another professional. One can come by professionals who accept payment in installments, and who do not make a fuss as long as payments get settled when the job gets completed.It is also considered ideal to avoid professionals who push customers into taking rash decisions, without giving customers enough time to think about a particular proposal. A specialist who is eager just on his revenues, and who cannot meet the needs of his clients is not a perfect professional for the job.In their quest to find the best Underpinning Contractors Toronto CA, property owners can find a healthy list of professionals with the aid of web. The advertisements of local professionals function as an ideal source to obtain details concerning the contact details of such professionals. One can even count on local enhancement centers that offer details on waterproofing professionals in a particular area, and the centers reach to offer suggestions to help an enthusiast pick the ideal specialist.It is simple to be confused concerning your choice of waterproofing contractors, particularly because of the fact that the market is filled with a lot of different options. You can take some actions to find the very best by the industry standards. Start by reading different online evaluations published by existing clients of the individual contractors. Most professionals now have a sizeable online representation and you can easily look in to their suggestions and recommendations to get a concept about their know-how.For More Info:- Basement Waterproofing Contractors Toronto", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Startup"]}, {"title": "[New] First Man Full [720p-1080p]", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@vypequ/new-first-man-full-720p-1080p-c06e8b769abd?source=search_post", "author_name": "vypequ kiou", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@vypequ", "publish_date": "2018-09-18", "last_modified_date": "2018-09-18", "readtime": "2.73", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "[New] First Man Full [720p-1080p]vypequ kiouFollowSep 18, 2018 \u00b7 3 min read\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2013\u0b9c\u06e9\u06de\u06e9\u0b9c \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2013  Just Click Link !!

We usually measure the beginning of time since the first known event by men: the big bang.The time from when the big bang happened until today is what we called, the cosmic time.

Recently, support for this position has faltered, owing to some very well-designed studies. Indeed, some prominent groups of researchers have now reanalyzed the available evidence that muscle damage contributes to muscle growth, and have subsequently dropped it, leaving only mechanical tension and metabolic stress.I predict that in another ten years, hypertrophy researchers will have also reanalyzed the evidence that metabolic stress contributes to muscle growth, and will subsequently reject the hypothesis that metabolite accumulation has anything to do with muscle growth.They will realize that local muscular fatigue (and not metabolic stress) is the trigger for high-threshold motor units to be recruited during light load strength training to failure, while muscle fiber shortening velocities are simultaneously reduced, and that this combination allows greater mechanical tension to be produced (and therefore experienced) by the muscle fibers of those motor units, because of the force-velocity relationship. What happens to the muscle fibers of low-threshold motor units is irrelevant, since they have been trained to their maximum size already by the activities of daily life.In an earlier article on this blog, I did an historical analysis looking at the key phases in the development of the hypothesis, showing where we made wrong turnings. This article takes a different approach, and walks through the many reasons why you might still be tempted to see metabolic stress as a contributor to muscle growth, and why that would be a mistake.If you like this article, you will also enjoy my book.#1. Fatigue and motor unit recruitmentIt has been proposed that metabolites increase motor unit recruitment, and that this thereby allows a greater number of muscle fibers to be exposed to mechanical tension.This is not a very accurate description of what is going on.Motor unit recruitment increases when we increase effort levels. Effort levels can be voluntarily increased if we discover that we can no longer lift a weight with our previous levels of effort. This situation occurs when fatigue develops during strength training. As fatigue arises, we find that the muscle fibers of our low-threshold motor units can no longer exert sufficient force to continue doing the task that we want to perform. We therefore increase our effort levels and push harder, and this recruits additional motor units to compensate for the muscle fibers that are fatigued.Fatigue occurs inside muscle fibers due to three mechanisms, which are: (1) reductions in the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (disruptions to the excitation-contraction coupling process), (2) reductions in the sensitivity of myofibrils to calcium ions (this is essentially cutting the line of communication between the excitation-contraction coupling process and the crossbridge cycle), and (3) reductions in the ability of actin-myosin crossbridges to produce force (disruptions to the crossbridge cycle).Metabolites can cause fatigue (and thereby require us to increase effort and thereby increase motor unit recruitment) through all of these mechanisms. Yet, they are not necessary. Eccentric contractions can cause fatigue and require us to increase motor unit recruitment by reducing the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum without any metabolite accumulation. Muscle damage can also increase motor unit recruitment at a given level of force during the recovery period from exercise, without the presence of metabolites. Ultimately, the only thing that is necessary for motor unit recruitment to increase is for a fatiguing mechanism to occur and reduce the force-producing ability of some of the muscle fibers in a muscle.In other words, we increase motor unit recruitment by increasing effort levels, and effort levels need to be increased whenever the muscle fibers of our low-threshold motor units become fatigued and can no longer produce enough force to continue lifting the weight on the bar. Fatigue can be mediated by metabolite accumulation, but fatigue can also occur without the presence of metabolites. Therefore, to claim that metabolite accumulation *causes* an increase in motor unit recruitment is misleading, since it is neither the direct cause nor necessary.N.B. the force-velocity relationshipIt is worth noting that the force-velocity relationship is rarely discussed in the context of hypertrophy, despite the fact that is the main regulator of muscle fiber force production, and therefore of the mechanical tension that each muscle fiber experiences during a contraction.Motor unit recruitment is increased by effort. Therefore, if we exert maximal effort on a rep, then recruitment will be maximal. This can happen regardless of the weight on the bar. Indeed, light-load ballistic movements like throwing a ball or jumping involve high levels of motor unit recruitment, even though they involve very low levels of force production. This is because the level of motor unit recruitment only determines the number of muscle fibers that are activated. It does not determine the force that each fiber produces.Indeed, light-load ballistic or high-velocity exercises do not trigger very much (if any) hypertrophy precisely because the force exerted and experienced by each fiber is too low. We know it is not \u201ctime under tension\u201d that causes the effect, because of studies that have controlled this variable. The reason that each fiber exerts such low forces in fast contractions is because of the fast muscle fiber shortening velocities. Consequently, there are fewer actin-myosin crossbridges formed at any one time, and the number of bound actin-myosin crossbridges is the primary determinant of muscle fiber force (and therefore also of mechanical tension).Importantly, fatigue causes a reduction in muscle fiber shortening velocity that follows a very similar profile, regardless of the weight on the bar. Therefore, fatigue also allows the muscle fibers of the high-threshold motor units to exert very high forces as they are recruited towards the end of a set. In this way, the effect of fatigue differs from that of effort, because effort is only linked to the level of motor unit recruitment, and not also to the level of mechanical tension being experienced by individual muscle fibers.#2. Fiber type-specific hypertrophyIt has been suggested the existence of fiber-type specific hypertrophy justifies considering metabolic stress as a mechanism that can cause muscle growth, since metabolic stress is usually greater when using lighter weights. Indeed, a recent study found that high-frequency training with lighter loads with blood flow restriction (BFR) caused more type I muscle fiber growth than normal strength training with heavier loads.However, this suggestion ignores another key study that has also reported preferential type I muscle fiber growth. If we look at these studies together, it is immediately very clear what is causing the phenomenon (and it is definitely not metabolic stress).The other study reported that when the eccentric phase of normal dynamic strength training with moderate loads is performed very slowly (to increase the time under tension in that contraction mode), there is preferential type I (slow twitch) fiber hypertrophy. Critically, such slow eccentric phases involve lower metabolic stress than strength training with faster eccentric phases. This study therefore demonstrates that type I fiber type-specific hypertrophy can also occur with lower (and not higher) levels of metabolic stress.So why might type I fiber type-specific hypertrophy occur in each case?Slow eccentric phases \u2014 in eccentric contractions, it is harder to activate a muscle voluntarily, and central nervous system (CNS) fatigue is greater. What is more, during the lowering phase of normal strength training, the level of effort is low (even when using a slow tempo). Therefore, motor unit recruitment is low, and the highest threshold motor units that control type II muscle fibers are likely not subjected to any loading during such contractions. This means that slow lowering phases during normal strength training likely involve high levels of mechanical loading (and for long periods of time) on the low-threshold and lowest high-threshold motor units, all of which control type I muscle fibers. While the type I muscle fibers of the low-threshold motor units do not grow, the type I muscle fibers controlled by the high-threshold motor units do, and this causes preferential type I hypertrophy.High frequency strength training with light loads and BFR \u2014 the study that found greater type I muscle fiber growth after training with light loads and BFR used a fairly high frequency. In high frequency strength training, CNS fatigue is often greater, because there is insufficient time to recover from one workout before doing the next one. Also, CNS fatigue is slightly greater when using lighter loads, than when using heavier loads. CNS fatigue causes a reduction in the level of motor unit recruitment.Consequently, we can see that in both studies that have found preferential type I muscle fiber growth, there is good reason to believe that a lack of motor unit recruitment is the main contributing factor, not metabolic stress. When motor unit recruitment is reduced, the very last high-threshold motor units that control the only type II muscle fibers in the muscle are not recruited.#3. Reactive oxygen species (oxidative stress)Researchers have suggested that the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a mechanism by which metabolic stress could cause hypertrophy because taking antioxidants seems to reduce levels of anabolic signaling after workouts and muscle growth after strength training.To address these observations, it helps to understand them in the context of what we currently know about (i) the role played by ROS in fatigue during exercise (and how antioxidants affect this), and (ii) the effects of ROS on muscle damage after a workout (and how antioxidants affect this).#i. Role played by ROS in fatigue during exerciseROS are produced during fatiguing exercise, likely in response to the influx of calcium ions. ROS can be created through a number of mechanisms during exercise (the mitochondria, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, phospholipase A2 (PLA2), and xanthine oxidase), but the main source during fatiguing contractions is unclear. If you are interested, most literature reviews cover this issue in quite a lot of detail.There are three ways in which peripheral fatigue can occur during exercise: (1) reductions in the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (disruptions to the excitation-contraction coupling process), (2) reductions in the sensitivity of myofibrils to calcium ions (this is essentially cutting the line of communication between the excitation-contraction coupling process and the crossbridge cycle), and (3) reductions in the ability of actin-myosin crossbridges to produce force (disruptions to the crossbridge cycle).Traditionally, it has been accepted that the main mechanism by which ROS increase fatigue during exercise is by reducing the sensitivity of myofibrils to calcium ions. However, it has also been noted that ROS can cause a reduction in the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Thus, ROS seem to cause reductions in strength during exercise through at least two of the three mechanisms of peripheral fatigue. Even so, the fatiguing effects of ROS are very complicated. It seems likely that ROS sometimes cause an increase in myofibrillar calcium sensitivity and sometimes cause a decrease. Indeed, the external application of ROS during in vitro studies very often causes increases in myofibrillar sensitivity to calcium. When this happens, it is likely that a greater proportion of peripheral fatigue results from impaired release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.Antioxidant supplements have been found to reduce fatigue in submaximal but not maximal exercise, in animal models and also in exercising humans. Recent investigations have suggested that they may negate the (occasionally) positive effects of ROS on myofibrillar sensitivity to calcium ions, and negate the (usually) negative effects of ROS on the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In this way, they shift the fatiguing effects of ROS away from an impaired release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and towards impaired myofibrillar sensitivity to calcium ions. This is important, because impaired release of calcium ions is caused by damage to the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ion release channels, and this is a trigger for endurance-related adaptations, including mitochondrial biogenesis.Therefore, we can explain the negative effects of antioxidants on endurance exercise adaptations by the observation that they reduce the damage to the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ion release channels that is caused by ROS produced during exercise.Why is this important?Well, muscle fiber growth is closely tied to an increase in capillarization regardless of the load used during training, because more capillaries are needed to match the larger oxygen requirements of bigger muscle fibers. Indeed, high responders to strength training may have higher levels of capillarization before starting a training program. Conversely, impairing increases in capillarization may lead to impaired hypertrophy. Thus, antioxidants may exert their negative effects on hypertrophy by the same mechanism, since impairing a certain level of endurance-related adaptations would be expected to stop muscle fiber growth from happening.#ii. Effects of ROS on muscle damage after a workoutROS appear when calcium ions accumulate inside the cytoplasm, after the mitochondria are overloaded and cannot take up any more. The presence of calcium ions also leads to the production of phospholipases, which degrade the inside of the muscle fiber membrane, thereby allowing more calcium ions to flow in. The high concentration of calcium ions that results then causes muscle damage, through the release of phospholipases and calpains, which are proteases. Therefore, ROS are a good indicator that muscle damage has occurred inside muscle fibers.Additionally, ROS contribute directly to the muscle damaging processes themselves, likely through peroxidation of phospholipids in the muscle cell membrane. While causing damage directly, this also allows more calcium ions to flow into the muscle fiber, and exert their damaging effects. It is therefore unsurprising that a variety of different antioxidant supplements have been found to reduce the amount of muscle damage that occurs after exercise.Antioxidants have been found to reduce the anabolic signaling processes that occur after a workout. Such anabolic signaling processes are often assumed to relate solely to muscle fiber hypertrophy. However, it is well-established that anabolic signaling processes (such as the mTOR pathway) are directed towards muscle damage repair and hypertrophy. Thus, we might expect that any treatment that reduces the muscle damage caused by a workout will simultaneously reduce levels of anabolic signaling. Indeed, it is worth noting that in the one study that has measured the effects of antioxidant supplements on post-workout anabolic signaling and long-term muscle growth, anabolic signaling was reduced but hypertrophy was not.Even so, some research has found that antioxidants reduce muscle growth and strength gains in humans when taken during long-term strength training, although not all investigations have found this effect. This has been explained by attributing ROS with the ability to signal hypertrophy by elevating mTOR signaling, mediated by elevations in calcium ions. In my view, the only way that mTOR signaling would be elevated by an increase in calcium ions is in consequence to their damaging effects on the muscle cell. Indeed, anabolic signaling is identical when mechanical tension is equated but muscle fibers are active (with calcium ions present) or passive (with calcium ions absent). Moreover, the presence of calcium ions without mechanical tension is insufficient to trigger anabolic signaling or developmental muscle growth. It seems far more likely that ROS mediate endurance-related adaptations, and that interfering with these is what blunts hypertrophy, since a certain level of capillarization is necessary to sustain muscle fiber growth.SummaryROS increase fatigue during exercise by disrupting the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Through this mechanism (and also by their damaging effects on the muscle cell membrane), they cause muscle damage after a workout. Thus, antioxidants reduce fatigue during exercise and muscle damage (and associated anabolic signaling) after a workout. ROS also trigger endurance-related adaptations by disrupting the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Since antioxidants interfere with this process, such supplements can suppress endurance-related adaptations to exercise. While antioxidants have also been found to interfere with hypertrophy after exercise, the current mechanism for explaining this by implicating ROS in anabolic signaling processes is not satisfactory. It seems more likely that the effects of ROS on endurance-related adaptations and their supporting effects on muscle fiber growth are the real reason for the disruptive effects of antioxidants on muscle growth.#4. Lactate (and other hormones)Recently, there has been interest in lactate as an anabolic signaling agent, and it has been suggested this signaling could be a key mechanism by which metabolic stress could trigger muscle growth.Indeed, some in vitro research in myoblasts has found that lactate increases satellite cell activation. Similar in vitro research in myotubes has found that lactate has anabolic signaling effects. While satellite cell activation could be a general response to exercise (especially when the physical activity model used is endurance training), the anabolic signaling effects are harder to explain away. Also, some in vivo research using rodent muscle has found that lactate can act as an anabolic signaling molecule and trigger muscle growth. Yet, since lactate triggers the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and since ROS is very likely a cause of muscle fiber damage, it may be that the presence of lactate stimulates muscle damage repair signaling in such studies, which might easily be conflated with hypertrophy signaling.Whatever the exact reason for the signaling effects of lactate in these studies, it is highly unlikely that lactate has any stimulating effect on muscle fiber growth, because of where it goes once it has been created. When lactate is produced during glycolysis, it is immediately shuttled out of lactate-producing cells and into lactate-consuming cells. Lactate-consuming cells include other muscle fibers of the same muscle, other muscle fibers of other muscles in the body, and organs, including the brain, liver, and kidneys. In being shuttled to such organs through the bloodstream (especially the brain), lactate does have signaling effects, thereby acting like a hormone.Therefore, if lactate (or any other hormone for that matter) were to have a signaling effect on muscle fibers to increase in size, then it would increase muscle size indiscriminately around the body. In fact, the muscles that would increase in size most would be those that contain lactate-consuming cells, and not the lactate-producing cells themselves. This would contradict everything we see when taking measurements of muscle size after strength training, which is that increases in muscle fiber size are very localized to the muscles (and even the regions of muscles) that produce force during a workout.#5. Muscle cell swellingDuring strength training, muscles often swell due to increased water content. This swelling lasts for approximately one hour after a workout when lifters are habituated to the exercise, but it lasts for longer in untrained individuals, because of the greater muscle damage. It is frequently associated with those types of strength training that involve greater local muscular fatigue, such as light loads, short rest periods, and advanced techniques such as drop sets.The exact nature of this muscle swelling is uncertain, although it probably involves an increase in the volume of individual muscle fibers. If it does involve an increase in muscle fiber volume (rather than an increase in the fluid content of the interstitial spaces), then it will necessarily cause outward deformation of the fiber, and this change could be detected in the same way as mechanical tension by receptors near to the surface of the muscle cell.Importantly, however, swelling of individual muscle fibers would not involve the exact same deformations as muscular contractions. Muscular contractions cause each working muscle fiber to bulge outwards at the M line, at the point where the actin and myosin filaments are overlap to a greater extent, because of a reduction in the size of the H zone. However, an increase in volume of the muscle fiber would cause a much more uniform increase in the diameter of the muscle fiber, which may not have the same stimulating effect.#6. SensationsWe often naturally assume that when the sensations that we perceive from our body are stronger, the resulting effects likely to be greater. While few researchers mention this, it is likely a key reason why many people firmly believe that strength training with light loads to failure has different effects from heavy load strength training.We can perceive a number of different sensations during strength training, including (1) effort, (2) fatiguing sensations, (3) pain, (4) whole muscle force, (5) stretch, and (6) where our limbs are in space (proprioception).Effort is particularly important, because the level of effort is directly related to the level of neural drive, and therefore the degree of motor unit recruitment. Corollary discharge, which is a copy of the central motor command, increases as central motor command increases. Corollary discharge activates sensory areas inside the brain that produce the sensation of effort. Even so, effort is unrelated to mechanical tension experienced by single muscle fibers, because if the weight is light and we are unfatigued, the bar speed produced at high levels of effort will be very fast, and therefore mechanical tension will be low.Fatiguing sensations are also worth commenting upon. While it was originally assumed that fatiguing sensations were caused by lactate or acidosis, we now know that the effect is caused by the presence of multiple metabolites inside the muscle at the same time (hydrogen ions, lactate, and ATP) and triggering signaling along group III/IV afferent neurons. While fatiguing sensations are therefore a good indicator of metabolite accumulation, they are not a good indicator of fatigue, since this can occur without metabolites. Even so, since metabolite accumulation increases with increasing repetition maximum during strength training, there is a clear difference in the sensations that we perceive when training in different rep ranges.Importantly, we are unable to perceive the mechanical tension experienced by single muscle fibers when they are working. If you move your limbs very slowly for a short time against no resistance through a small range of motion, you experience few of the above sensations. The working muscle fibers are few in number, so the level of effort is minimal. And the duration of exercise is short, so fatiguing sensations and pain are also not present. The range of motion is small, so there is no stretch. However, the mechanical tension that is experienced by the muscle fibers of the recruited motor units is incredibly high, because of the slow speed and the force-velocity relationship. In fact, the muscle fiber that you are using are producing extremely high forces (but they do not get damaged, because they are so oxidative, which means that they can easily deal with the high level of calcium ion influx).When we lift a heavy weight, we experience high levels of effort and a high level of whole muscle force. When we lift moderate and light loads to failure, we experience high levels of effort and fatiguing sensations, and perhaps also pain. Consequently, the experience that we have is different between the types of strength training, which leads us to assume that the effects are different. In fact, they are the same, because the real mechanism that is causing muscle growth (mechanical tension on individual muscle fibers) we cannot detect at all. This means that what we feel during a workout is largely unrelated to its effectiveness for muscle growth.What is the takeaway?Metabolic stress (the accumulation of metabolites, such as lactate, phosphate, hydrogen ions, and reactive oxygen species) put on a very good show of appearing to cause muscle growth. However, it is only mechanical tension that really triggers hypertrophy. Fatigue can affect the mechanical tension that the muscle fibers of high-threshold motor units experience, but fatigue is not the same thing as metabolite accumulation, as it can occur in its absence.During normal strength training, muscle fibers only experience mechanical tension after they have been activated by motor unit recruitment. Fatigue can require us to exert more effort and therefore increase motor unit recruitment by reducing the force that low-threshold motor units produce, which necessitates the recruitment of high-threshold motor units to compensate. Fatigue can also increase the mechanical tension that each activated muscle fiber exerts, by slowing down the overall contraction velocity of the muscle. Even so, in both cases, fatigue is merely the indirect method by which a muscle fiber is exposed to increased mechanical tension. Mechanical tension is still the only direct mechanism that triggers muscle fiber growth.If you like this article, you will also enjoy my book.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Fitness", "Hypertrophy", "Muscle Building", "Bodybuilding", "Exercise"]}, {"title": "3 Different Ways to Tune Hyperparameters (Interactive Python Code)", "post_link": "https://towardsdatascience.com/3-different-ways-to-tune-hyperparameters-interactive-python-code-87548d7f2365?source=search_post", "author_name": "Will Badr", "author_link": "https://towardsdatascience.com/@will.badr", "publish_date": "2019-08-06", "last_modified_date": "2019-08-06", "readtime": "4.5", "claps": 138, "voters": 20, "content": "Photo by chuttersnap on Unsplash3 Different Ways to Tune Hyperparameters (Interactive Python Code)An Interactive Guide to Optimizing and Tuning HyperparametersWill BadrFollowAug 6 \u00b7 5 min readHyperparameters (HP) are those parameters that machine or deep learning algorithms cannot learn by training. The value of those parameters needs to be set before the training process and it can control how the algorithm learns from the data. Hyperparameters (HP) can be the number of layers or a neural network or number of nodes in a layer, it can be the learning rate or the type of optimizer that the neural network can use. Getting the right hyperparameters can be counter-intuitive, it is more of a trial and error process. Hence, we have the need to find a way to automatically tune those parameters to get the best combination that will maximize the ML model performance.In this article, I will discuss a few ways to optimize and tune the hyperparameters (HP) to either maximize or minimize the objective metrics (Maximize when the metric is accuracy and minimize if the metric is RMSE or any other loss function).But before we dive deeper into the hyper-parameters optimization part, let's cover some important concepts:Objective Function:Machine Learning can be simply defined as learning behaviour from experience. By learning here, we mean getting better and improving at some certain task over time. But what constitutes an improvement?In order to develop a function to judge the improvement, we need to have formal measures of how good or bad our models are. In machine learning, we call these \u201cobjective functions\u201d. The most common objective function is squared error which is basically the difference between the predicted value and the actual ground truth. If this value is large, then the accuracy is low. Our target from optimizing the hyperparameters will be to minimize this objective function. Getting the right combination of the model\u2019s hyperparameters can contribute largely into the model\u2019s performance, Let\u2019s have a look at how we can tune those parameters to minimize the objective function:1- Grid Search:One way of tuning the hyperparameters is to define an equal range for each HP and have the computer try all possible combinations of parameter values. It can be a great approach to get the best combination of HPs. It works by putting the HPs that you want to tune in an n-dimensional grid then try each and every combination in this grid. You can either use nested loops to achieve that or you can use some ready-made libraries such as Scikit Learn \u2014 GridSearchCV. Let\u2019s have a look at how it works, the example below will try to find the best combination of hyperparameters (C, Gamma and Kernel) to build a classifier for the MNIST dataset:(Interactive Code \u2014 Run the code yourself by clicking on the play button)The code above will brute force and try every possible combination of those three hyper-parameters then print out the best combination.Pros: This method will get the best hyper-parameter.Cons: This is an exhaustive operation. If the hyper-parameters range or number is high, the possibilities can be in millions and it will take so much time to finish. It also follows a sequence without considering past experience.2- Random Search:As the name suggests, it will try to randomly select a pre-defined number of combination of hyper-parameters that will give some indication on what would be the best hyper-parameters. Now, let\u2019s see some code:(Interactive Code \u2014 Run the code yourself by clicking on the play button)As you can see in the code, you can define the number of times or iterations you want to pick a random set of hyper-parameters then try them out and get the best combination.Pros: Much faster than the Grid Search method.Cons: May not return the best combination of hyper-parameters that would return the best accuracy. It also doesn\u2019t consider past evaluations and it will continue the iterations regardless of the results.3- Bayesian Optimization:In the above examples, we had an objective metric which is the accuracy and we also had an objective function that tries to maximize the metric and minimize the loss. Bayesian Optimization approach tries to find the value that minimizes an objective function by building a probability model based on past evaluation results of the objective metric. It tries to find the balance between the exploration of the best region that contains the best hyperparameters and the exploitation of this region to maximize/minimize the objective metric.The problem of optimizing hyper-parameters is that it is an expensive process to assess the performance of a set of HPs because we have to build the corresponding graphs or neural networks in each iteration, then we have to train it, and finally, we have to assess the performance. The optimization process can take hours or days but in this example, we will train on only 3 epochs so that you can see the best HPs and then use those to train on more epochs.Let\u2019s have a look at the example below that uses Bayesian Optimization to tune a neural network for the MNIST dataset. We will use scikit-optimize library to perform the HPO. It\u2019s one of the libraries that has implemented the Bayesian Optimization algorithm:(Interactive Code \u2014 Run the code yourself by clicking on the play button)Conclusion:Optimizing the hyperparameters for machine learning models is vital to the performance of the machine learning models and the process of tuning the HPs is not intuitive and can be a complex task. The article above shows three popular ways to automatically tune these parameters. We have also explored the scikit-optimize (skopt) library which is still under development at the time of writing this article, but it is an extremely powerful tool. It has a very neat implementation of the Bayesian Optimization approach, which is vastly superior to Grid Search and Random Search especially when it comes to complex tasks and a large number of hyper-parameters.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Machine Learning", "Data Science", "Deep Learning", "Statistics", "Artificial Intelligence"]}, {"title": "An Implementation Example of Notarization in Hyperledger Fabric", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@kctheservant/an-implementation-example-of-notarization-in-hyperledger-fabric-e66fab155fdb?source=search_post", "author_name": "KC Tam", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@kctheservant", "publish_date": "2019-03-28", "last_modified_date": "2019-03-28", "readtime": "11.9", "claps": 28, "voters": 15, "content": "An Implementation Example of Notarization in Hyperledger FabricKC TamFollowMar 28 \u00b7 12 min readOverviewNotarization is always considered as a good use case in Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). It is largely due to the nature of data immutability, transaction audibility and decentralization in DLTs.As mentioned in my previous works (link), there are different types of notarization. This work is an application about proof-of-ownership: to show a document owned by someone is recorded in ledger using digital signature technology.Theoretically this type of application can run on any DLT setup, be it permissionless and permissioned one. In fact I have developed one in Ethereum Rinkeby testnet. However in this article the application is built on top of Hyperledger Fabric, a permissioned blockchain platform. I will talk about these two platforms later.This article provides some in-depth discussion on the chaincode and client applications. All the codes and demonstration flow are provided for easy hands-on practice.DesignOwnership of a Document by Digital SignatureAs said, the mechanism of proving ownership is through digital signature in public key cryptography. Each individual is given a key pair, designated as a private key and a public key. These are mathematically related. Anything encrypted with private key can only be decrypted by the corresponding public key. In digital signature use, the document-to-be-validated is first \u201chashed\u201d to a fixed length (called hash or digest) and encrypted with one\u2019s private key. The process is called signing, and the result is called one\u2019s signature on that document-to-be-validated.For anyone who wishes to verify the signature, the document-to-be-validated, the signature, and the public key of the owner is needed. The signature is first decrypted with the public key. The result is compared to the hash of document-to-be-validated. If identical, anyone can conclude that the document is signed by someone who owns the private key, corresponding to the public key being used.There is a small caveat here: I simply equate \u201cone signs a document\u201d to \u201cone owns a document\u201d. It may be possible in some cases but not in others. In real life further process may be needed to enhance the ownership. Again, for sake of demonstration, this is well assumed.Identity in Ethereum and Hyperledger FabricTheoretically this type of application and the digital signature can be done almost in all types of blockchain platform. In fact I also have developed this similar application on Ethereum Rinkeby almost a year ago (and it is still running).However, being a permissionless blockchain, Ethereum has no implicit way to link the holding of private/public key to one\u2019s identity. I am taking a tedious approach by adding a layer of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), using X509 certificate to identify individual, and document signing and verification is done on X509 certificate instead of native Ethereum network.Hyperledger Fabric as a permissioned blockchain requires anything (and anyone) is identified before using the network. And good enough they are using X509 certificates for identification. Therefore, the same set of certificate is used for both signing transaction in fabric network, and signing document for application.Using permissioned blockchain like Hyperledger Fabric brings in both good sides and bad sides. On one side the identify mechanism is already there, simplifying the design. On the other hand, one has to build the fabric network and after that maintain it, and the level of distribution is far lower than a permissionless blockchain network like Ethereum. Nevertheless, both cases rely on centralized element (the Certificate Authority, CA) and therefore trust-level wise, they are the same.User enrollment to CA. Private key is kept secret while certificate is made public.Use X509 to validate the ownership (signature) of a documentOverall FlowSo the design of application looks like this. Application user is first registered and enrolled into the CA. After enrollment the user is given a signing key (i.e. private key) and the certificate, which contains user\u2019s identity, user\u2019s public key, and CA\u2019s signature on the certificate. This information is stored in user\u2019s wallet.When a user (originator) needs to record the ownership of a document, the application computes the document hash, and the signature using user\u2019s private key. These two pieces of information is submitted to the fabric network. The ledger in fabric network will record the signature and timestamp of submission, with the document hash as key.When anyone needs to verify that ownership of that document, the information needed is the document itself and the originator\u2019s certificate. The application will compute the hash of the document and retrieve the record from the ledger based on the hash. If found, the signature and the timestamp is retrieved. Then the application performs the validation by using the given signature and public key in the certificate. After validation, one can be sure that this document has been signed by the originator, and the record is found in the ledger.The validation fails when one is using someone\u2019s else certificate (not the originator) or that document has not been recorded before.Application Deep DiveApplication in Hyperledger Fabric is mainly composed of two portions: the chaincode (the \u201csmart contract\u201d being executed in endorsing peers in the fabric network), and the client applications (the client portion interacting with the chaincode using software development kit (SDK). Here we will take a look on both.ChaincodeThe chaincode is responsible for interacting with the ledger. In our example, we largely adapt the chaincode of fabcar example inside fabric-samples. Here I just highlight those relevant portions in the chaincode.Data Structure in LedgerAs the purpose of our application is to keep the signature and timestamp of a document submitted by a user, we use a rather simple data structure to keep this.type DocRecord struct { Signature   string `json:\"signature\"` Time  string `json:\"time\"`}Chaincode FunctionsFollowing the best practice, we do not define the Init(). And inside Invoke(), we define two functions: queryDocRecord() and createDocRecord().func (s *SmartContract) Init(APIstub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) sc.Response { return shim.Success(nil)}func (s *SmartContract) Invoke(APIstub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) sc.Response {// Retrieve the requested Smart Contract function and arguments function, args := APIstub.GetFunctionAndParameters() // Route to the appropriate handler function to interact with the ledger appropriately if function == \"queryDocRecord\" {  return s.queryDocRecord(APIstub, args) } else if function == \"createDocRecord\" {  return s.createDocRecord(APIstub, args) }return shim.Error(\"Invalid Smart Contract function name.\")}In createDocRecord(), we are expecting two parameters, the hash of a document and the document signature by the owner (the computation of hash and signature are outside the chaincode). When recorded in the ledger, the hash is the key, while the document signature and timestamp is the value of this key.func (s *SmartContract) createDocRecord(APIstub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface, args []string) sc.Response {if len(args) != 2 {  return shim.Error(\"Incorrect number of arguments. Expecting 2\") }var docrecord = DocRecord{Signature: args[1], Time: time.Now().Format(time.RFC3339)} docrecordAsBytes, _ := json.Marshal(docrecord) APIstub.PutState(args[0], docrecordAsBytes)return shim.Success(nil)}In queryDocRecord(), we are expecting one parameter, which is the hash of a document. With this hash as key, the record in the ledger is retrieved.func (s *SmartContract) queryDocRecord(APIstub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface, args []string) sc.Response {if len(args) != 1 {  return shim.Error(\"Incorrect number of arguments. Expecting 1\") }docrecordAsBytes, _ := APIstub.GetState(args[0])if docrecordAsBytes == nil {  return shim.Error(\"Document not found: \" + args[0]) }return shim.Success(docrecordAsBytes)}Client ApplicationNow it is the client application. We totally have four client applications for this application.enrollAdmin.jsThis one is directly taken from fabcar example without modification.The purpose is to enrol an admin user to the Fabric CA of Basic Network. This admin will later register user for our demo.After enrollment, the admin (and other users as well) will have a directory created inside docrec/wallet directory. Inside the wallet there are signing key and X509 certificate issued by Fabric CA. They will be used on other client applications.If admin already exists in the docrec/wallet, no further action is needed.Meanwhile, per the Basic Network setup, the Fabric CA will have all the things \u201chardcoded\u201d. As long as we do not modify the crypto detail on Basic Network, we can enrol the admin once, and use the admin wallet for the whole demo.$ node enrollAdmin.jsregisterUser.jsThe application is mainly adapted from fabcar example with modification. The original fabcar example creates a wallet for \u2018user1\u2019 (hardcoded). Since we need multiple users, we will add a username when using this application.The purpose is to register a user by admin, and then a user can enroll the Fabric CA, that is, collect the signing key and X509 certificate. Like admin user, each user will have its own wallet, stored under docrec/wallet directory.Similarly, as long as Basic Network setup is not modified, we can generate once these users and use for demo any time after.$ node registerUser.js <username>// examples$ node registerUser.js alice$ node registerUser.js bobaddDocByFile.jsThe purpose of this application is to record the document in this notarization application.The input parameters areuser: From the wallet of user user\u2019s signing key is retrieved.

One\u2019s certificate should be public available and the subject is the identify of the certificate owner.$ node addDocByFile.js <any_user> <filename> <usercert>// example$ node validateDocByFile.js alice alicefile alicecert$ node validateDocByFile.js admin bobfile bobcertCodesHere are the codes of chaincode and several client applications.chaincodeenrollAdmin.js is adapted from fabric-samples/fabcarregisterUser.js is adapted from fabric-samples/fabcarDemonstrationThe demo setup is built on Basic Network from fabric-samples. It is a single-organization single-peer setup with one order and one Fabric CA. Commands are issued through CLI. It is good enough to show how the application works.On this Basic Network a channel mychannel is created, and the peer joins the channel. After that the chaincode docrec.go is installed and instantiated.After that client applications are used to interact with the chaincode.The demonstration setupStep 1: Create Project DirectoryCreate a project directory under fabric-samples. (The demo code contains relative directory structure. Therefore make sure it is on the right directory.)# inside fabric-samples$ mkdir docrec && cd docrecStep 2: Load the Required PackagesBesides Fabric SDK, we also needs handling X509 certificate and cryptography.# inside fabric-samples/docrec$ npm init -y$ npm install fabric-ca-client fabric-network crypto-js jsrsasign -SStep 3: ChaincodeFor demo purpose, we place the chaincode under fabric-samples/chaincode directory. This directory is accessible in the running containers of basic-network.# inside fabric-samples/chaincode$ mkdir docrec && cd docrec$ <put the docrec.go file here>After we should be able to see the chaincode file in this directory.Step 4: Client ApplicationThere are total four client applications to be used. We simply put them in fabric-samples/docrec directory.# inside fabric-samples/docrec$ <put the four files enrollAdmin.js, registerUser.js, addDocByFile.js and validateDocByFile.js>After we should be able to see the four client application files in this directory.Step 5: Bring Up Basic NetworkBring up Basic Network and check if all five containers are up and running. After that the Basic Network is up and running with a channel mychannel is created and the peer node joins the channel.# inside fabric-samples/basic-network$ ./start.sh && docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d cli$ docker psCheck all five containers are up and running.Step 6: Install and Instantiate docrec ChaincodeAfter Basic Network is up and running, we can work on the chaincode installation and instantiation.# any directory$ docker exec cli peer chaincode install -n docrec -v 1.0 -p \"github.com/docrec\"$ docker exec cli peer chaincode instantiate -o orderer.example.com:7050 -C mychannel -n docrec -v 1.0 -c '{\"Args\":[]}' -P \"OR ('Org1MSP.member')\"Step 7: Enrol admin as Admin (if not yet)Use enrollAdmin.js to enrol an admin. If admin is in docrec/wallet, it is already enrolled and it will be used later.# inside fabric-samples/docrec$ node enrollAdmin.js$ ls walletStep 8: Register Users alice and bob, and Enrol them as Users (if not yet)Use registerUser.js to enrol users alice and bob. If they are already in the docrec/wallet, they are already enrolled and can be used later.# inside fabric-samples/docrec$ node registerUser.js alice$ node registerUser.js bob$ ls walletStep 9: Extract Certificate from alice and bobWe later needs the certificate from alice and bob for signature validation. The certificate can be found inside their wallets. The directory is docrec/wallets/alice/alice.# inside fabric-samples/docrec$ cat wallet/alice/alice$ cat wallet/bob/bobUse any editor to extract them and keep them into two files: alicecert and bobcert.Here is how alicecert looks like.This is just for alicecert. Do the same for bobcert from bob\u2019s wallet.Step 10: Create two files for demonstrationCreate two files for demonstration.# inside fabric-sample/docrec$ echo \"This is a test file for alice\" > alicefile$ echo \"This is another test file for bob\" > bobfileStep 11: Add Files in the Notarization ApplicationNow we have all files ready for demonstration. We will use addDocByFile.js to add alicefile by alice, and bobfile by bob.# inside fabric-sample/docrec$ node addDocByFile.js alice alicefile$ node addDocByFile.js bob bobfileFrom the response we see the transaction is successfully submitted.Step 12: Validate Files in the Notarization ApplicationWe can use validateDocByFile.js to validate files with the certificates.We first validate alicefile with alicecert, and bobfile with bobcert. Both should work. Meanwhile, we need to specify the user as someone issues this query, but it is not relevant in the validation process. As an example, we just use alice as the query issuer.# inside fabric-sample/docrec$ node validateDocByFile.js alice alicefile alicecert$ node validateDocByFile.js alice bobfile bobcertIn both case we see positive result (true).Next we validate with wrong certificate.# inside fabric-sample/docrec$ node validateDocByFile.js alice alicefile bobcert$ node validateDocByFile.js alice bobfile alicecertAnd we see negative result.Meanwhile, some detail of certificate provided is given in each validation. We can further consider whether this certificate is acceptable or not (e.g. whether it is from a trusted issuer, whether the subject names are correct, whether the certificate has expired, etc.)Finally we validate a file that is not submitted before.# inside fabric-sample/docrec$ echo \"File not recorded\" > nofile$ node validateDocByFile.js alice nofile alicecertDocument not found in this query.Step 13: Teardown the DemonstrationAfter demonstration, we will tear down the whole Basic Network setup. The scripts stop and remove containers and image created during the demonstration.Note all file record in the ledger is removed. The wallets are still there, and next time when perform demonstration, they don\u2019t need created again (i.e. Step 7 and 8 can be skipped).ClosingIn this exercise we have built a notarization application for recording the ownership of documents on a fabric network. Although the application is demonstrated in Basic Network, it should work fine with a proper setup of a fabric network.This setup is for demonstration purpose and therefore the applications are not optimized and no user interface is developed. Nevertheless, it shows how to leverage the identity management with X509 for individual user as ownership of any document. It can be further evolved to become a useable application for a larger population, such as a user interface to register and enrol the CA and collect the certificate in their own wallet, select their wallet for signing document, etc.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Hyperledger Fabric", "Notarization", "Chaincode", "Tutorial"]}, {"title": "Identity in Hyperledger Fabric (Part 2)", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@kctheservant/identity-in-hyperledger-fabric-part-2-fc2f50214d9?source=search_post", "author_name": "KC Tam", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@kctheservant", "publish_date": "2019-06-20", "last_modified_date": "2019-06-20", "readtime": "12.4", "claps": 90, "voters": 14, "content": "Identity in Hyperledger Fabric (Part 2)KC TamFollowJun 20 \u00b7 13 min readOverviewIn the previous article I have described how identity is implemented in Hyperledger Fabric and shown how to access control inside chaincode based on the identity (digital certificate). In this article we will continue our journey.We first take a look on the cryptogen tool, and what are generated with a proper configuration file. Instead of generating the required amount of user certificates with cryptogen, a better way is to use Fabric-CA. We take a bit deep-dive into how the Fabric-CA is configured, and then issue a user certificate through fabric SDK. Finally, we again use Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) to limit only those entity with proper attribute can invoke some part of chaincode.Setup a New NetworkLet\u2019s first setup a directory based on the configuration files in Basic Network. We name the directory myNetwork.cd fabric-samplesmkdir myNetworkcd myNetworkHere I put it under fabric-samples. The commands below and in docker-compose file later will match this directory design. In case you are using another directory, please make change accordingly.First we copy the most important three files from Basic Network.cp ../basic-network/crypto-config.yaml .cp ../basic-network/configtx.yaml .cp ../basic-network/docker-compose.yml .We will first work on crypto-config.yaml.Use cryptogen to Generate Crypto MaterialConfiguration File crypto-config.yamlHere is what we see the configuration file from the Basic Network setup: one orderer organization and one peer organization Org1, with one peer node defined in Org1.OrdererOrgs:  - Name: Orderer    Domain: example.com    Specs:      - Hostname: ordererPeerOrgs:  - Name: Org1    Domain: org1.example.com    Template:      Count: 1    Users:      Count: 1When we generate the crypto material based on this configuration file,../bin/cryptogen generate --config=./crypto-config.yamlWe will have a directory structure under crypto-config directory.Directory structure of crypto-config/Let\u2019s focus on Peers Organization. In fact Orderer Organization looks almost the same but simpler.Relate the crypto-config.yaml file to the directory structureAll peer-related material is under peersOrganizations directory. In our setup we only have one organization, org1.example.com. If we have more organizations defined under PeerOrgs in configuration file, they will appear as different directories.Inside org1.example.com, we have several directories. The ones we are interested in are ca, users and peers.In ca directory, it is where the root certificate and signing key of the Certificate Authority (CA) for org1.example.com. All certificates inside org1.example.com are issued and signed by this CA.In users directory, it contains all users under org1.example.com. The first one Admin@org1.example.com is created by system. We see there is another User1@org1.example.com. It is created when we specify Users: Count: 1 in the configuration file. If we need more, we just change the number and more users will be created. Inside Admin and the users, there is a standard msp directory.In peers directory, it contains all the peer node under org1.example.com. The number of peers created is specified in the Template: Count: 1 in the configuration file. Change this number if we need more peer node for Org1. The peer node is designated as peern.org1.example.com, where n is 0, 1, etc. Inside each peer node, there is a standard msp directory.Finally, msp directory under peers or users has a similar directory structure. Here are the directories we are interested in,cacerts: the CA certificate of org1.example.com, that is, ca.org1.example.com-cert.pem.keystore: the signkey of the entity (user or peer node)signcerts: the certificate of the entity (user or peer node)Certificates at a GlanceWe take a look on those certificates using openssl.ca.org1.example.com, which is a self-sign certificate, serving as the root CA in org1.example.com.Admin@org1.example.com-cert.pem: the certificate of Admin, issued to Admin and signed by the CA above.User1@org1.example.com-cert.pem: similar to the one for Admin.And finally peer0.org1.example.com-cert.pem: it is the certificate of peer0. Again it is issued and signed by CA.Revisit cryptogenFrom the above we observe that the tool cryptogen has created the required crypto material based on the configuration file specified.If we zoom in an organization, cryptogen has created a self-signed certificate, acting as the certificate authority of the organization which issues digital certificate to all entities, including peer nodes and users, defined in the organization.When we take a look on the cryptogen tool, we see several options. Besides the generate command, we can also use showtemplate to show the default template, and see how we can construct the configuration file to meet our requirement (e.g. change the Issuer of CA, add Subject Alternative Names , etc.)While we use cryptogen to generate the crypto material for our network, it is only good for a demo setup. In real production it is not the desired way, becausethe tool should not be run by any except authorized personnel,the tool may be able to add more users but the process is not clear, andthe tool lacks the flexibility to add attributes on user certificates, which may be useful when we apply attribute-based access control (see later).In such a case, a better approach is to have a Certificate Authority which can issue certificates after the initial cryptogen is complete. Here Fabric-CA plays this role.Fabric-CAOverviewFabric-CA is the Certificate Authority tool developed by Hyperledger Fabric serving a CA role. Once up and running, Fabric-CA can issue new certificates with specific requirement on request. Fabric-CA can accessed using Fabric-CA Client or Fabric SDK, both from Hyperledger Fabric as well.Note that use of Fabric-CA is optional. If there is no need to add more user certificates for a fabric network, you do not need Fabric-CA. You simply use cryptogen mentioned above to generate the required amount of user certificates, and then distribute the certificates to the right entities.Or if your company already has a CA server established, you can use your own CA server instead. The \u201chow-to\u201d incorporate your enterprise CA into Hyperledger Fabric is beyond the scope of this article. We simply use cryptogen first and establish a Fabric-CA server with the crypto material.Examine Fabric-CA Setup in Basic NetworkAs we mentioned in last article, Basic-Network in fabric-sample comes with a Fabric-CA container. The setup is inside the docker-compose file.If we take a look on the ca portion basic-network/docker-compose.yml, here we seeca.example.com:    image: hyperledger/fabric-ca    environment:      - FABRIC_CA_HOME=/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server      - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CA_NAME=ca.example.com      - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CA_CERTFILE=/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server-config/ca.org1.example.com-cert.pem      - FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CA_KEYFILE=/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server-config/4239aa0dcd76daeeb8ba0cda701851d14504d31aad1b2ddddbac6a57365e497c_sk    ports:      - \"7054:7054\"    command: sh -c 'fabric-ca-server start -b admin:adminpw'    volumes:      - ./crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/ca/:/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server-config    container_name: ca.example.com    networks:      - basicHere is the observationAfter we run docker-compose with this file, a ca.example.com container running fabric-ca image is instantiated.A local directory ./crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/ca is mapped to the directory /etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server-config. The directory is holding the ca signing key and signing certificate of the CA for Org1 (see directory structure discussion in the session above).And these two files are defined in environment variables: FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CA_CERTFILE and FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CA_KEYFILE. The crypto material generated by cryptogen is now configured in the Fabric-CA.ca.example.com exposes port 7054 for accessing.Finally the command to star the Fabric-CA is sh -c \u2018fabric-ca-server start -b admin:adminpw\u2019. The -b is the bootstrap identity. We will use it when we enrol the admin and users later.With this setup, Fabric-CA is running. Digital certificates can be issued to a new entity later.Bring Up our SetupLet\u2019s continue with our workspace.And in order to bring up our network, we need to generate the correct configuration transaction first.// inside fabric-sample/myNetworkexport FABRIC_CFG_PATH=$PWDmkdir config../bin/configtxgen -profile OneOrgOrdererGenesis -outputBlock ./config/genesis.block../bin/configtxgen -profile OneOrgChannel -outputCreateChannelTx ./config/channel.tx -channelID mychannelWe will see the two files: genesis.block and channel.tx. They are good enough for our network.Finally modify the docker-compose.yml to reflect the CA we just generate. In particular, update the signing key variable to use our own signing key. Here is the signing key of CA.Update the environment variable in docker-compose fileFABRIC_CA_SERVER_CA_KEYFILE=/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server-config/7bb3855c7cb680de8b1482a413e8e16be2fcea544ea395be6dd86171dbe9d067_skAlso a minor modification for our demonstration purposeinside the docker-compose.yml, uncomment the cli service \u201cdepends_on:\u201d and \u201cpeer0.org1.example.com\u201d and \u201ccouchdb\u201dcopy the .env from Basic Network: cp ../basic-network/.env .With this, we can bring up the containers.docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -dAnd we see the five containers are brought up and running.Observe Fabric-CA ContainerNow we can take a look what is inside the ca.example.com.docker exec -it ca.example.com bashWe first take a look on the command running:And the environment variablesThis Fabric-CA is up and running, able to issue certificates.Issue User CertificatesAs mentioned above, there are two ways to use the Fabric-CA. In this example, we are demonstrating the use the Javascript SDK.Instead of writing from scratch, we again leverage some existing examples in fabric-samples. The FabCar application (fabric-samples/fabcar/javascript) comes with two client application: enrollAdmin.js and registerUser.js. These applications use Fabric SDK. These files are for basic network and we modify them to fit our running CA.We begin with a copy of connection.json from basic-network to myNetwork. It contains the information our client application will use later.cd fabric-samplescp basic-network/connection.json myNetwork/Then we create a new directory: myApp inside fabric-samples.cd fabric-samplesmkdir myAppcd myAppWe will initialize our node environment and install the required SDK.npm init // accept all defaultnpm install fabric-ca-client \u2014 savenpm install fabric-network \u2014 saveNow we copy the two files from fabcar/javascript directory.cp ../fabcar/javascript/enrollAdmin.js .cp ../fabcar/javascript/registerUser.js .We first modify the two applications to reflect our directory. In both files, look for the line of const ccpPath, and change it to our directory.const ccpPath = path.resolve(__dirname, '..', 'myNetwork', 'connection.json');Now let\u2019s take a quick look on these two applications and see how it works.Now let\u2019s take a quick look on these two applications and see how it works.enrollAdmin.js: this application is to enrol an administrator on our CA. Here is the logic.Load the required modules from fabric-ca-client and fabric-network.Retrieve the detail about the myNetwork deployment. It is used for obtaining the access point of Fabric CA.Check whether \u201cadmin\u201d is already inside the wallet directory. If so, no further action is needed.Enrol the admin user to the Fabric CA with enrollment ID and Secret (aligned with what is defined in Fabric CA, see ca.example.com service in the docker-compose file myNetwork/docker-compose.yml).The result of enrollment is key pair and certificate. The result is then stored in wallet/admin/.registerUser.js: the application is to let admin register and enrol a user. Here is the logic.Load the required modules from fabric-network.Retrieve the detail about the myNetwork deployment.Check whether user1 is already enrolled. If so no further action is needed.Check whether admin is here. If admin is not yet enrolled, prompt for enrollAdmin.js and no further action is needed.Create a new gateway connecting to peer, with connection detail from myNetwork deployment.Register the user1 with admin created in previous part. The result is a secret.Now we can enrol the user1 with the secret.The result of enrollment is key pair and certificate for user1. The result is then stored in wallet/user1/.To enroll the adminnode enrollAdmin.jsWe will see wallet/admin directory, and the certificate is inside the file admin.Now admin registers user1, and enrol user1node registerUser.jsThe JSON files (admin or user) are the format the SDK can use later. If you are developing client application, you can read this JSON file. In our demonstration, we are using CLI to interact with chaincode later. We need to extract the certificate and signing key in later part of session.Finally, we will take a look on the certificate inside the JSON files. I extract them and create a PEM file before reading them into detail.The admin certificateThe user1 certificateWe see that both certificates are issued by the same CA. Besides, the subjects on both certificates reflects what is configured in the client applications.In particular, there is an entry of attributes in the user1 certificate. Three attributes are defined:hf.Affiliation: org1.department1hf.EnrollmentID: user1hf.Type: clientThe information comes from the code in registerUser.js. We can specify the required attributes when register a user.const secret = await ca.register({ affiliation: 'org1.department1', enrollmentID: 'user1', role: 'client' }, adminIdentity);const enrollment = await ca.enroll({ enrollmentID: 'user1', enrollmentSecret: secret });These two lines of code represents the two steps:When the CA registers user1, it has specified the affiliation, enrollment id and the role. The result is a secret for user1. This information is stored inside CA.Using this secret, CA enrols user1. From the secret specified, CA will prepare the certificate for user1, and inside which the attributes mentioned above are included with the value specified in the step 1 (registration).Complete the Setup with Channel CreationSo far we only bring up all the required containers for myNetwork. Before we move forward into the chaincode portion, we need to create the channel mychannel first and make peer0.org1.example.com join the channel. Here are the commands.docker exec -e \"CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org1MSP\" -e \"CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/etc/hyperledger/msp/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp\" peer0.org1.example.com peer channel create -o orderer.example.com:7050 -c mychannel -f /etc/hyperledger/configtx/channel.txdocker exec -e \"CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org1MSP\" -e \"CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/etc/hyperledger/msp/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp\" peer0.org1.example.com peer channel join -b mychannel.blockAttribute Based Access Control (ABAC)Finally we reach the topic we promise in last article. ABAC provides a chaincode level access control by examining the digital certificate of transaction requester (invoker). The Client Identity Chaincode Library provides the methods to obtain useful information from the digital certificate.In the previous article, we have shown how to get the subject in X509 certificate and check whether it is a specific user. This time we will inspect the attributes of a digital certificate and again make sure the certificate contains a specific attribute and a value before the transaction is being accepted and processed by the fabric network.Prepare the Chaincode SACC-ABACWe use the same code in previous article for demonstration. But this time, the checking logic is not on the Subject of invoker\u2019s Digital Certificate. Instead, we will check if the attribute hf.Affiliation has a value org1.department1 or not.First we create another chaincode sacc-abaccd fabric-samples/chaincodecp -r abac/ sacc-abac/cp sacc/sacc.go sacc-abac/go/sacc-abac.gocd sacc-abac/gorm abac.goNow modify the two parts in sacc-abac.go.import portionimport (\"fmt\"\"github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim/ext/cid\"\"github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim\"\"github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/peer\")set() portionfunc set(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface, args []string) (string, error) {  // only user with org1.department1 affiliation can set the value department1err := cid.AssertAttributeValue(stub, \"hf.Affiliation\", \"org1.department1\") if department1err != nil {  return \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"Only Department 1 can set value.\") } ... original code ...}Now we install and instantiate the chaincode. It is done in CLI, and by default by Admin@org1.example.com.docker exec cli peer chaincode install -n sacc -v 0 -p github.com/sacc-abac/godocker exec cli peer chaincode instantiate -n sacc -v 0 -C mychannel -c '{\"Args\":[\"a\", \"100\"]}'Create a New User for Chaincode AccessRemember we have already created two users using cryptogen tool? They are Admin@org1.example.com and User1@org1.example.com. Both do not have the affiliation attribute set. We will create one new user, called user1fromCA, with proper msp structure such that CLI can use it when invoking in chaincode.If we take a look on the volume mapping on CLI again (docker-compose.yml), we see the crypto-config directory in our local host is mapped to crypto inside CLI. Therefore, the easiest way is to create one more user user1fromCA manually, with proper msp structure and content.cd myNetwork/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/cp -r User1@org1.example.com/ user1fromCANow we have user1fromCA directory structure. The components we need to modify aremsp/admincerts: change it to the certificate in wallet/user1/user1 in PEM formatmsp/signcerts: change it to our certificate in wallet/user1/user1 in PEM format (same as admincerts)msp/keystore: change it to wallet/user1/xxx-privInvoke ChaincodeWe first get value from chaincode. As there is no access control, we can get it by any user.docker exec cli peer chaincode invoke -n sacc -C mychannel -c '{\"Args\":[\"get\", \"a\"]}'But when we try to set a value, and using the default Admin@org1.example.com in CLI, we will get error.docker exec cli peer chaincode invoke -n sacc -C mychannel -c '{\"Args\":[\"set\", \"a\", \"500\"]}'And we see the error message we defined in the chaincode.Finally we are using user1fromCA to set the value.docker exec -e \"CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/user1fromCA/msp\" cli peer chaincode invoke -n sacc -C mychannel -c '{\"Args\":[\"set\", \"a\", \"500\"]}'The update is successful.SummaryWe have walked through both the cryptogen tool and the Fabric-CA, and see the difference between them. Cryptogen is good for demo or static setup, while Fabric-CA provides a better way to issue certificates in real life. Also, with Fabric-CA we can issue certificate with specific attributes and values. These can be used in chaincode access control with attribute-based access control (ABAC) capability in Hyperledger Fabric.Hope you find this and previous article helpful.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Hyperledger Fabric", "Identity", "Fabric Ca", "Permissioned Blockchains", "Digital Certificates"]}, {"title": "HSN Protector Master Node Program", "post_link": "https://medium.com/hyperspeednetwork/hsn-protector-master-node-program-11240b5a0f86?source=search_post", "author_name": "Hyper Speed Network", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@hyperspeednetwork2019", "publish_date": "2019-08-13", "last_modified_date": "2019-09-07", "readtime": "6.24", "claps": 51, "voters": 2, "content": "HSN Protector Master Node ProgramHyper Speed NetworkFollowAug 13 \u00b7 7 min read5 Million HSN Reward and Giveaway EventNOTE: HSN Wallet Download Link: https://invite.pmn.hsn.link/download.htmlWith the accelerated development of 5G technology and the coming of the 5G era, as the first value ecosystem combining Public Chain + 5G application in the world, Hyper Speed Network (HSN) is also increasing the speed of research, development and promotion.

He has led Leybold to establish strong startup- and industrial partnerships such as the development of the Hyperloop, a project imagined by Elon Musk.Hello Carl Brockmeyer. You are are the Head of Business Development at Leybold. What is your story? How did you end up there?I joined the Oerlikon Group in 2007 as a global management trainee. Since then I had the opportunity to work with several business units of the group, such as Oerlikon Space, a manufacturer of high-precision mechanisms for satellites and space-crafts as well as the payload fairings for all Ariane rockets. (Oerlikon Space was sold to RUAG Space in 2009). Later I joined Oerlikon Textile, the largest manufacturer of Textile machines and have gone through several responsibilities therein, mostly in areas of Finance and Operations, before I got a call to come and join the Oerlikon Leybold Vacuum business unit as their CFO in China and Taiwan. Two years into that role it was clear for me that I had to leave the Finance sector and focus more on strategy and sales of the business and jumped at the opportunity to lead the global business development of Leybold. As such I am responsible for all organic and inorganic growth strategies for the business. The organic part includes strategies to enter new markets, new regions, new applications for our products and services as well as new business models and sales channels. The inorganic strategy arm represents the traditional corporate development part of the business with responsibilities for all M&A activities, joint ventures and strategic partnerships. In 2016 this entailed the sale of Oerlikon Leybold Vacuum to the Swedish Atlas Copco Group, where since September 2016 the business is now continued under the new brand Leybold.How would you explain the products that Leybold is developing to people who don\u2019t know anything about vacuum systems?A vacuum or at least partial vacuum is required for nearly every modern production process and R&D activity. Our core competencies center on the development of application- and customer specific systems for the creation of vacuums and extraction of process gases. Fields of application are coating technologies, thin-films and data storage, analytical instruments and traditional industrial processes. For example \u2014 there would be no efficient space research on earth, if scientists couldn\u2019t test their satellite and rocket systems in a vacuum chamber in a laboratory environment, powered by our vacuum pumps.This is a far extreme on the pressure scale and an application that requires a near perfect vacuum. More towards the other extreme on the pressure scale, packaged food in supermarkets require vacuum technology as vacuum packaged food has an increased shelf-life. Between these two extremes of applications, our products are used for many different food and beverage production and packaging processes, the degassing of steel to enhance its material capabilities or the energy efficient melting of titanium under vacuum. The coating of architectural glass but also the coating of every single sunglass and optical lense and even the coating of mirrors and headlights of your car require vacuum technology. The production of solar panels, mobile phone displays and OLED television sets is all done under vacuum to ensure particle free environments during the coating process. CERN in Switzerland uses Leybold\u2019s vacuum technology on its Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and several other experiments to research the fundamental structure of the universe.You developed products for renewable energy uses. Can you talk about it?Leybold\u2019s vacuum pumps and systems are required for multiple steps of Li-Ion battery production, such as the filling of electrolytes, degassing of battery cells, the stacking and packaging of battery cells or the leak-detection of assembled batteries. The development of new of solar panel technologies as well as their production also requires our vacuum pumps and we have developed a specific product line for efficient solar cell production which is used at many of the prominent solar cell manufacturers in the industry. The production and assembly process of wind-mills also requires vacuum technology, especially for composite made wings and pylons.Are you currently working on new products or projects?Of course, all the time. Innovations are part of our business model. We don\u2019t develop typical end-user products. Instead, our products are used for production processes and R&D processes of our customers, which continuously develop a new pipeline of products and more efficient technologies. This constantly requires improved and more efficient vacuum pumps to enable the production processes of our customers. Hence, we in turn have to reinvent ourselves through new products and redefine the status quo of our products\u2019 possibilities.Can you talk to us about Elon Musk\u2019s pipe dream, the Hyperloop. What is it exactly? How does it work?Hyperloop is devised as a fifth mode of transportation besides the well-known modes cars, airplanes, trains and boats. It has the potential to replace short and medium distances of today\u2019s air and train travel with significant gains on overall efficiency, energy consumption and total cost of ownership. Imagine a large tube, which is immune to weather conditions and operates with a low pressure environment inside, a partial vacuum. Inside the tube, people and goods are transported in capsules (or pods), which hover magnetically and are driven by electro-magnetic propulsion. The low pressure environment inside the tube enables high speeds and an energy efficient propulsion, as air inside the tube, or the same system outside the tube, would be slowed down by air drag.How is it going to revolutionize transportation?Most of today\u2019s public transportation systems are cost-inefficient, many can only operate on government subsidies. Only few of the train tracks in Germany for example are profit making, for which most connections depend on subsidies from the government, despite the high ticket prices. This is largely due to the high cost to build these systems and high costs to operate and maintain them throughout their lifecycle. This is true for most developed countries.Hyperloop proposes a technology and along with it a business model that aims to be significantly cheaper to build than today\u2019s high-speed train systems and more importantly aims to be cheaper in its operation and maintenance. This would allow operators of the Hyperloop to actually earn a profit to reinvest. This is important if we want to further develop and innovate transportation systems, and for the same reason, this is probably why we haven\u2019t seen real innovation e.g. on train transportation in the last 100 years. Yes, trains became faster, cleaner and more energy efficient, and of course the likes of Siemens, ABB and Bombardier are putting great efforts into their train developments, but in fact most of today\u2019s trains are evolved versions of older train systems and we have not seen a real disruptive innovation of the train system since its inception. The Hyperloop proposes to do just that, disrupt and revolutionize transportation through a sustainable, energy- and cost-efficient technology.Another aspect of the Hyperloop to revolutionize transportation is its speed. If you could work in a city that is 600km far away from your home town and cover that distance in less than an hour in a cost-efficient way with the Hyperloop, than the importance of location changes entirely. You could visit the opera or a restaurant hundreds of kilometers away and be back home for bedtime.In which stage of the research and development are you today? Did you make the first tests?As a pioneer in vacuum technology, we provide a key technology to the Hyperloop which is ready for full-scale operation. The technology itself is ready to be built and there are several projects ongoing already, such as in Slovakia and Abu-Dhabi. The challenge does not lie with the realization of the Hyperloop, but its further optimization. We need to make sure that the Hyperloop is not built only once, like the Transrapid, but that the system and its operational concept are optimized in such way that it can repeatedly built and that it remains a profit-making business model.How much energy is required to travel in this futuristic vacuum tube? And where does the energy come from?Renewable energy is key for the Hyperloop business model. The Hyperloop is devised as an ecosystem, incl. sources of renewable energy, too. As such, Hyperloop tubes could be plastered with solar panels. Wind and geothermal energy could be sourced along the tracks and within the tubes themselves, regenerative energy sourced from the electric propulsion and breaking system will play a key-role, too. While I cannot disclose specifics on the energy consumption publicly yet, I can say that one of the targets is to generate more energy with the Hyperloop ecosystem, than it will consume during its operation.I\u2019ve read that 400 people were working on the project. Not employees, but women and men who work with the NASA, Boeing, and SpaceX, and decided to spend their spare time on Hyperloop in exchange for stock options. This is amazing. Where does this idea come from and how does it work so far?Only at Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) alone, there are more than 600 contributors in the meantime. And there are other prominent companies and projects pursuing concepts of the Hyperloop, too. As more companies and even universities of different disciplines pursue the concept, the Hyperloop becomes a real movement, not just a technology dream. We have seen architectural and industrial design courses focusing an entire semester on developing Hyperloop concepts and many of the worldwide leading engineering universities are participating in a Hyperloop competition with SpaceX.While there are many viable ways to approach developing and building a Hyperloop, HTT\u2019s way is truly amazing and a very unique way to build and run a company, yes. The idea follows a mix of crowd-innovation and crowd-collaboration. HTT incorporated itself following a crowd initiative on a crowd-collaboration platform. Key functions in the organization work full-time by now, but the majority still works as external contributor, like we do at Leybold. It would be difficult to hire all required talent and resources alone for all the vacuum know-how required to develop and build theHyperloop. One could of course hire away the top 15\u201320 required talents from Leybold and for all other disciplines required, but it still would not provide the support and know-how from Leybold\u2019s more than 1.600+ global workforce that the core team around the Hyperloop can rely on. This way HTT can allow for the \u201cbest able\u201d and not only the \u201cbest available\u201d to join and contribute.Interview by Anne-Sophie Garrigou", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Elon Musk", "Interviews", "Transportation", "Climate Change", "Future"]}, {"title": "Transactions in Hyperledger Fabric", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@kctheservant/transactions-in-hyperledger-fabric-50e068dda8a9?source=search_post", "author_name": "KC Tam", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@kctheservant", "publish_date": "2019-07-22", "last_modified_date": "2019-07-22", "readtime": "11.9", "claps": 40, "voters": 11, "content": "Transactions in Hyperledger FabricKC TamFollowJul 22 \u00b7 12 min readOverviewTransaction is an important element in Hyperledger Fabric. Transaction reflects the business activity upon the fabric network. To achieve data immutability transactions are kept inside blocks and protected through a chained structure. This is how the word blockchain comes from.In a fabric network each participating nodes (peers) keeps its own ledger, and through consensus mechanism the ledger keeps identical. The ledger is composed of two parts: a blockchain and a world state database. To inspect a transaction, the best way is to observe the blocks committed in a peer node. This is what the article is all about.We will covera simplified lifecycle of a transactionhow to read a block from the ledgerChannel Genesis Blockinstallation and instantiation of Fabcar chaincodewhat is inside a transactiontransactions after invoking chaincode functionsvarious actors (client, peer and orderer) in the transaction and block creationLifecycle of a TransactionHere is a diagram showing the basic lifecycle of a transaction: how it comes as a proposal from a client and ends up an endorsed transaction recorded in the ledger as a block.Client sends out a transaction proposal to the specified endorsing peer nodes (a.k.a. endorsers). Endorsers, confirming the client is valid to send transaction proposal, execute the chaincode according to information specified in the proposal and in world state. After execution they return the proposal response to the client. Inside the response is the simulation results done by that endorser, in terms of a Read Write Set (RWSet), which shows what is read from the world state and what is written back after the chaincode invoke. As an endorsement, endorsers signs the response.Note that at this stage nothing is changed on the ledger yet.The client, after obtaining the responses, validates them to make sure things work fine. If collected responses reach the required endorsing policy (for example, one peer is required from each organization), the client constructs a transaction and send to orderer. The transaction includes the transaction proposal, proposal response and endorsements.The orderer receives transaction(s) from the client(s) and validates them. Then orderer creates a block holding the validated transactions, and broadcasts this newly created block to all the peer nodes. Upon receiving this block, the peer node validates the block and executes the transaction inside the block, which will update the world state according to the content in Read Write Set (RWSet). This block is now committed in each peer node as a valid block.Basic Network and Fabcar ChaincodeWe use the Basic Network for our demonstration. The Basic Network is found in fabric-samples/basic-network. When up and running, there is one organization Org1, a peer node peer0.org1.example.com, and an order node orderer.example.com.We do not need to generate the crypto material and channel artifacts: they are generated already with a channel mychannel. For sake of simplicity we use them directly.Fabcar chaincode comes in fabric-samples/chaincode. It is a simple database recording car detail and ownership. Fabcar chaincode is coded such that,Nothing is done during chaincode instantiation.After instantiation, Invoke initLedger(), which writes 10 pre-set car records for demonstration.Each car is indexed as CAR#: from CAR0 to CAR9 for 10 car records. All detail of a car is placed into JSON format, stringified and placed in the ledger.There are several functions defined for invoking chaincode. Among them we will use changeCarOwner() and queryCar(). The former changes the owner record of a car, while the latter will get back the latest.You can have a more detail picture on this article about Fabcar.Deep-Dive into FabCar: Part 1A Complete Application Example on Hyperledger Fabricmedium.comThe Demo FlowHere is the flow of the demonstration.Run basic-network/start.sh to bring up all containers and join the peer0.org1 to mychannel. Channel genesis block (Block #0) is generated.Install Fabcar chaincode. No new block is created.Instantiate Fabcar chaincode in mychannel. Block #1 is generated.Invoke Fabcar function initLedger(). Block #2 is generated.Invoke Fabcar function changeCarOwner() on CAR0. Block #3 is generated.Invoke Fabcar function queryCar() on CAR0. Block #4 is generated.How to Read Block in a LedgerOver the demo, we obtain the block using the following steps. They work both in the peer node directly and CLI when it is configured properly pointing to a peer node.Get the blockchain information from the ledgerdocker exec [container] peer channel getinfo -c [channel_name]It comes back with the height of blockchain and the block hash of current block and previous block. Block is numbered from zero (Channel Genesis Block). Therefore the blocks available for examination is from block 0 to height-1.To get the block from the ledgerdocker exec [container] peer channel fetch [block_number] -c [channel_name]A file is saved with name [channel_name]_[block_number].block. For example, mychannel_0.block. This file is not readable and conversion is needed.As the file is still in the container (peer node or CLI), we copy it out to my localhost.docker cp [container]:[path of .block file] .And then we convert the block file to JSON format such that we can examine the detail inside.../bin/configtxgen -inspectBlock [.block file] > [.block.JSON]All the block files shown in JSON in this article are generated in this way.Channel Genesis BlockWhere does Channel Genesis Block come from?We are using the pre-generated channel artifacts in Basic Network. Here we first see a file genesis.block, which is inside ./configtx directory.This file is generated by using bin/configtxgen with the configuration configtx.yaml and proper profile. It will be loaded in Orderer node when the node is coming up.Note that this genesis.block file is NOT the Channel Genesis Block. This genesis.block file (blue in colour in the diagram below) is a generic one and from which Channel Genesis Block of all channels in a fabric network are created. Each channel has its own ledger. That is to say, each channel as its own blockchain and world state, and therefore each channel has its own Channel Genesis Block (Block #0).Here is the relationship.Each channel has its own Genesis Block, which is generated from the genesis.block file in Orderer.For each channel, we need a channel transaction to build the Channel Genesis Block from the genesis.block in the Orderer node. All the channel-specific information is built inside this channel transaction. In our demo, inside config directory, we have these two files: genesis.block and channel.tx.The generation of Channel Genesis Block for mychannel is done by the script basic-network/start.sh. The command to create Channel is,docker exec -e \"CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org1MSP\" -e \"CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/etc/hyperledger/msp/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp\" peer0.org1.example.com peer channel create -o orderer.example.com:7050 -c mychannel -f /etc/hyperledger/configtx/channel.txThis peer channel create command runs inside the peer0.org1.example.com container. We can see in the command we need to specify the Orderer, the channel name mychannel, and the channel transaction file (channel.tx).The result is a block file, mychannel.block. And we use the peer channel join to join peer0.org1.example.com to mychannel.docker exec -e \"CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org1MSP\" -e \"CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/etc/hyperledger/msp/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp\" peer0.org1.example.com peer channel join -b mychannel.blockThis is the result of running basic-network/start.sh. We see the containers are up and running, and the channel mychannel is created and peer node joins the channel.Currently the height of blockchain is 1, which means only the Channel Genesis Block (Block #0) is there.Blockchain height is 1Observe Channel Genesis Block: Block #0This is the Block #0, with some items collapsed.Here is some observation:In each block, there are three parts: header, data and metadata.In the Block Header, the previous hash (prev_hash) is null. This is the Channel Genesis Block (Block #0) and thus no previous block.The Block Data is where transactions are kept. In Channel Genesis Block it contains the configuration transaction. We will not go into detail on this Channel Genesis Block as it contains more concepts out of the purpose of this article. But we will inspect this area in the upcoming blocks.The Block Metadata contains information about this block. Again we are not exploring this in this article.Install and Instantiate Fabcar ChaincodeChaincode InstallationNote the chaincode installation does not involve transaction. It is just packaging the chaincode into a peer node. Therefore we will not see any new block created after this command.This can be done on CLI container.docker exec cli peer chaincode install -n fabcar -v 1.0 -p github.com/fabcar/goIf we check the height of mychannel ledger it is still 1, that is, only one block (block #0) is in the ledger.No new block created in chaincode installation.Chaincode InstantiationNow it\u2019s time for chaincode Instantiation, which a transaction is required. In chaincode instantiation, it is the function Init() being executed by endorser. Note that in Fabcar chaincode Init() is empty and requires no arguments,docker exec cli peer chaincode instantiate -o orderer.example.com:7050 -C mychannel -n fabcar -v 1.0 -c '{\"Args\":[]}' -P \"OR ('Org1MSP.member')\"The height now it is 2, which means we have a new block (Block #1) appended in the blockchain.Blockchain height is 2. A new block is created.Blockchain StructureIf we place Block #0 and Block #1 side-by-side, we see similar block structure. Besides, in header of Block #1 we now see previous_hash (8B2cTc\u2026), which is the hash of Block #0 (not shown in Block #0). We can counter check this in the previous session (checking Block #0). Again, the current block hash (xx5uLY\u2026) is not found in Block #1. It only shows in previous_hash of Block #2.TransactionHere is the simplified illustration between a block and transactions.Inside Block Data there are transactions. In each transaction we roughly divide three portion.Transaction Proposal: a client sends this proposal to endorsing peer nodesEndorsements: endorsing peer nodes return with their own ID and signatureProposal Response: the result after endorsing peer nodes execute the requested chaincode, in the format of RWSetIf we take a look inside Block Data portion and zoom in, we will find out these three parts inside a transaction.Transaction ProposalDuring chaincode instantiation, the chaincode being used is lscc, or the Lifecycle System Chaincode. And there is an argument list. All data is base64 encoded. The decoded argument list is [\u201cdeploy\u201d, \u201cmychannel\u201d, \u201cfabcar 1.0\u201d, \u201cOrg1MSP\u201d, \u201cescc\u201d, \u201cvscc\u201d]. From the argument list we know it is related to the chaincode instantiation and endorsing policy. The escc and vscc are Endorsing System Chaincode and Validation System Chaincode, respectively. Both are the default if we have not specified during instantiation.Proposal Response and EndorsementWe see in proposal_response_payload, the results are the Read Write Set (RWSet). Here something is written to the key fabcar. The decoded value is more or less about some information after instantiation. Since we are not exploring lscc, we skip the detail here.In endorsements, the endorser is the ID of peer0.org1.example.com, and it contains the signature by this endorser on this response.Invoke Various Chaincode FunctionsHere we follow our demo flow by invoking three functions. In each invoke we will see a new block is created. We will examine the transaction included in the block, and the interaction of world state.Invoke initLedger()Per design of FabCar chaincode, the initLedger() is used to write 10 car records into the ledger.docker exec cli peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.example.com:7050 -C mychannel -n fabcar -c '{\"function\":\"initLedger\",\"Args\":[]}'The current height is now 3, which means Block #2 is created.Blockchain height is 3Again we obtain the Block #2 as before. Let\u2019s take a look on the transaction proposal and proposal response.Transaction ProposalInside the proposal, the chaincode we are invoking this time is fabcar. There is one argument, and the decoded result is initLedger, the function being invoked.Proposal ResponseRight: Only CAR0 and CAR9 are shown. CAR1 to CAR8 are collapsed.On the left portion of the diagram we see the same endorse and its signature in endorsements. The chaincode initLedger() writes 10 car records on the ledger and return nothing. Therefore the response is 200 with not further information. And in the result we see two RWSet items. The first item is of our interest as it involves the fabcar chaincode.We zoom the RWSet on the first item on the right portion of the diagram. The RWSet says \u201cread nothing, and write 10 car records in the ledger, from CAR0 to CAR9\u201d. If we decode the value of CAR0, we will get back {\u201cmake\u201d:\u201dToyota\u201d,\u201dmodel\u201d:\u201dPrius\u201d,\u201dcolour\u201d:\u201dblue\u201d,\u201downer\u201d:\u201dTomoko\u201d}. This is exactly what is coded in Fabcar chaincode.World StateOnce peer node gets this block and validates everything is good, it will commit the block to blockchain, and execute the RWSet onto the peer\u2019s world state.This is what we see from the CouchDB, the world state of peer0.org1.example.com. We see the 10 records indexed from CAR0 to CAR9, as coded in initLedger().Invoke changeCarOwner()The changeCarOwner() is used to change the owner of car. The argument required is the Car ID and the new owner name.docker exec cli peer chaincode invoke -C mychannel -n fabcar -c '{\"Args\":[\"changeCarOwner\", \"CAR0\", \"KC\"]}'The current height is now 4, which means Block #3 is created.Blockchain height is 4Transaction ProposalAgain the transaction proposal is upon chaincode fabcar. The three arguments this time are [\u201cchangeCarOwner\u201d, \u201cCAR0\u201d, \u201cKC\u201d].Proposal ResponseHere we just focus on the results (RWSet) in fabcar. We see the endorsement first reads CAR0, and the version is on Block #2 Transaction #0. It is the transaction of previous block where the CAR0 is created. The endorsement writes CAR0 with new value. The decoded value is {\u201cmake\u201d:\u201dToyota\u201d,\u201dmodel\u201d:\u201dPrius\u201d,\u201dcolour\u201d:\u201dblue\u201d,\u201downer\u201d:\u201dKC\u201d}. This is again what changeCarOwner() is coded in the Fabcar chaincode.World StateAfter committing this block and update the world state, the current world state of peer node looks like this. Note the change of owner of CAR0.Invoke queryCar()Finally we will invoke queryCar() and see the result.docker exec cli peer chaincode invoke -C mychannel -n fabcar -c '{\"Args\":[\"queryCar\", \"CAR0\"]}'This time a response is returned with the CAR0 record in the ledger.Similarly we obtain the Block #4 and take a look on the proposal response.Proposal ResponseThis time we see a response payload. The decoded message is {\u201ccolour\u201d:\u201dblue\u201d,\u201dmake\u201d:\u201dToyota\u201d,\u201dmodel\u201d:\u201dPrius\u201d,\u201downer\u201d:\u201dKC\u201d}, which is exactly the result we see after the queryCar() is invoked.In the RWSet endorser only reads the CAR0, and writes nothing. This is the logic coded in queryCar() in chaincode.Who Has Done What in a BlockWe on and off see the various actors (Client, Peer and Orderer) in the fabric network in handling transactions and building blocks. Here we use a block as example to give a whole picture.We take Block #3 as example.Client (CLI, with user Admin)Client creates the transaction (including the transaction proposal, endorsements and proposal response), signs it, and submits to orderer.When we decode the creator.id_bytes, we get back the certificate of Admin@org1.example.com, which is configured in CLI when invoking the chaincode.Endorsing PeerWithin the proposal response, we see the endorser and its signature on the response.The decoded endorser is the information Org1MSP and the certificate of peer0.org1.example.com.OrdererFinally orderer creates this block and the creator and signature is found in Metadata.The decoded result is the information of OrdererMSP and the certificate of orderer.example.com.SummaryThrough this demonstration we go a bit further understanding about transaction in Hyperledger Fabric. Each transaction recorded in the ledger (blockchain) holds the whole lifecycle of invoking chaincode: client creates and sends proposal to endorsers, endorsers create and sign response, orderer includes the proposal and response into a block, and all peer nodes commit the block and execute the RWSet on its world state.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Blockchain", "Hyperledger Fabric", "Transactions", "Enterprise Blockchain", "Chaincode"]}, {"title": "An Implementation of API Server for Hyperledger Fabric Network", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@kctheservant/an-implementation-of-api-server-for-hyperledger-fabric-network-8764c79f1a87?source=search_post", "author_name": "KC Tam", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@kctheservant", "publish_date": "2019-09-04", "last_modified_date": "2019-09-04", "readtime": "6.44", "claps": 67, "voters": 12, "content": "An Implementation of API Server for Hyperledger Fabric NetworkKC TamFollowSep 4 \u00b7 7 min readOverviewHyperledger Fabric comes with the Software Development Kit (SDK) for external access to a fabric network and chaincode functions deployed in the fabric network. Nowadays a more popular way of accessing an application is through REST API, which is not yet available officially in Hyperledger Fabric. Nevertheless it is not very difficult to implement one with some libraries.This article is to show how to use ExpressJS to implement one. For those following me, you may notice that this has been shown in my previous article \u201cDeep-Dive into Fabcar\u201d (link). In this article, I run the API server in a separate instance. I see this as more realistic implementation.Again I am using Fabcar as the application (chaincode) and First Network as the fabric network. The API server code is largely adopted from the original javascript code, with modification to meet the deployment.SetupIn this setup we have two physical nodesFabric Node: which runs the First Network with Fabcar chaincode instantiatedAPI Server Node: which runs the API Server code and for external accessHere are the two nodes deployed as EC2 instances in AWS.Setup the Fabric NodeStep 1: Make a fabric node by installing the prerequisite tools and all software related to Hyperledger Fabric. I am using release 1.4.3 in this demonstration. You can make reference to my previous article about building a fabric node.Setup a Hyperledger Fabric Host and Create a Machine ImageUse machine image (e.g. AMI) to speed up the preparation of a Hyperledger Fabric host for testing and practicingmedium.comStep 2: Run script fabcar/startFabric.sh.cd fabric-samples/fabcar./startFabric.shAfter this script is fully executed, we now have a running First Network (2-org 4-peer setup), mychannel is up, Fabcar chaincode is installed on all four peer nodes, and instantiated on mychannel. The ledger has 10 car records, which is a result of initLedger() being invoked. Everything on the fabric network side is up and running.To understand more about the First Network and Fabcar application, please take a look on my previous article, which has a more detail description.Deep-Dive into Fabcar (revised)A Complete Application Example on Hyperledger Fabricmedium.comNow let\u2019s prepare an identity for API Server.Step 3: Use client codes provided in fabcar/javascript to create a user (user1) identity. This will be used in API Server.cd javascriptnpm installnode enrollAdmin.jsnode registerUser.jsls wallet/user1Now we have all we need for API Server. They areConnection profile for org1: first-network/connection-org1.jsonNode Package file: fabcar/package.jsonUser1 identity or wallet: fabcar/javascript/wallet/user1/These files will be copied to API Server later.API Server: DesignWe are using ExpressJS to build the API Server, and leveraging the client code query.js and invoke.js to build the actual logic. Here we discuss a bit the code and configuration setup.API designWe are going to define four APIs. They areGET /api/queryallcars return all carsGET /api/query/CarID return the car record of CarID specifiedPOST /api/addcar/ add a new car record with detail specified in bodyPUT /api/changeowner/CarID change the car record with a new owner specified in bodyapiserver.jsThis is a standard ExpressJS code for an API Server. There are some modification from the provided query.js and invoke.js inside fabcar/javascript.ccpPath is changed to the current directory as we are going to keep connection-org1.json in the same path.in the gateway.connect of all APIs we change the option of discovery.asLocalhost to falseConnection Profile: connection-org1.jsonThe API Server relies on the connection profile given in order to make correct connection to fabric network. The file connection-org1.json is directly obtained from the fabric network, i.e., first-network.As we can cross-check the certificates are properly propagated when fabcar/startFabric.sh is executed. Those for peer0.org1 and peer1.org1 are taken from the TLS root CA cert of org1, while the one for CA is the CA certificate of org1.Note that all nodes are referred to localhost. We need to change it to the Fabric Node public IP later.User IdentityWe have generated a user (user1) on Fabric Node. They are stored inside wallet directory. Inside which we see three files. They are the private key (signing key), public key and an object keeping the required information such as certificate.We will copy this identity to API server later.Setup the API Server NodeStep 1: Install npm, node and make on the API Server Node.sudo apt-get updatesudo apt install curlcurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo bash -sudo apt install -y nodejssudo apt-get install build-essentialnode -vnpm -vStep 2: Create a directory in API server.mkdir apiservercd apiserverStep 3: Copy the following files from Fabric Node to the API server. We use a localhost to copy between the two EC2 instances.# localhost (update your own IP of the two servers)# temp is an empty directorycd tempscp -i ~/Downloads/aws.pem ubuntu@[Fabric-Node-IP]:/home/ubuntu/fabric-samples/first-network/connection-org1.json .scp -i ~/Downloads/aws.pem ubuntu@[Fabric-Node-IP]:/home/ubuntu/fabric-samples/fabcar/javascript/package.json .scp -r -i ~/Downloads/aws.pem ubuntu@[Fabric-Node-IP]:/home/ubuntu/fabric-samples/fabcar/javascript/wallet/user1/ .scp -r -i ~/Downloads/aws.pem * ubuntu@[API-Server-Node-IP]:/home/ubuntu/apiserver/Step 4: We see all these files now in API Server. For sake of consistence we move user1/ to wallet/user1/.cd apiservermkdir walletmv user1 wallet/user1Step 5: Now create the apiserver.js file for the API server.Step 6: Modify the connection profile connection-org1.json with the Fabric Node IP address.sed -i 's/localhost/[Fabric-Node-IP]/g' connection-org1.jsonStep 7: Add entries in /etc/hosts such that they will point to Fabric Node.127.0.0.1 localhost[Fabric-Node-IP] orderer.example.com[Fabric-Node-IP] peer0.org1.example.com[Fabric-Node-IP] peer1.org1.example.com[Fabric-Node-IP] peer0.org2.example.com[Fabric-Node-IP] peer1.org2.example.comStep 8: Install the required modules.npm installnpm install express body-parser --saveStep 9: Now we have all the required modules. We can run API server.node apiserver.jsAccess the APIOur API server listens to port 8080. We set up the API Server Node such that these APIs are accessible everywhere. In this demo I am using my localhost to access the APIs with curl.Test 1: Query all carscurl http://[API-Server-Node-IP]:8080/api/queryallcarsHere we see the 10 preloaded car records in the ledgerTest 2: Add a new car and query that carcurl -d '{\"carid\":\"CAR12\",\"make\":\"Honda\",\"model\":\"Accord\",\"colour\":\"black\",\"owner\":\"Tom\"}' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST http://[API-Server-Node-IP]:8080/api/addcarcurl http://[API-Server-Node-IP]:8080/api/query/CAR12We see the newly added car record in ledger.Test 3: Change owner for a car and query that car againcurl http://[API-Server-Node-IP]:8080/api/query/CAR4curl -d '{\"owner\":\"KC\"}' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X PUT http://[API-Server-Node-IP]:8080/api/changeowner/CAR4curl http://[API-Server-Node-IP]:8080/api/query/CAR4We see the owner of a specified car updated in the ledger.And we get the same result using Postman.DiscussionThough we are using one Fabric Node to simulate a whole fabric network, this setup should be applicable to more complex deployment (e.g. multi-node, multi-channel). What we need is to provide the correct connection profile for API server to access.Note that the digital identity (certificate) is kept in API Server. This means that all transactions, no matter issued from anyone outside the world, are \u201cproxied\u201d by the API Server. If we need access control on the API Server, it is something beyond the Hyperledger Fabric. We can use traditional methods to control the access to API Server.If we wish to identify the incoming user in the fabric network level, we need to pass the user identity to end user, and develop a mechanism to let user sign the transaction. It is out of the scope of this article.This approach should be easily adapted into docker container, as far as all required components and configuration are done when creating an image. It can be further optimized with proper variable setup to avoid manual modification.SummaryWe have used a separate EC2 instance holding the API Server, accessing a fabric network with chaincode deployed. This serves a standard way to allow other applications or frontend accessing those chaincode functions according to the logic defined in the API server.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Hyperledger Fabric", "Blockchain Application", "Rest Api", "Nodejs"]}, {"title": "Words and swords: an essay about Hyper Light Drifter", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@pattheflip/words-and-swords-an-essay-about-hyper-light-drifter-74dec8120f3d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Patrick Miller", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@pattheflip", "publish_date": "2016-04-03", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-21", "readtime": "7.62", "claps": 8, "voters": 8, "content": "Words and swords: an essay about Hyper Light DrifterPatrick MillerFollowApr 3, 2016 \u00b7 8 min readby Patrick Miller \u2014 follow me on Twitter, Twitch, YouTube, or subscribe to my newsletter! Also, you might like my short stories Re: Member and MVP \u2014 a game dev short story.I played through Hyper Light Drifter over the last two days and figured I\u2019d put down some thoughts about it. Fair warning: I know some of the folks who worked on this game! I won\u2019t be dispensing any buying advice besides \u201cWatch the trailer and see if you like it,\u201d and I don\u2019t spoil any particular plot elements or story stuff.First, let\u2019s talk about me a lotOver the last few years, I\u2019ve gradually been coming to learn a lot more about how I consume and engage with different kinds of media and stories, and how the things I like and the reasons I like them tend to be a bit more specific than I originally thought. Chief among these realizations is this: I like words, and I need lots of them.Those of you who know me might immediately reply with: \u201cOf course you do, dipshit \u2014 you\u2019ve been working as a writer and an editor for years now.\u201d Well, truth be told, it took me a while to stop taking my skills in that area for granted. I always thought of that as a thing that I could do maybe a little bit better than your average college graduate, and I didn\u2019t consider it anything particularly special.On the other hand, I\u2019d be awed by anyone with the slightest capacity for visual design or illustration; things like our magazine art producer having opinions on where an image should go and why baffled the heck out of me, because to me, it didn\u2019t really make a difference. (If you\u2019ve ever stopped reading a Game Developer Magazine article because you ran into a 900-word wall of text, you can blame me for that one.)My brain craves words. It\u2019s why I devour Reddit and Twitter but can\u2019t be bothered with YouTube; it\u2019s why I read all the words on a page of a comic book before looking at the pictures; it\u2019s why I write. Ironically, I\u2019m not particularly well-read when it comes to books of any kind, and I suspect it might be because I\u2019m too hooked on the constant feed of words from the Internet to sit down and actually finish reading something. (I also love movies and rarely watch them on my own.)It\u2019s also why I adore Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and simply can\u2019t get excited for Super Metroid. Goodness knows I\u2019ve tried, multiple times, to save the damn animals or whatever, but I just get bored. You can show me all the lovely level design and invisible tutorial stuff you like, but if you don\u2019t give me someone to give a shit about, I\u2019m not going to play your game. Symphony of the Night, for all of its angsty teen goth stuff, gave me Alucard, Richter, and Maria. Super Metroid didn\u2019t give me shit. Also: Another World is beautiful and splendid (and definitely not for me).The exceptions to this rule are games where the play itself is so compelling and full of mastery that I stick around. Flappy Bird, ZiGGURAT, Super Hexagon, and Canabalt are great examples of this because they demand nothing of me other than the desire to Git Gud; competitive games use other people as the characters and give me a rich playspace upon which I may decorate them with my pain-brush.The part where I start talking about Hyper Light DrifterNow: on to Hyper Light Drifter. If I were to describe it in one sentence, it\u2019d be this: \u201cHyper Light Drifter is a beautiful \u201990s Frankenstein,\u201d and if you felt like being pedantic, I\u2019d grumpily add the \u201c-\u2019s Monster\u201d part at the end.There are so many notes and moments in the game that feel like the team combed through every JRPG made in the \u201990s and borrowed the things they like best \u2014 things that I had never even thought about until I saw them in HLD and thought, \u201cHey, I liked it when Chrono Trigger included beautiful views in their level design,\u201d or, \u201cThis thing was clearly made by someone who tried to get really, really good at navigating with Teleport running in Earthbound.\u201dAnd where \u201990s RPGs began to inject a little bit of bleak despair into their stories (see: FFVI\u2019s World of Ruin, Chrono Trigger\u2019s future, pretty much everything in Illusion of Gaia), HLD starts in the despair from the first moment and never really lets up. In that respect, it feels like a post-\u201990s RPG, made by adults raised on \u201990s RPGs for other adults raised on \u201990s RPGs; imagine the assault on Kefka\u2019s Tower not as striking the first blow to bring the world back to \u201cnormal,\u201d but as the last chance for our heroes to have an honorable death.Perhaps the thing that HLD nails most strongly in its homage to \u201990s RPGs is the weird sense of loneliness that comes in exploring a world that was made without you, the player. You don\u2019t find this as much in a Final Fantasy or a Chrono Trigger because they gave you characters that fit into the world so you could just fit yourself along with them, but games with a) silent protagonists and b) action combat often felt like you were mutely walking through a mysterious and vibrant world that was trying to kill you. It\u2019s the feeling of renting Link to the Past or Super Metroid and picking up from a previous player\u2019s save when you\u2019ve never played the game before.That\u2019s because the game is almost completely wordless.This is what made me resent HLD as I played it. Each area has secrets hidden according to logic that makes perfect sense if you\u2019ve played the canon that inspired HLD; each fight felt punishing-but-fair; each combat mechanic felt like a good-enough balance between offering easily accessible power and rewarding those who chose to master. The problem was that I could feel the game begging me to care. Countless times I saw a secret lying just out of my reach, or a battle mechanic that could grant me immense power if mastered, or a cryptic allusion to the story hidden behind an arrangement of skeletons or an NPC\u2019s story-comic, and in each of these elements it felt like the game was begging me to fill the gaps in with my imagination.And each time I answered \u201cNo, and fuck you for asking.\u201dI didn\u2019t get all the stuff in HLD. I don\u2019t think I even got half the stuff in HLD. I guess there\u2019s a costume mechanic, but I didn\u2019t find out about that until I was almost done. I lost count of all the stuff I was supposed to be collecting \u2014 fragments and keys and something about tablets. There\u2019s a boss that I definitely didn\u2019t fight. Maybe there are multiple endings? I liked the dashing mini-game enough to break 100, and I saw on the subreddit that there\u2019s a soccer minigame that I never found. You want me to try and remember all these things I should come back to later? Good luck with that.Nor did I become a particularly dextrous Drifter; the battle and movement just always felt slightly off. A few more cancelable frames here and there to make weaving from combat and movement feel better, some invincible frames and better communication around hitboxes and reactions, some more love given to intertwining resource systems, perhaps. The combat system is hard, but I didn\u2019t see beauty in it; perhaps a speedrunner or a perfect play will show me something I overlooked.This is not new behavior for me; I\u2019m not a completionist in any game these days. But I don\u2019t remember ever feeling like a game was thirsty in its desire to persuade me that there is something rich and deep lying beneath the surface if I would just be willing to let myself sink into it and inhale. Contrast this with Undertale, which tries to persuade me to come back with living, breathing characters that reflect the changes I make to their world, or with the Souls games, which are unapologetic and honest in how inextricable the world is to its difficulty; they are both sincere and honest in what they are and why they\u2019re that way.HLD, in comparison, feels like it is trying to convince you it\u2019s more than what it seems at first; maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t, but the fact that I can tell it\u2019s trying just turns me off. If anything, the fact that it\u2019s so damn pretty is kind of infuriating, because it makes me want more but gives me nothing I want. \u201cLook at how cool I am,\u201d it seems to say to me, \u201cDon\u2019t you wish you knew more about me?\u201d And then I say in response: \u201cWell, I did until you said that.\u201d Maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s silent.Talking about me againI don\u2019t want people to misread my opinion as \u201cHyper Light Drifter is a bad game and you shouldn\u2019t buy it\u201d; I think if you\u2019re interested, you should watch the trailer and give it a shot. It is gorgeous and well-crafted, and considering I only finish maybe three games a year on my own, I think that\u2019s worthy of recognizing. It tries to remake the sense of wonder many of us found in classic JRPGs, and for me it failed but was interesting in its failure because I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s the wrong game or I\u2019m the wrong person \u2014 too old, or too wordy, or something.(The funny thing about using the line \u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u201d in a breakup is because it can be completely true in that instance, but if you hear it fairly often while being dumped, it\u2019s probably, in fact, you.)I went through the whole game looking for a reason to care about the Drifter, or the world, or anything enough to keep going. I could tell that the combat and movement mechanics went deeper than most, but I didn\u2019t find enough satisfaction in being good at it to find the motivation to get better. I could tell that there were characters and some kind of story going on, but without words, I couldn\u2019t be bothered to remember what the deal was with the frogs or the birds or the dog thing. Ironically, the game that I wanted to play most was the one shown in the flashback cutscenes or whatever they were, not the actual game.And so I got the four things that made the thing power up, I went into the thing and beat the final boss, saw the ending, groaned when I saw there was a New Game+ mode, and went to go watch something on Netflix. Brooding and moody is great for a one night stand, man, but if you\u2019re going for a relationship you better be ready to talk about your feelings.I don\u2019t know if most will react this way. I\u2019m sure there are people out there for whom words and plot is a burden, and the world of HLD speaks directly to their soul, or people who see the difficulty in the combat system and are compelled to master it Because It\u2019s There. In the end, I still can\u2019t figure out if there\u2019s more lying underneath that I didn\u2019t see, or if I mistook the trappings of depth for depth itself. I guess I wrote this mostly to figure out if anyone else felt the same.It\u2019s not you, Drifter, it\u2019s me.\u2014 patrick miller", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Video Games", "Hyper Light Drifter", "Indie Games"]}]
