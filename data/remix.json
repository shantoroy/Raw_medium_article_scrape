Building these moats is a difficult challenge for today\u2019s leaders due to dramatic platform innovations.Earlier this year I explained why systems of intelligence\u2122 \u2014 AI powered applications \u2014 are the next defensible business model. I recently presented this topic and shared the slides below. The deck builds on how different types of traditional economic moats are being disrupted and why intelligent applications will be the foundation for the next generation of great software companies.We have undergone one of the largest platform shifts in a generation as applications move to the cloud, are built on open source and are fueled by AI and data. This dramatic shift makes some existing moats useless.Economies of Scale: The bigger you are the more operating leverage you have which lowers your costs.Network Effects: Best described by Metcalf\u2019s law, your product or service has \u201cnetwork effects\u201d if each additional user of your product accrues more value to every other user.Deep tech / IP / trade secrets: Proprietary software or methods is where most technology companies start. These trade secrets can include novel solutions to hard technical problems, new inventions, new processes, new techniques, and later, patents that protects the developed intellectual property (IP).High Switching Costs: Once a customer is using your product, you want it to become as difficult as possible for them to switch to a competitor. You can build this stickiness through standardization, from a lack of substitutes, through integrations to other apps and data sources, or because you have built an entrenched and valuable workflow that your customers depend on.Brand and Customer Loyalty: With each positive interaction between your product and your customers, your brand advantage gets stronger over time, but brand strength can quickly evaporate if your customers lose trust in your product.I appreciate any of your feedback as my thinking around this discussion becomes more refined.

Streets enable these connections: your city\u2019s community members need good streets to access jobs, move safely and sustainably, and live well.Here at Remix, we\u2019re excited to pilot a new product to design city streets.We\u2019re designing it on top of the new data standard called SharedStreets, which is being developed by the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) and the Open Transport Partnership. We need your input to help us build the right thing! \ud83c\udf89In his seminal book The Image of the City (1960), American urban planner Kevin Lynch placed streets and paths at the start of our understanding of cities in a list of five elements: streets, edges, districts, nodes, and landmarks.Why we\u2019re doing itFor planners, transportation engineers, and urban designers, streets are the raw networks that help residents move. To support a complete set of transportation modes and eliminate pedestrian fatalities, pedestrian, bicycle, vehicle, and freight movement data is crucial. But there\u2019s no shared platform to capture data findings, analyze them, and collaborate on solutions. Why is that the case?Turns out, there are three main challenges standing in the way\u2026which we actually prefer to think of as opportunities.Opportunity 1: The Complete Picture Is Hard To FindToday, there\u2019s more data than ever describing movement, collisions, curb pickup locations \u2014 but it\u2019s often just out of reach for planners. Maybe it\u2019s only available from commercial providers in a format more accessible to academics than planners. Private companies may be reluctant to share their data at all because it\u2019s proprietary or incompatible.We\u2019ve talked to numerous urban planners about their data challenges. In King County, Washington, transit planner Daniel Rowe shared that he regularly struggles with the problem of matching city streets between datasets.\u201cThere\u2019s no GTFS for street data currently\u201d said Rowe, referring to the successful General Transit Feed Specification pioneered by Portland TriMet\u2019s Bibiana McHugh with Google Maps 13 years ago.With reliable access to emerging sources of urban data, many say they\u2019d do better work. What if different sources could connect to an underlying network, putting activities on streets in useful context? What if you could visually see, share, and update complete data about the segments in your city\u2019s entire street network?Using SharedStreets for linear referencing of segments to bring together a more complete picture of existing conditions.Opportunity 2: Cities Lack A Reliable Streets DatabaseCities are often hampered by a fragmented, piecemeal approach to understanding current infrastructure. Some general observations:Facts about as-built conditions may be scattered across files, databases, email threads \u2014 thus hard to find, collate, and visualize for audiences.Data that does exist is often not portable between applications, locked into specific vendors, simulations, or use cases, when the data could be useful for more than one purpose.Re-surveying streets and asking neighboring departments for planning updates are common causes of wasted time and energy.Shared data sources like OpenStreetMap, the wiki world map started by volunteer mappers in 2004, are promising but often don\u2019t precisely match official sources and omit data needed for applications like curb inventory.Meanwhile, popular special-purpose planning tools like our friends at Streetmix have inspired the field and opened up the possibility of high-quality urban design to new communities.We\u2019ve talked to planners about the common lack of a shared repository of street facts. Sarah Fine, a planner in Oakland CA, uses Streetmix when brainstorming new lane configuration concepts. It can be challenging and resource-intensive to build cross sections up to a fully laid-out corridor plan complete with curb-to-curb dimensions.What if you could connect all these sources into a new shared platform so that everyone can benefit from the same understanding of the built environment?Imagine if you could start \u201cediting\u201d a street right away \u2014 on top of a shared understanding of the built environmentOpportunity 3: Few Tools Represent Street NetworksStreets in a city are a network: residents rarely experience a single street segment in isolation. GIS tools typically record where streets and assets are located, but not how they\u2019re connected. Useful network data includes movement through intersections, parking space inventory and meter income along segments, and the impact of changes to neighboring streets.We are excited about NACTO\u2019s plans to repeat the success of GTFS with SharedStreets, especially the goal of \u201ca digital commons for streets\u201d acting as \u201ca launchpad for public-private collaboration and data exchange \u2026 through a non-proprietary system for describing streets.\u201dIt paints a compelling picture of a new platform for planning complete street networks \u2014 for the benefit of all users.When approaching streets with network data (such as movement counts), it opens up opportunities by taking advantage of all of the assets in an area as compared to a single corridor. Creative solutions around issues such as lane capacity, modal priority, and parking supply are easier to find when evaluating at the network level.Try Me \u270b\ud83c\udffcWe\u2019re looking for cities of all shapes and sizes to collaborate with as we build this new product.

Instead of trying to convince people of this (which is like pushing a boulder up a hill once they start running the script that they aren\u2019t \u201ccreative\u201d), I think it\u2019s better to tell aspiring writers what all succeeding writers already know:You don\u2019t have to be original.Everything is a remix.Remix, Don\u2019t PlagiarizeIn the world of content creation, there\u2019s plagiarism (which you obviously don\u2019t want to do) and then there\u2019s remixing.Plagiarism is when you take something else that is very clearly somebody else\u2019s work verbatim (or pretty close to verbatim) and pass it off as your own original work. If you wrote an article about this cool technique you developed to measure your fears and it is a word-for-word copy of Tim Ferriss\u2019s Fear Setting exercises, then you\u2019re plagiarizing Tim Ferriss. If you instead take Fear Setting and apply it to an area of life unique to you and your experiences, while giving credit that the original process came from TF, you\u2019re not plagiarizing.Most people don\u2019t really plagiarize and, when they do, it\u2019s not malicious. Don\u2019t worry about that.Instead, think about remixing.The great stories throughout history are all remixes of the same plots. Pinocchio, Peter Pan, the story of Christ, the parable of Philoctetes, Jonah and the whale, and numerous other famous stories follow the plot of descending into darkness to save something whole. The Disney princess stories come from thousands of years of European and Asian princess stories. Famous musical performances from Haydn through Wiz follow the same chord progressions. Even in the personal development world, lines of thought that have very little to do with each other are remixes on the same themes of personal responsibility and frame control.The things worth saying and worth reading are worth being said by different people at different times.One of the most common remixes. source: wikipediaRemixing is as easy as consuming and creating.How to RemixMy number one piece of advice for aspiring writers is to read more and write more.There\u2019s a reason that it\u2019s both of those.Reading more lets you take in more raw information, sure. If you want to write about cooking and you read about more cooking techniques, you\u2019ll learn more stuff you can write about.But it\u2019s also to help you notice major themes and archetypes through writing throughout history (also why I recommend reading older books when possible). Once you read dozens of books on the same handful of topics, you see that there are really only two or three core things you need to know.Everything else is a remix.To overcome your fear of needing to be \u201coriginal\u201d and start remixing, follow these steps:Start writing. Choose something that interests you and write some simple posts about it. These posts can just be about your own personal experience with these things, or they can be book reviews, or even poems. Just start writing. In my case, I am interested in education, so I wrote about education while working at an education company.Start reading. Read more on this topic. Find the top couple of books that people read on it and consume those. Keep writing while you\u2019re reading. In my case, I started reading more about education.Read in another area that interests you. Find another area that is supposedly unrelated and start reading in that area. I am also interested in economics and psychology, so I read some classics in both and some pop books in both.Combine the two areas in a post. Write about \u201cThe X of Y,\u201d (e.g., \u201cthe history of cooking,\u201d or \u201cthe psychology of higher education,\u201d or \u201ccooking and American cars,\u201d) or make notes while reading about things authors in different fields are saying that sound similar.Share your articles with others. When getting started, Wordpress and Medium are good tools for writing. As you gain more momentum, try to get your posts shared by other writers and do guest posts on others\u2019 blogs. I put together my tried-and-true email scripts for boosting your writing to bigger audiences available here.Repeat. As you share your articles, others may send new resources your way. Keep reading. Keep writing. Combine.If you do this repeatedly enough, you end up developing your own semi-original niche. In my case, I\u2019ve carved out an interesting place I enjoy writing between the intersections of education, personal development, and professional development. These are the things I enjoy reading about and that people pay me to talk about, so the niche serves my life in other ways, too. For you, your primary niche should be something you enjoy reading books (or articles) about as it is. Don\u2019t try to force yourself to enjoy something you don\u2019t because it\u2019s trendy or because you think it will get more clicks.Go forth and remix.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Writing", "Writing Tips", "Creativity", "Productivity", "Life"]}, {"title": "HOMEM, VOC\u00ca QUER TRATAR MELHOR AS MULHERES?

The once-novel concept of taking two disparate artists or albums and mixing them together has been beaten to death to a point that even when done well, it is now often approached with a high degree of skepticism.Modern listeners may feel jaded towards new mashup releases, but not too long ago the mashup was a still a fresh concept. The origins of mashups span back to the early days of hip-hop DJing, taking form in bootleg party records, mixtape blends and megamixes by folks like Double Dee and Steinski. You can hear the foundation of mashups in Dr. Dre\u2019s 86 In The Mix, Ron G\u2019s Michael Jackson blends, DJ Spinbad Rocks The Casbah: 80s Megamix Vol. One and countless mixtapes where DJs blended disparate genres with rap. When Z-Trip and DJ P made their Uneasy Listening Vol. 1 mixtape in 2001\u2014pairing classic pop and rock songs with rap acapellas and instrumentals\u2014it brought a newfound awareness to genre-bending remix projects. The self-produced, underground mix CD made the year-end favorite lists of Entertainment Weekly, Los Angeles Times, New York Times, Rolling Stone, Spin, and URB.These ambitious creative efforts set the stage for Brian \u201cDanger Mouse\u201d Burton to release The Grey Album in 2004\u2014a high-concept mashup of Jay-Z\u2019s vocals from The Black Album and beats made from samples of music from The Beatles\u2019 \u201cWhite Album.\u201d It would have a cascading effect on the music industry, not only blurring the lines between genres, but also writing the blueprint for every future do-it-yourself Internet remixer to follow.To understand how Burton, better known as Danger Mouse, went from releasing The Grey Album to producing albums for Beck, Broken Bells, The Black Keys, and U2, it is important to look at the early years of his career. Before composing The Grey Album, DJ Danger Mouse was making CDR mixtapes with the British cartoon character of the same name featured on the artwork. These early mixtapes included mashups using Nas vocals and Portishead beats\u2014not as refined as his current work, but an indication that a project like The Grey Album was not far away.Take a closer look and you will also see he was remixing a certain Liverpool band on his Promo Vol. 2 tape in 1999. \u201cThat was the first time I ever mixed The Beatles,\u201d Danger Mouse later explained in a short video interview.While his initial attraction to reworking The Beatles had been formed, the creation of The Grey Album was still a few years away. Early on, his choice remixes were pressed on vinyl and sold at various \u2018mom and pop\u2019 record shops alongside his mixtapes. In 2003, he transitioned from mixtape DJ to official album producer with the release of Ghetto Pop Life, his collaborative effort with rapper Gemini The Gifted One. Although Danger Mouse produced beats for his own mixtapes, his production for Gemini was his earliest official album work. \u201cThe first three beats I did, I stuck \u2019em on a CD, and Gem rhymed on all of them,\u201d he said in an interview with Lawrence Billups. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones that got me the deal at the record label (Lex Records).\u201dDanger Mouse & Gemini The Gifted One in 2003But with the Internet still relatively new in 2003, independent artists had far fewer options for making direct connections with fans and catching the eye of the press. DM & Gemini \u2014 as they were called at the time \u2014 were fortunate to have writer Adrienne Acosta in their corner, who later would help in various aspects of promotion at Danger Mouse\u2019s label, Lex Records. Acosta\u2019s recollection of their initial meeting made it sound like a doomed partnership. Danger Mouse, who had never spoken to Acosta before, said, \u201cBefore I sit down and have a conversation with you, I need you to tell me your top five favorite albums. I really can\u2019t communicate with people that I\u2019m not on the same level with.\u201d As luck would have it, they shared a common three: Portishead\u2019s self-titled sophomore LP, Isaac Hayes\u2019 Hot Buttered Soul, and Sparklehorse\u2019s It\u2019s A Wonderful Life.Although their partnership may have seemed inauspicious at first, Acosta\u2019s efforts in promoting Ghetto Pop Life paid off. The fledgling indie hip-hop album received strong reviews from the likes of The Independent, Pitchfork, and XLR8R. \u201cAlong with Outkast\u2019s double-header, Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, Ghetto Pop Life is this year\u2019s most engrossing hip-hop record,\u201d wrote The Independent.In addition to the much-welcomed critical acclaim, it was during the recording process for Ghetto Pop Life that Danger Mouse would hone his meticulous ear and obsessive willingness to scour records for usable bits and pieces. When breaking down the process of constructing \u201cThe Only One,\u201d which ended up becoming the album\u2019s most recognizable track, Danger Mouse explained that he used three different samples to construct the record\u2019s signature guitar sounds while trying out 30 different records to find the perfect vocal sample for the intro and hook. It was this level of dedication to finding the perfect fit that would inform his production process for The Grey Album.Two months after the release of Danger Mouse and Gemini\u2019s debut, Jay Z dropped The Black Album, which he had dubbed as his final LP, creating a fervor around the project. Always a marketing genius, Jay figured out another way to increase the hype surrounding his \u201cretirement\u201d effort by taking note of what his peers were doing. In previous years, Nas had experimented with putting out the full album acapellas \u2014 the isolated vocals only, with no beats or music behind them \u2014 for his albums Stillmatic and God\u2019s Son. This gave aspiring producers a chance to remix his work and, by extension, further spread his lyrics to new fans.Jay followed suit and released a full-length acapella version of The Black Album to radio DJs on a promotional-only basis. Producers clamored to get a copy so that they could have a chance to rework Jay\u2019s vocals, with folks like 9th Wonder and Kev Brown doing remixes of the entire album. \u201cDanger Mouse called us and was like, \u2018Please save me two copies of the Black Album acapella vinyl,\u2019\u201d says Cuepoint\u2019s Mike Pizzo, who ran online record retailer HipHopSite.Com at the time.Once his copies arrived, Danger Mouse wasted no time in sharing his idea for The Grey Album with Acosta, who continued to be a trusted confidante after playing a critical role in helping Ghetto Pop Life find its audience.\u201cThat morning when I went to work, he was like, \u2018Sit down, we need to talk, I have this brilliant idea!\u2019\u201d Acosta recalls. \u201cI\u2019d never seen him get that excited.\u201dAccording to Acosta, the moment that The Black Album acapellas arrived, he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to be in my room, don\u2019t expect to see me.\u201d Burton affirmed this apparent level of hyper-focus in MTV interview after The Grey Album\u2019s release. \u201cI was obsessed with the whole project, that\u2019s all I was trying to do,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce I got into it, I didn\u2019t think about anything but finishing it.\u201dThe obsessive, repetitive listening that Danger Mouse utilized when composing Ghetto Pop Life would serve him well in his endless replaying of The White Album. MTV\u2019s Corey Moss reported, \u201che scoured all 30 songs on The White Album, listening for every strike of a drum or cymbal when other instruments or voices were not in the mix.\u201d He then used all of the isolated sounds he collected to produce original instrumentals to pair with Jay Z\u2019s vocals. Danger Mouse\u2019s tireless dedication to only using one album for his sample sources is impressive. Even the drums were composed of \u201cevery possible Ringo Starr part from The White Album.\u201d While the art of sampling was already a few decades old in 2004, only using one album for your sample sources to compose an entirely new album was generally unheard of.A project this intense may have taken some months to complete, true to his earlier conversation with Acosta, but Danger Mouse completed The Grey Album in just a few days after working nonstop. \u201cHe came out of his room and he looked horrible,\u201d laughs Acosta. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Check it out and tell me what you think.\u2019\u201d Acosta, Burton, and his roommate sat down to listen to the album and in an instant they knew they had something special on their hands.A photo of an original copy of \u2018The Grey Album\u2019 on CD, proudly ripped and uploaded to the internet by \u201cGCP.\u201dPizzo\u2019s camp, who hadn\u2019t spoken to Danger Mouse since they sent the Black Album acapellas, was contacted as soon as The Grey Album was completed. The album went on sale on CD a short time later. \u201cThe night that we actually posted it on HipHopSite.com for sale, it sold out immediately,\u201d says Pizzo. \u201cThe next day we got the cease and desist letter. We were like, \u2018well, there\u2019s no more anyway, soooo...\u2019 Once MTV reported that EMI had sent a cease and desist letter out, it made the project so much bigger.\u201dThe cease and desist letter didn\u2019t come as a complete surprise to Danger Mouse. \u201cI never once thought for a second it would get cleared,\u201d he said in an interview with UCLA\u2019s Hammer Museum. At the same time, he didn\u2019t realize it would end up having the reach that it did. \u201cAll I thought when I did it was that it would be a cult underground thing that maybe some people would talk about later on,\u201d he said. Furthermore, he was more concerned with making a quality project than worrying about copyright law. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it because of copyright laws,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wanted to see what would happen.\u201dAlthough Danger Mouse has said that he was more focused on the music than the legal aspects of the album, while talking to MTV a short time after The Grey Album\u2019s release in 2004, he seemed to have a sense the project would open many people\u2019s eyes to the power of a mashup or remix album. \u201cIt is an art form. It is music,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be just what some people call \u2018stealing.\u2019 It can be a lot more than that.\u201dShortly after the cease and desist letters were sent, the website Downhill Battle organized a massive campaign of civil disobedience. Downhill Battle was an influential non-profit in the mid-to-late-2000s whose mission was to \u201csupport participatory culture and build a fairer music industry.\u201d Refusing to accept EMI\u2019s attempts to limit access to Danger Mouse\u2019s album, they worked in collaboration with 170 other websites to host the album for free download for one day. The involved sites also changed their banner design to a grey background as a display of solidarity. February 24th, 2004 would be known as Grey Tuesday. The online event was a massive success and the start of Danger Mouse\u2019s meteoric rise to fame.Grey Tuesday helped push the album\u2019s popularity to its limit, but Downhill Battle co-founder Holmes Wilson is quick to point out that The Grey Album was already a critical darling before his website got involved. \u201cIt had been written up in The New Yorker already, it was going to be on some peoples\u2019 best of the year lists for sure,\u201d he says. \u201cThis was part of why we did the protest. We were asking ourselves, \u2018How the hell could an album that\u2019s a critical hit and getting written up in The New Yorker, of all places, be getting sued out of existence, and chased off the internet?\u2019 It just seemed so backwards and sad that the musician who made this should be sitting there in fear of getting sued.\u201dWhile Wilson is correct in acknowledging that The Grey Album would have made an impact without Grey Tuesday, the increased reach after the protest is undeniable. In a 2004 interview with Z-Trip, Wilson and Downhill Battle co-founder Nicholas Reville revealed that the album was downloaded 100,000 times on Grey Tuesday, which was a huge feat in the early days of digital music. In another post, Wilson and Reville shared some fascinating results from their file sharing analysis. Users had downloaded Danger Mouse more on Grey Tuesday than Kanye West and Norah Jones. Danger Mouse had gone from a producer with some minor buzz to a household name with over one million of his tracks downloaded in one day. He had outperformed two of the most bankable names in music (for one day, at least).In addition to helping Danger Mouse reach levels of popularity that had seemed impossible without a major label or publicist behind him, The Grey Album and Grey Tuesday shined a very bright light on the murky sampling laws that prevent many independent musicians from making licensed remix and mashup albums. In an interview with MTV a short time after Grey Tuesday, Reville said, \u201cMusicians that build a collage are treated like criminals. We need to find a way to change that to make sampling practical.\u201d EMI was unmoved by this sentiment at the time and felt that Danger Mouse had avoided using the appropriate procedure for sampling their work. \u201cThere is a well-established market for licensing samples and remixes,\u201d an EMI spokesperson said. \u201cIn this case, the DJ did not ask us permission and never attempted to use established channels.\u201dIndeed there were established channels for clearing samples in 2004, yet legal sampling can be complicated, expensive, and often cost-prohibitive. For a little-known artist like Danger Mouse to go through the proper channels and clear every sample on The Grey Album would have required a budget well beyond his scope, a fact EMI would have been aware of. To give some context, AMC\u2019s Mad Men made headlines in 2012 for paying $250,000 to license a single Beatles song.There may have been other factors that made Danger Mouse cautious about going through official channels with his album. There is a long and well-documented history of rock musicians and their record labels not having a favorable view towards sample-based music. As Turtles founder Mark Volman once said after settling out-of-court after a sample dispute with De La Soul, \u201cSampling is just a longer term for theft. Anybody who can honestly say sampling is some sort of creativity has never done anything creative.\u201dThe fierce debate over The Grey Album\u2019s right to exist exposed another problem with sampling laws: labels sometimes ignored their artist\u2019s opinions towards having their work sampled. Subsequent interviews with Paul McCartney revealed that The Beatles camp had little interest in raising a stink over The Grey Album. When asked about his feelings towards the project, McCartney told BBC Radio 1, \u201cI didn\u2019t mind when something like that happened with The Grey Album. But the record company minded. They put up a fuss. But it was like, \u2018Take it easy guys, it\u2019s a tribute.\u2019\u201dJay Z echoed a similar sentiment while speaking to Terry Gross on NPR\u2019s Fresh Air. \u201cI think it was a really strong album,\u201d Jay said. \u201cI champion any form of creativity, and that was a genius idea.\u201d Roc-A-Fella backed up this sentiment and neglected to take any legal action action against Danger Mouse. While it is nice to see the appreciation both artists had for Danger Mouse\u2019s effort, if all artists being sampled approve of a mashup or other work of sample-based music, shouldn\u2019t the label consider their opinion before sending out a cease and desist?Jay-Z in 2003Grey Tuesday and the resulting media attention helped Danger Mouse\u2019s project reach the far corners of the internet, but he seemed to have mixed feelings about Downhill Battle\u2019s efforts when reflecting on their protest a few years later. \u201cI realized it was probably more about what they were doing than what I did,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just hoping that it had the right effect when it was done. I still didn\u2019t know how I felt about the whole thing. But I figured I wasn\u2019t going to say anything one way or another.\u201dWhen assessing the legal issues that surrounded The Grey Album, it is important to remember that there was an actual body of music behind all the juicy controversy. The album was very well-received by critics and fans for its innovative production and creative sample use. Pitchfork described the rework of \u201cDirt Off Your Shoulder\u201d\u2014which utilized an unexpected sample source in \u201cJulia\u201d\u2014as \u201cPrefuse 73 meeting David Banner\u201d. Respected hip-hop journalist Oliver Wang said, \u201che\u2019s doing Timbaland-type work to program these tracks to perfection.\u201d In particular, Wang was impressed by the utilization of \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d in the remix of \u201c99 Problems,\u201d as Danger Mouse flipped no less than four of the source material\u2019s elements to craft his instrumental. The praise of various magazines and news outlets wasn\u2019t mere passing fancy either. NME ranked The Grey Album as number 80 on it\u2019s The Top 100 Greatest Albums of The Decade in 2009.Beyond critical acclaim, Danger Mouse inspired a generation of producers to release what they could assemble with records, a turntable, a simple multi-track records program like Acid Pro, and their imaginations. Looking back on Danger Mouse\u2019s path to fame, Pizzo sees his journey as an embodiment of the hopes and dreams of many young producers today. \u201cTo do The Gorillaz album immediately after The Grey Album, that\u2019s what every budding SoundCloud producer wishes for,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone is hoping will happen, \u2018I\u2019ll remix this and then the artist will hear it and I\u2019ll be officially remixing their stuff.\u2019\u201dIn a strange twist of fate, Demon Days, that Gorillaz album Danger Mouse produced, was released by Parlophone, whose parent company is EMI \u2014 the same company that tried to shut down The Grey Album and inadvertently made Danger Mouse a star.\u201c[The Automator] wasn\u2019t busy, the [project just] needed a slightly different approach,\u201d Gorillaz frontman Damon Albarn told MTV in 2005. \u201cDanger Mouse, in my opinion, is one of the best young producers in the world.\u201d\u201cI had a very up-and-down year [in 2004], but it was definitely a big up when I got a chance to [work with Gorillaz],\u201d Burton remarked in the same interview.In just four years after The Grey Album was released, he went from making records in his bedroom to producing albums for Cee-Lo Green [together as Gnarls Barkley], MF Doom [as DangerDoom], and The Rapture, just to name a few. He further cemented his legacy by continuing to produce for artists like A$AP Rocky, Norah Jones, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, and many others.What does the future hold for this industry-changing album? While a legal, EMI-backed release seems unlikely, The Grey Album continues to spark creativity and conversation. Author Charles Fairchild penned a book about it for the popular 33 1/3 book series and successful audio engineer and DJ John Stewart remastered The Grey Album in 2012. But perhaps most importantly, as Holmes Wilson points out, after the album came out, \u201cmusic got a lot less genre-bound, since you didn\u2019t have major label people as a filter anymore. It was like, \u2018we can make whatever kind of music we want,\u2019 which I think became more of a thing as the Internet took over.\u201dAnd what about Danger Mouse\u2019s career? After laying the blueprint of a best-case-scenario career path for aspiring producers, he seems content to play the role of behind-the-scenes conductor for the biggest names in the industry, keeping a low profile on social media and general aloofness about himself. This was proven when one thousand finished copies of The Grey Album vinyl appeared on his doorstep\u2014 its grey discs looking like marble with a new cover now featuring a beautiful cartoon illustration of Jay-Z and The Beatles. Because it took several weeks for the record pressing plant to be finished, the batch arrived well after his initial batch of CDs\u2014well after the cease and desist letters and Grey Tuesday. The vinyl copies were then rendered useless, to be treated as illegal contraband. Instead of selling them, the reclusive producer handed out the marble grey vinyl to his friends, hand-numbering each copy and keeping a log of who had each one to circumvent eBay hawking. This was simply to avoid further threats of litigation from EMI, yet it built up his legend even further.The Grey Album on vinyl.The story of The Grey Album and Danger Mouse\u2019s career in general is fitting for a man who praised The Beatles for veering \u201caway from millions of screaming girls to do something more challenging and meaningful to them\u201d when reflecting on their decision to give up touring for more focused studio work. Whether he becomes more of a public figure or remains clouded in studio mystique, it appears the best of Danger Mouse\u2019s work has yet to come.\u201cI Don\u2019t Remember the Samples I Use.

SPECIAL THANKS TO KATE STULL FOR REQUESTING THE ARTICLE, AND HELPING ME WITH EDITING.One of the most challenging parts of managing a traditional, hierarchical, organization is being responsive to new opportunities; especially those that require leveraging skillsets outside your own team. At Spotify, our organizational model allows us to create, dissolve, and remix teams with a minimal disruption to individuals or managers. This gives us tremendous abilities to address both temporary and long term opportunities.How it used to beAs a manager at Microsoft and Adobe, I was always challenged when there was a problem or opportunity that required repurposing a team or adding on additional scope to an existing team.This kind of thing comes up all the time: a business development opportunity, or integration with another product. Often, this would require small efforts from multiple specialized teams.It would cause disruption as those teams had to change their current plans and had to coordinate around a new challenge while still making progress towards their existing goals. Given that people and resources were managed within the team, and managers were still responsible for delivery of their existing commitments, often it would be hard to motivate them towards supporting this new effort.Creating a new \u201ctiger\u201d team is often the solution in these situations, but that isn\u2019t always an adequate solution for long-term or permanent projects since it essentially punishes the managers of the existing teams and requires finding a new temporary manager for the new team.Another problem in existing organizations is figuring out what to do with a team whose project has been cancelled.If the team is a high-performing team you may try to turn the team onto a new problem, which may or may not be a good fit for their skills and experience. You may instead dissolve the team, assigning the members to new teams based on the needs of those teams rather than the preferences of the individuals. You may leave it up to the individuals to find new roles in the company or face layoffs if they are unsuccessful.These solutions end up punishing both the individuals on the teams and their managers, often for reasons beyond their control. In an organization seeking to innovate (which requires some amount of failure), it sends a counter message to one of experimenting and taking chances.How we remix teams at SpotifyAt Spotify, we wanted to create an organization that allowed us to be dynamic around our staffing, and adaptable in our teams.We embrace failure as being important to learning and innovation, so we didn\u2019t want dissolving a team to be a punishment. We put this new organizational model into effect over two years ago and have been working with it since. In that time, the technical organization has grown from 250 to over 600 people. We went from having three engineering offices to five, and from having 30 teams to over 70.We focused on building full-stack, autonomous teams, built around a single, clear, mission. The expectation is that once the team\u2019s mission has been fulfilled that it will dissolve.To this end, new teams are constantly being created and old teams dissolving, with their members building new teams or moving into existing teams if they need additional staffing. Rather than create a formal manager role for these teams, we decided instead to make the teams collectively responsible for fulfilling their mission.With this model, changing teams does not mean changing your manager, and dissolving a team doesn\u2019t leave a manager looking for a new role.We do have a strong belief in role of the manager as mentor to their reports, so we have a strong managerial culture; it just is manifested in a matrix, rather than hierarchical model.Why Chapter Leads work better than traditional managersOur technical managers are called Chapter Leads. They are usually responsible for managing a narrow range of developer disciplines within their larger organizations, for example: mobile developers, or backend developers. A Chapter Lead usually has direct reports in multiple teams in the organization.For an individual, it is common to change teams, but it is less common to change managers. As each team is responsible for their full stack and all platforms, a team may include members from several chapters.An example is the search team in my organization. Its members come from five different chapters: the backend chapter, the mobile chapter, the keyboard and mouse (desktop and web) chapter, the agile coach chapter, and the test chapter. Additionally, there is a product owner and a UX designer, both of whom are part of the product organization (which is organized more traditionally).The Chapter Leads are not responsible for deliverables directly. Instead, the Chapter Leads are responsible for staffing the teams appropriately; for working with the individuals in the team to help them grow; and for working with the Product Owner and the Agile Coach to make sure that the team is performing well together.Since the Chapter Lead has visibility into multiple teams, they can often identify short or long-term skill set needs and are empowered to resolve them.Sometimes, this means switching two developers in two teams temporarily for a skill set need. Sometimes this means moving a developer into a different team to address a short term staffing need. This also means that if there is a new mission to be addressed, the chapter leads can work together to staff a new team to address that mission out of the existing teams in the organization.A benefit of this model for an individual is that there are many opportunities for them to work on new projects or develop new skillsets since there are new projects spinning up on a regular clip.When and how we remix and dissolve teamsThis remixing is not constant throughout the technology team. We do have several very long-lived teams that are focused on features in the product, but even those teams will shift people between each other based on short or long-term needs. In some parts of the organization, specifically the infrastructure teams, they tend to be focused on short-term projects and are creating new teams more often. Those teams dissolve when they have completed their project.We will also dissolve teams if we believe that their mission is no longer necessary. Usually this is the result of the team invalidating their mission themselves. We celebrate these conclusions just as much as the successful completion of the project, since we value the lessons from a \u201cfailed\u201d project. Celebrating your failures as valuable lessons encourages risk taking, experimentation and innovation.By striving towards a model that gives the individual consistency (their manager, and their Chapter) while still giving the organization fluidity and adaptability, we\u2019ve found a happy balance that lets us extend our agile-first values beyond the work that a team performs to the organization as a whole. This has allowed us to focus on innovation and leverage opportunities that slower-moving organizations would have difficulty addressing.Several companies have attempted to adapt our model but there is something critical to understand. Our organization model itself is fluid and continues to change and evolve to support the needs of the organization. The specifics of our implementation are less important than the underlying values and ideals that created it.If you want the benefits of a dynamic organization, you will need to build something that is suited to the values of your own organization. I would argue that a central requirement is endowing teams with autonomy and decision-making authority. If you cannot support this, then you should look instead to adapt your existing model to remove impediments and bottlenecks instead.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Agile", "Spotify", "Management"]}, {"title": "Introducing Remix Scheduling: the first scheduling product that lets you explore every option", "post_link": "https://blog.remix.com/introducing-remix-scheduling-the-first-scheduling-product-that-lets-you-explore-every-option-27b9fde1b735?source=search_post---------8", "author_name": "Tiffany Chu", "author_link": "https://blog.remix.com/@tchu88", "publish_date": "2018-01-10", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-18", "readtime": "3.65", "claps": 310, "voters": 42, "content": "Introducing Remix Scheduling: the first scheduling product that lets you explore every optionTiffany ChuFollowJan 10, 2018 \u00b7 4 min readSince we started Remix three years ago, our product development philosophy has centered around understanding the problems transit agencies face. We\u2019ve been lucky to partner with over 225 agencies across 10 countries, and build a global community that actively shapes what we design everyday.We created Remix Planning so agencies could envision and define their transit plans. Since then, the biggest question we\u2019ve gotten is this:Once the plan is approved, how do I actually take that plan and implement it? How do I launch new service on the street for my riders?Today, we\u2019re excited to answer that question and announce the launch of our next product, Remix Scheduling \u2014 the first scheduling product designed to let you explore every option.Aligning Remix\u2019s product roadmap to the transit agency process.Three initial insights \ud83d\udca1Over the last few years, we\u2019ve been doing research and development with agencies on their scheduling processes, and here\u2019s what we learned:It\u2019s time-consuming. We saw agencies spending 2\u20133 months per bid developing new schedules. We\u2019ve heard that some places will actively not change their service, even if they\u2019re suffering from critical issues like poor on-time-performance \u2014 simply because there\u2019s not enough staff time to redo the schedule. In the end, this costs agencies both financially and in the quality of service for riders.It\u2019s a difficult discipline to learn. It can take years to fully understand the nuts and bolts of scheduling (blocking, runcutting, rostering, etc.). Pair that with steep learning curves for existing tools, and you\u2019ll understand why people say things like \u201cthere\u2019s a scheduler shortage across the industry\u201d and \u201cit takes 7 years to become a scheduler.\u201dIt\u2019s a black box. Without a clear understanding of what inputs are needed for a good schedule to come out, drivers, union leads, planners, executives, and other departments don\u2019t know which scenarios are truly feasible until it\u2019s too late. How often has an aspirational 15-minute frequency been watered down to 20 or 25 minutes, due to unforeseen resource constraints?Three guiding principles \u2728With those in mind, we built Remix Scheduling based on the critical needs identified by agencies:\u26a1\ufe0f Try scenarios fast \u2014 explore every option in minutes, not hours.\ud83d\udc41 Show the impact \u2014 scheduling is all about difficult operational tradeoffs, so immediately visualize how those affect costs and people.\ud83d\udd0e Make it easy to understand \u2014 with intuitive design and a low barrier to entry, it should be easy to get input early on, when it matters most.In short, you should never settle for an option because you don\u2019t have time to find a better one. Here\u2019s a two-minute peek:What\u2019s insideOur engineering team spent two years developing blocking, runcutting, and rostering algorithms based on state-of-the-art optimization techniques. We then surrounded them in an easy-to-use interface that gives your team full control over the details of their schedules. A few things we\u2019re most excited by:Seamless integration with Remix Planning \u2014 Take routes and timetables directly from the planners and immediately build blockings, runcuts, and rosters on top. This ensures that scheduling can easily carry the planning vision through.Interactive blocking \u2014 Assign trips to vehicles with a drag-and-drop interface that makes it easy (and kinda fun) to spot and correct inefficiencies.Remix Runcut Explorer \u2014 Instead of repetitively adjusting parameters and waiting for a new runcut, get 60 options all at once. Then evaluate them instantaneously to find the one that balances the needs of your drivers with your budget.With the technical power of Remix Scheduling alongside Remix Planning, all of your transit ideas can live in one place, end-to-end, from the big vision all the way down to detailed implementation.Behind the scenes: sketching and co-creating the product with partner agencies. Here\u2019s a whiteboard session we did with The Bus in Merced, CA (on the left) that led to the design of Remix\u2019s visual runcut interface (on the right).Results so farOf course, new technology is meaningless unless it achieves impact. Together with our agencies, we\u2019ve seen some exciting results already:Connect Transit in Bloomington-Normal, IL saved $294,000 annually by successfully trying out interlining for the first time.GLTC in Lynchburg, VA eliminated all of their major split shifts, leading to 100% driver retention after their latest bid.AVTA in Lancaster, CA is preparing to launch the world\u2019s first all-electric fleet this year, using Remix to schedule the entire thing.None of this would have been possible without two crucial parts: first, the 15 agencies who participated in our Early Customer Program and believed in the value of this work \u2014 we can\u2019t thank you enough. And second, the writers of TRB\u2019S Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) Report 135 \u2014 you taught our team the fundamentals of transit scheduling (we were the ones that bought out your entire book supply last year).We can\u2019t wait to see more transit agencies expand access in their communities and make their plans real.Want to learn more about Remix Scheduling?

It means you (yes, you!) can reuse the code from another project on Glitch, tweak it or personalize it to make it your own, and share your improvements with the world. But it\u2019s easier to show you than to tell you.Enter the MeatballNASA (the United States\u2019 National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has had a series of logos over the years, each of them differently awesome.NASA calls the blue circle logo the \u201cmeatball\u201d, which seems a little hurtful tbhIf you\u2019re really into NASA logos, there are lots of different histories of where they all came from and how they\u2019re used. Spend some time learning about how the awesome 70s-era \u201cworm\u201d logo was wrongly set adrift into space.BEHOLD THE SPACE WORMBut back here on Earth, our friends in the Glitch community have found some fun new ways to make the NASA logo a lot more personal, and to show off the power of remixing on Glitch.First, Dan Reeves (with an assist from Tom Hazledine and Cornwall Geeks) created the \u201cMake your own NASA logo\u201d project on Glitch:GlitchThe community that helps you build the app or bot of your dreamsglitch.comThis auspicious start was announced with a simple, fun tweet:And of course, that\u2019s awesome enough on its own. But in this initial, quick implementation, Dan\u2019s version had a separate text input that you had to type your message into before it would be added to the custom-animated NASA logo.That\u2019s where the fun of remixing comes in. On any Glitch project, you can view the code for yourself (tip: just go to glitch.com/~projectname to see the code, which in this case is glitch.com/~nasa).Jordan Scales did exactly that, and made some slight improvements, announced with this delighted tweet:And you can see the out-of-this-world results for yourself with the new Nasafy:GlitchThe community that helps you build the app or bot of your dreamsglitch.comOr, just check out the Nasafy app, which now has inline editing to make your own fun, animated NASA-style logo.

Poi, all\u2019improvviso, un flash. Se Rossella \u00e8 dal suo ragazzo a Trezzano, di chi era quel reggiseno sulla sedia in salotto? Certo non di una che ha dormito con Alessio: da quando abitiamo insieme (\u00e8 un anno a settembre) non l\u2019ho mai sentito parlare di donne. E certo non della tipa di Matteo, visto che fa la pattinatrice e si sta allenando in Germania per i campionati italiani.C\u2019\u00e8 qualcosa che non mi torna. Magari uno dei due \u00e8 un amante del travestimento e arrotonda il budget a mia insaputa. Intorno a casa, tutta la zona di viale Certosa \u00e8 sempre un viavai di trans, prostitute e padri di famiglia che, di notte, fanno la spola con le loro macchine di lusso: in fondo non ci sarebbe niente di male ad approfittare di quello che chiede il mercato. Si chiama \u201cEconomia creativa\u201d.Ormai ho la pulce all\u2019orecchio, stasera indagher\u00f2 meglio (ma anche no, cavoli loro).Oh, finalmente: ecco l\u2019autobus. \u00c8 completamente ricoperto \u2014 finestrini compresi \u2014 dalla pubblicit\u00e0 di uno smartphone, e continuo a chiedermi se esiste davvero, nell\u2019intero universo, una sola persona capace di comprare un cellulare da ottocento euro perch\u00e9 ci foderano i mezzi pubblici come orate al cartoccio. Se esiste tale essere umano, mi sento in dovere di salvare il mondo prima che il virus si propaghi.Il traffico sembra regolare: semafori permettendo, sar\u00f2 a Porta Genova tra quaranta minuti. La riunione \u00e8 alle undici, potrei anche farcela (altrimenti sfrutter\u00f2 questo tempo per inventarmi una scusa).Mi immagino la scena: io che mi fumo gli ultimi duecento metri facendo il record del mondo su strada, entro al coworking sudato come un maratoneta, schizzo verso la mia postazione e, in quel preciso istante, vedo arrivarmi un Whatsapp di Mark che mi avvisa che lui e Stefania sono ancora in taxi e \u201cScusaci, facciamo il prima possibile\u201d.Oppure, seconda ipotesi: io che rimango imbottigliato per strada, provo a chiamare Mark ma ho finito il credito, gli scrivo un Whatsapp ma non c\u2019\u00e8 campo, gli mando un\u2019e-mail ma non la legge, inizia a sanguinarmi il naso per lo stress, entro al coworking imbrattato come Carrie in Lo sguardo di Satana e, in quel preciso istante, vedo Gloria allungarmi un biglietto che mi avvisa che per me \u201cMiss Italia finisce\u201d.Stacco.Una signora di fronte a me mi guarda con aria perplessa.Ma sono davvero io quello che sta andando in sclero per una cazzo di sveglia?Poi dicono che noi napoletani la facciamo sempre facile. Prima di trasferirmi qui a Milano non mi sarei mai sognato di pensare che dieci minuti di ritardo avrebbero potuto rovinarmi la vita.E se adesso spegnessi il cellulare? Cosa succederebbe se non fossi raggiungibile anche semplicemente per un\u2019ora? Ma soprattutto: che valore dovrei dare a quest\u2019ansia di essere sempre connesso, sempre reattivo e sempre disponibile rispetto a quei quattro fagioli che mi metto in tasca?Spesso mi sembra che l\u2019unica libert\u00e0 di un Libero Professionista sia scegliere il font per le fatture.Tutto il resto, nella migliore delle ipotesi, \u00e8 un dovere e nella peggiore \u00e8 schiavismo. E non solo nei confronti dei clienti, che (giustamente?) hanno il coltello dalla parte del manico, ma anche nei confronti della burocrazia, che genera pi\u00f9 mostri del sonno della ragione.Un giorno capir\u00f2, per esempio, perch\u00e9 su duemila-e-rotti euro che fatturo ogni mese me ne rimangono meno della met\u00e0. O perch\u00e9 \u00e8 normale che me li saldino (ammesso e non concesso che lo facciano) a centottanta giorni, o perch\u00e9 \u00e8 legale che io paghi delle tasse su soldi che non ho mai incassato.Un giorno capir\u00f2 perch\u00e9 su una multa o su una bolletta si applica la mora dopo un secondo che \u00e8 scaduta, e sulle mie fatture nemmeno dopo un anno.E un giorno capir\u00f2 perch\u00e9 non ho nessuna tutela di nessun genere a fronte di tutti i contributi che verso a non so nemmeno chi o cosa.Un giorno, ma non oggi.

Molto rumore per nulla.Attraverso sgomitando il ponte pedonale sulla ferrovia (perfetta metafora della mia esistenza), e mi avvio a passo spedito verso via Savona pronto, come ogni giorno, a immergermi nella nuova \u201cMilano da bere\u201d: la \u201cMilano Imbruttita\u201d.

E comecei o Catarro Verde quando blog era a \u00fanica possibilidade de express\u00e3o autoral independente na internet, se a pessoa n\u00e3o fosse um jornalista dono de site.Clara: Meu blog nasceu como continua\u00e7\u00e3o da minha coluna no CardosOnline, mailzine que eu fazia com mais sete mo\u00e7os e que durou de 1998 a 2001. Acho que posso dizer que fomos a primeira manifesta\u00e7\u00e3o liter\u00e1ria na internet e quando acabou uma galera ficou meio \u00f3rf\u00e3. T\u00ednhamos 5 mil assinantes, era gente pra caramba pra \u00e9poca, e eu recebia muitos emails de gente pedindo pra eu continuar publicando em algum lugar com certa periodicidade. Eu at\u00e9 tinha um site com as minhas colunas, mas n\u00e3o sabia mexer com html direito e morri de pregui\u00e7a de aprender. A\u00ed um amigo me apresentou o blog e eu falei: ta\u00ed. F\u00e1cil de publicar, f\u00e1cil de mexer, \u00e9 isso.2. Por que achou que ter um blog era uma boa ideia? O que um blog representava para voc\u00ea nesse in\u00edcio?Gabriel: No in\u00edcio, era uma autoafirma\u00e7\u00e3o dentro do curso de Desenho Industrial. Um espa\u00e7o pra se mostrar engra\u00e7ado e conseguir certa relev\u00e2ncia (leia-se: pegar gente). Na segunda fase, com um blog particular, era o \u00fanico lugar que eu podia escrever tendo certeza que algu\u00e9m estava lendo. Acho importante dizer que nessa \u00e9poca (2001 \u2014 2002) poucas pessoas possu\u00edam blogs, mas muitas pessoas visitavam. Ent\u00e3o era comum voc\u00ea ter comentaristas cl\u00e1ssicos, que eram pessoas que n\u00e3o tinham blog mas interagiam muito com quem tinha (esses comentaristas hoje em dia s\u00e3o as pessoas famosas). De certo modo, isso que tornava os blogs famosos. A gente n\u00e3o tinha um alcance absurdo como hoje os blogs t\u00eam, mas mesmo assim existiam webcelebridades. Gente que t\u00e1 em evid\u00eancia at\u00e9 hoje, que construiu uma carreira em cima dessa fama do in\u00edcio do s\u00e9culo.S\u00e9rgio: O Catarro Verde era a minha \u00fanica possibilidade de express\u00e3o autoral independente na internet. Foi o primeiro \u2018ad free blog\u2019, zero publicidade. At\u00e9 hoje \u00e9 assim. Nada est\u00e1 \u00e0 venda no Catarro Verde. Foi necess\u00e1rio pagar ao Blogspot para meus leitores ficarem livres do banner obrigat\u00f3rio.Inagaki: Naqueles tempos pr\u00e9-redes sociais, blogs \u2014 e seus espa\u00e7os para coment\u00e1rios \u2014 eram o grande ponto de encontro das pessoas. Um blog era como se fosse o recanto virtual de uma pessoa, na qual ela recebia os amigos. Voc\u00ea recebia um coment\u00e1rio e depois visitava o blog do outro, como quem d\u00e1 um pulo na casa de um amigo pra tomar um cafezinho ou uma cervejinha. Os links de um blogroll eram como linhas de metr\u00f4 que voc\u00ea pegava para visitar, sem escalas e sem precisar pegar uma baldea\u00e7\u00e3o, a casa de um camarada.Al\u00e9m disso, por ser jornalista de forma\u00e7\u00e3o, posso dizer que o blog representou uma baita v\u00e1lvula de escape pra mim. Afinal, era no Pensar Enlouquece que eu podia escrever sobre qualquer assunto que me desse na telha, livre de pautas pr\u00e9-definidas, deadlines de entrega e limita\u00e7\u00e3o na quantidade de caracteres, tendo controle absoluto sobre meu texto final.3. Quem voc\u00ea considera relevante nessa primeira fase dos blogs no Brasil? Por favor, diga o nome do autor, o nome do blog e por que era relevante.Clarissa: o Thiago Capanema, do n\u00e3o v\u00e1 se perder por a\u00ed, foi nossa refer\u00eancia inicial de formato e de como era poss\u00edvel fazer um neg\u00f3cio legal, com estilo, a partir da plataforma de blog. eu lia muito a clarah averbuck (do brazileira!preta, nome fant\u00e1stico) e o inagaki (pensar enlouquece, ainda na ativa!) tamb\u00e9m. e amava o jesus, me chicoteia do marco aur\u00e9lio gois dos santos (atualmente redator do cqc).Edney: O Denis do Concatenum.com foi o primeiro blog que eu li, conhecia o Denis desde 89 e a partir dele conheci outros blogs, acho que a maioria saiu do ar j\u00e1.Daniela: A Cora Ronai, Alexandre Inagaki, Clara Averbuck, Neozeitgeist, Rosana Hermann, Fal Vitielo \u2014 isso lembrando assim por alto.4. Por favor, fa\u00e7a um resuminho da hist\u00f3ria do seu blog. Ele morreu, ainda existe, as transforma\u00e7\u00f5es ou fases por que passou, se criou outros\u2026Daniela: Eu tive a ideia de fazer a par\u00f3dia de um jornal, sempre distorcendo not\u00edcias di\u00e1rias \u2014 como essas not\u00edcias seriam se fosse no meu particular mundo perfeito. O Blog come\u00e7ou no blogspot, depois foi para um dom\u00ednio pr\u00f3prio, ganhou outras \u00e1reas al\u00e9m das not\u00edcias, sendo os geradores as mais lembradas (engra\u00e7ado que at\u00e9 hoje ningu\u00e9m conseguiu reproduzir os geradores da mesma forma que eu criei, com tantas vari\u00e1veis). Depois disso fui convidada a fazer parte do portal Terra (junto com o Nelito do Eu Hein fomos os primeiros blogs a fazer parte de portais) \u2014 depois do Terra recebi uma proposta do Aol. O Mundo Perfeito acabou porque nenhuma piada pode ser contada por muito tempo, acho que o criador tem que saber o tempo de vida das suas cria\u00e7\u00f5es. Tive v\u00e1rios outros projetos na Internet \u2014 muitos mais ligados \u00e0 literatura do que o humor. Quando fiz coisas ligadas \u00e0 ironia e humor fiz anonimamente. Prefiro me preservar. Popularidade n\u00e3o \u00e9 para mim.Fl\u00e1via: O meu blog surgiu em outubro de 2000 no Blogger/Blogspot. Teve algumas fases de atualiza\u00e7\u00e3o mais intensa, outras mais \u201cbola de feno\u201d, mas nunca o encerrei. Somente esse ano mudei de ferramenta de publica\u00e7\u00e3o e fui para o Wordpress pois infelizmente o Google abandonou muito o Blogger. Sou bem apegada aos servi\u00e7os que uso e levei anos pra aceitar que a mudan\u00e7a era inevit\u00e1vel, hahaha.Tive umas fases mais diarinho virtual, principalmente quando estava me estabilizando na profiss\u00e3o e em morar em S\u00e3o Paulo e compartilhava com os leitores as ang\u00fastias dos 20 e poucos anos! *rs e Tive um boom em 2001, na \u00e9poca do 11 de setembro, quando fiz uma cobertura em tempo real da repercuss\u00e3o do atentado na imprensa mundial. Tive fases mais politizadas, como na \u00e9poca das Elei\u00e7\u00f5es de 2002, na qual cheguei at\u00e9 a criar um blog coletivo paralelo para apoiar o Lula. Mas depois passei a falar somente de cultura pop, especialmente de m\u00fasica, que sempre foi a minha primeira paix\u00e3o.Cheguei a ter outros blogs paralelos mas o mais conhecido foi o Del\u00edcias Cremosas, que rolou entre 2001 e 2006 e foi o primeiro blog coletivo de mulheres falando de sexo abertamente. Na \u00e9poca deu muito o que falar e foi bem divertido. Mas infelizmente aconteceu em uma \u00e9poca em que blog n\u00e3o dava fama e nem dinheiro. *rsClarissa: o garotas come\u00e7ou em 11 de abril de 2003, com um post publicado por mim, que consistia em: \u201c1, 2, 3 e j\u00e1! Come\u00e7ou!\u201d.fl\u00e1via, vivi e eu decidimos fazer o blog porque t\u00ednhamos trabalhado juntas e sido demitidas no mesmo dia. quer\u00edamos um lugar que amarrasse nossa conviv\u00eancia, permitisse que a gente, de alguma forma, continuasse trabalhando juntas \u2014 apesar de termos convivido, as tr\u00eas, por seis meses apenas no trabalho, acho que tivemos uma identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de estilo e de refer\u00eancias quase imediata.no come\u00e7o, post\u00e1vamos 3 vezes por dia \u2013 um texto de cada autora por dia.depois que fomos linkadas na coluna oops, do ricardo feltrin, da folha, a audi\u00eancia estourou. da\u00ed, fomos convidadas pelo alu\u00edzio falc\u00e3o, que estava assumindo a dire\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e9poca, a fazer uma coluna na revista. isso foi bem in\u00e9dito \u00e0 \u00e9poca: acho que foi o primeiro caso de blog que extrapolou a m\u00eddia online.depois de uns dois anos, reformulamos o layout do garotas e passamos a escrever seis textos por semana \u2013 dois de cada autora por semana.e, finalmente, fizemos uma parceria com o ig, quando a marcela tavares era coordenadora dessa \u00e1rea, web 2.0. ent\u00e3o passamos a fazer parte do portal.nesse meio tempo, teve tamb\u00e9m o f\u00f3rum de leitores, que juntou muita gente legal e que eu conhe\u00e7o at\u00e9 hoje. e teve o livro, pela matrix, com as melhores cr\u00f4nicas do garotas.vixe, foi muita coisa.em novembro de 2008, anunciamos o fim. e encerramos em dezembro do mesmo ano. o \u00faltimo post foi algo do tipo \u201c3, 2, 1. acabou\u201d. e tamb\u00e9m foi postado por mim. \u263aalgum tempo depois, o blog saiu do ar.5. Por que parou de blogar (caso tenha parado)? Por que continua blogando (caso continue)?Inagaki: Porque eu continuo gostando de escrever e de compartilhar conte\u00fados interessantes. O tempo dispon\u00edvel pra atualizar meu blog diminuiu muito de l\u00e1 para c\u00e1, mas creio que continuarei mantendo o Pensar Enlouquece no ar por muito tempo ainda.Fl\u00e1via: Continuo blogando no www.flaviadurante.net e n\u00e3o pretendo parar nunca, pra mim \u00e9 uma ferramenta t\u00e3o corriqueira quanto o e-mail, Facebook ou Twitter. Sou uma comunicadora e gosto de me expressar de v\u00e1rias formas.Chico: Acho que a culpa \u00e9 do Twitter. Tenho me divertido mais com o \u201cao vivo\u201d.6. O que mudou na sua vida pelo fato de voc\u00ea ter sido um blogueiro de primeira hora? Como isso impactou no seu trabalho e na sua vida pessoal?Gabriel: O Dequejeito me fez ter contato com um monte de gente bacana, que hoje em dia \u00e9 muito importante. De certo modo, a minha carreira profissional \u00e9 um resultado direto desses contatos. Na fase do TDUL eu at\u00e9 ganhava dinheiro, mas jamais pensei em parar de trabalhar pra ser blogueiro profissional. Considero meu trabalho melhor do que ser blogueiro. Eu sou respons\u00e1vel por fazer marcas patrocinarem blogueiros, hahah. Acho bonito pensar que eu ajudo a financiar essa zuera toda. E ter os contatos certos faz toda diferen\u00e7a nesse neg\u00f3cio.Vida pessoal: Eu sou uma pessoa bastante t\u00edmida O blog foi o respons\u00e1vel por me fazer ter contato com gente que eu jamais teria chance de conhecer (inclusive amorosamente haha). E, justamente por ser um blogueiro de primeira hora, eu conheci pessoas que hoje em dia s\u00e3o muito importantes na web, pessoas que hoje tem programa de TV, que s\u00e3o relevantes tanto diretamente como no backstage da internet. Acho isso lindo. Os momentos favoritos da minha vida s\u00e3o por causa do blog, desde \u201cser o par de uma atriz da globo quando ela fazia presen\u00e7a vip no bar mitzvah do filho de um milion\u00e1rio\u201d, passando por \u201cfumar ~um~ com o elenco da malha\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d, at\u00e9 poder \u201cemprestar minha casa para a lua de mel do futuro criador do Cersibon\u201d.Rosana: Quase tudo o que fa\u00e7o hoje veio do blog. Palestras, viagens, trabalho. Minha atividade principal, no entanto, como roteirista, antecede o blog.Rafael: Tudo, absolutamente tudo. Foi por causa deles que conheci muitos dos meus melhores amigos. Me ajudou a arrumar empregos. Toco at\u00e9 hoje no Bazar Pamplona com o Pinguim, que entrou em contato comigo depois de ouvir as grava\u00e7\u00f5es caseiras que eu publicava no meu blog. Eu n\u00e3o fico pensando muito sobre isso, mas \u00e9 algo que mudou profundamente a minha vida pessoal e profissional.7. O que voc\u00ea acha da monetiza\u00e7\u00e3o \u2014 os publis e cong\u00eaneres \u2014 que s\u00f3 vieram mais tarde?Rafael: Se \u00e9 algo feito com honestidade, transpar\u00eancia e bom senso e permite \u00e0s pessoas ganharem a vida com aquilo de que gostam, \u00f3timo.Daniela: Eu acho justo voc\u00ea ganhar dinheiro por um trabalho que faz sucesso, mas tamb\u00e9m acho que as pessoas t\u00eam que ter responsabilidades. Anunciar produto sem avisar que \u00e9 an\u00fancio \u00e9 uma grande sacanagem e ainda acho sempre bom ter responsabilidade com o que se anuncia. Promover semana de vida saud\u00e1vel patrocinada por fast food ou refrigerante \u00e9 picaretagem e o que essas mo\u00e7as fitness fazem hoje para vender no instagram \u00e9 inomin\u00e1vel e deveria ser criminalizado. \u00c9 ganhar dinheiro sem ter escr\u00fapulo.Chico: Acho muito bom. Ganhar dinheiro \u00e9 show, espero que todos ganhem muito.8. Quem voc\u00eas l\u00eaem hoje? Do que voc\u00eas mais gostam? Do que n\u00e3o gostam?Gabriel: Pouqu\u00edssima coisa. Eu leio blogs por causa do trabalho, mas n\u00e3o porque gosto deles. N\u00e3o existe nenhum blog que eu goste como antigamente. Queria algu\u00e9m que mantivesse um di\u00e1rio da sua vida. Hoje em dia parece que cada blog \u00e9 obrigado a ter um tema, uma categoria. Ningu\u00e9m mais fala da vida pessoal, nem que seja mentindo. Se eu quiser saber de moda, tem uma lista de blogs de moda. Se eu quiser saber de memes, tem outros 500 blogs\u2026 Parece que n\u00e3o existe mais aquela surpresa gostosa de visitar o blog de uma pessoa que voc\u00ea s\u00f3 conhece por foto, e ela t\u00e1 falando sobre ter deixado, sem querer, cair um figo dentro do queijo ralado no buffet, e a pessoa que tava atr\u00e1s na fila achou que era uma pr\u00e1tica interessante e resolveu copiar.Fl\u00e1via: Leio blogs sobre moda plus size, como o da Ju Romano (http://juromano.com) e sobre m\u00fasica, como o Don\u2019t Skip (http://dontskip.com).Clarissa: posso responder por mim: leio o feed das minhas redes sociais (e chego aos conte\u00fados indicados por elas). n\u00e3o existe mais um ve\u00edculo em que eu entre, exclusivamente, pela home \u2013 a n\u00e3o ser o buzzfeed, para o qual trabalho.fora da internet leio jornal (de fim de semana) e livros, como sempre li \u2013 mas no kindle! : )Clara: Quest\u00e3o de G\u00eanero, da Jarid Arraes; Ativismo de sof\u00e1; Blogueiras feministas; 2beauty.com.br que tem uns tutoriais de make \u00f3timos\u2026 Basicamente, feminismo e maquiagem. Sim, pode. N\u00e3o, n\u00e3o \u00e9 contradit\u00f3rio.9. Qual \u00e9 o presente dos blogs? E o futuro dos blogs?Rafael: Talvez hoje n\u00e3o se use mais o termo com tanta frequ\u00eancia, mas basicamente tudo \u00e9 blog ou deriva do blog. O Twitter, o Tumblr, o Gizmodo, o Verge, o BuzzFeed. \u00c9 muito prov\u00e1vel que o que venha no futuro tamb\u00e9m tenha raiz no blog.Inagaki: As inova\u00e7\u00f5es que foram trazidas pelos blogs, como o espa\u00e7o de coment\u00e1rios e as atualiza\u00e7\u00f5es constantes facilitadas por plataformas como Wordpress, acabaram sendo pulverizadas. Pode-se dizer, pois, que houve uma \u201cbloguiza\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d da web. Os coment\u00e1rios se dispersaram e acabaram migrando para as redes sociais, assim como a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de conte\u00fados feitos por quem se habituou \u00e0 autopublica\u00e7\u00e3o sem intermedia\u00e7\u00e3o de editores. Muito do poder de fogo dos blogs migrou, pois, para os vlogs e redes sociais, mas \u00e9 bom lembrar que todos s\u00e3o apenas ferramentas. Blogs n\u00e3o morreram e n\u00e3o morrer\u00e3o.Rosana: O forte dos blogs hoje \u00e9 o colunismo opinativo. Quase todos os portais t\u00eam seus times de blogueiros, seus comentaristas, analistas, especialistas. E tem os blogs de nicho que s\u00e3o sempre fortes, em \u00e1reas de tecnologia, games, s\u00e9ries, moda, fitness, literatura, m\u00fasica, etc. Os blogs perderam audi\u00eancia em coment\u00e1rios para as redes sociais, mas n\u00e3o perderam a relev\u00e2ncia, porque o que conta s\u00e3o os conte\u00fados e seus produtores.Ficou a fim de ler as entrevistas na \u00edntegra? \u00c9 s\u00f3 baixar o nosso suplemento especial.>>> PDF>>> ePub (para iPad ou iPhone)", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "The United States API, and how Remix uses it", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@dget/the-united-states-api-and-how-remix-uses-it-5c4b21f5b332?source=search_post", "author_name": "Dan Getelman", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@dget", "publish_date": "2015-11-10", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-09", "readtime": "3.95", "claps": 38, "voters": 38, "content": "The United States API, and how Remix uses itDan GetelmanFollowNov 10, 2015 \u00b7 4 min readOpen data is here, and is being used to help build businesses and help cities make better decisions. For years, technologists have been clamoring for governments to open up more of their data. It\u2019s now happening. Cities of all sizes, from San Francisco to Asheville have open data portals filled with machine-readable data. Los Angeles, San Diego, and Philadelphia, among others, have even created executive Chief Data Officer positions that are responsible for opening data across departments. But, now that the data is out there, how is it actually getting used?I can tell you what we\u2019re up to at Remix. We\u2019re a quickly growing company that uses open data to help cities plan out better public transit. Here\u2019s a couple of examples of how we take open data, and make it available for cities to make better decisions. I\u2019ve also linked to sources and places you can find all the data we use, so be sure to follow the links! (Plug: If you\u2019re interested in building great interfaces using open data, we\u2019re hiring front-end engineers!)OpenStreetMap and its ecosystemA blank map of Oakland inside Remix.Everything in Remix is built on OpenStreetMap and different services and software packages in its ecosystem. In the photo above, all of the data you see in the map is coming from OpenStreetMap. We use Mapbox as a service to both generate the tiles that make up the map imagery, and to keep them up to date. OpenStreetMap has matured incredibly over the last couple of years, and offers us a number of advantages. First, the data is both accurate and easy to change. This is incredibly valuable to us, since it means that our customers immediately have correct data. And if it\u2019s not quite right, it\u2019s very easy to contribute those fixes back and quickly have them reflected in our product.Drawing a new line in Remix, using Valhalla.One of the coolest advantages of OpenStreetMap, though, is in our routing. We\u2019re able to use Valhalla, a project from Mapzen, to do dynamic routing. This lets us snap to roads as you draw routes. Being able to do that based on the easily updatable data I mentioned above is cool in itself, but there\u2019s another advantage. OpenStreetMap actually has a tag for bus-only roads (psv, for \u201cpublic service vehicle\u201d), which means that we can use existing metadata to route bus lines over bus-only roads. This would be impossible with any other standard routing engine.Using GTFS To Show Planners Their NetworkOur users are transit planners \u2014 the city employees that decide where each bus goes, and how often it shows up. Without open data, often the best representation of their current transit system is the printed paper schedule. However, in recent years, agencies have begun publishing all of their schedule data in a format called the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS). You can usually find this data on the transit agency\u2019s website, or on aggregators like TransitFeeds.This data is output directly by the cities\u2019 bus scheduling systems, and is far too granular to be directly useful by the planners. It also comes in a zip of CSVs, which isn\u2019t easily digestable either. But it\u2019s in a machine-readable format, and that has let us do a bit of magic to work backwards from the super-granular schedule back to their intent. We can take open data to give cities better ideas of the systems they\u2019re running.The existing system of AC Transit, in the San Francisco Bay Area\u2019s East Bay.Using the Census to drive better decisionsI\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention the US Census, or \u201cthe original open data\u201d, as my colleague Danny refers to it. The Census has been around since 1790, but can often be unwieldy to work with. We\u2019ve been able to take this data, all of which is freely available, and place it right in front of transit planners when they\u2019re making decisions.Population density for Oakland.We were able to use some great existing open source tools, such as PostGIS, GDAL, Mapnik, and Tilestache to generate maps for a variety of factors, like population, jobs, people with low incomes, seniors, and more.An example of the data we\u2019re able to show for a given bus route.We\u2019re also able to take the high granularity of the Census data, and give an instant calculation of how many people are near a route, and their demographic characteristics. To get this kind of insight before, agencies would have had to go through an arduous analysis process. However, because the data is openly available, we\u2019re able to build it right into the product and make it available at their fingertips.The ImpactThe important piece of this isn\u2019t that open data is pretty, but that it gives city transit planners the information they need to help justify and make better decisions. Our team hears from planners from cities of all sizes, from Marvin in Sandusky to Max near Seattle, about how Remix has changed the way they make changes, and allowed them to more efficiently evaluate and justify alternatives.

In this related post, we talked with the team\u2019s six engineers about the problems they\u2019re solving, from classic algorithm design to building complex visualizations. (The engineering team is hiring, BTW. See open roles here and email the team if you\u2019re interested: jobs@remix.com.)What is Remix and why does it matter?Tiffany: Remix is a platform to help cities plan transit. We primarily help city planners design routes and get an immediate understanding of the cost and demographic impact of any proposed changes. Currently, we\u2019re working with about 200 cities around the world, primarily in the U.S., but also in nine other countries. They use Remix to plan everything from day-to-day operations and short-range service changes to long-range transit visions reaching decades into the future.Left to right: Tiffany, Sam, Dan, and Danny on the office\u2019s roof.Sam: Before Remix, there was no effective way to demonstrate the impact of public transportation on the people in a city. Now, a lot of agencies and individuals are using Remix to convince their city councils that specific routes should exist. For folks who live inside cities, public transit is the single biggest thing determining what kind of opportunities they have, how many jobs they have access to, even the kinds of relationships they can have. We\u2019re helping cities realize, \u201cHey, if we make these changes, we can have a real impact on thousands of people.\u201d\u201cPublic transit is the single biggest thing determining what kind of opportunities people in cities have.\u201d \u2013SamHow did you come up with the idea for Remix? Give us the genesis story.Sam: We were all fellows in Code for America, which is where we met. The fellowship included time together in San Francisco, as well as each of us working independently in different cities. We sat near each other in the San Francisco office, and discovered we are all passionate about transportation and building more livable cities. On the side, we started talking to urban planners and we learned one big, universal truth: most of their important decisions happen on giant sheets of paper. They literally sketch it out, look at it, and use their best judgment to figure out what\u2019s best for their city.It\u2019s really challenging to make those decisions without responsive visualizations and the ability to cross-reference multiple data sets. So we started a side project that we didn\u2019t think too much about at first. We built something so you could sketch a bus route on an online map and see how much it would cost, who would ride it, and whether it\u2019d be a good investment. Somehow it got picked up by this planning blog and \u2014 almost overnight \u2014 all these planners started using it and emailing us saying, \u201cOh my god, I have been dreaming about something like this for years.\u201dDan: One guy literally said \u201cI love you.\u201dSam: And then, of course, each email would have a dozen feature requests. The whole thing started out as a little side experiment, but when we saw planners actually using it to map out city bus routes, we thought, \u201cWhat would happen if we started a company?\u201d That was two and a half years ago, and here we are.This is what it takes to reimagine the future of cities: collaboration, conversation, concentration.What drew you to public transportation in the first place?Dan: I\u2019m originally from New York City. I had this really fun hour-and-40-minute subway commute each way to and from high school, which would have been a 20-minute drive. So I spent a lot of time wondering why that was. After studying business and computer science in college, I kept coming back to an interest in government infrastructure. I think it\u2019s so cool that you can walk outside of our office, and almost everything you see was originally built by the city. After college, I applied for transportation planning internships and was rejected by all of them.Tiffany: Really? You never told us that!Dan: Yep. Then I came across Code for America. I realized I could use my software technology and product skills to make a difference inside government. I thought government is where I\u2019d end up. If you asked me what I would be doing after Code for America, living on a sheep farm on another continent would have come before working for a startup.\u201cI realized I could use my software technology and product skills to make a difference inside government.\u201d \u2013DanTiffany: The fact that I grew up on a cul-de-sac in suburban, central New Jersey very much cemented the importance of access to me. It was really hard for me to get around my community unless I had access to a car. When I\u2019d visit New York, it was a whole new world.I went to school to study how cities are built through architecture and urban planning. One of my first jobs out of school, I ended up working for Zipcar as a user experience designer, where I saw how challenging it was for companies to work with cities. There were some cities that welcomed Zipcar, and others that made things impossible. That piqued my interest in the intersection of cities, design, and technology. Then I learned about Code for America, which completely changed my trajectory. It helped me realize the huge potential for impact when you work at the city level.Team members arrive at the office by bike and skateboard, as well as bus and train, of course.The team gathers at the office\u2019s large picnic tables for lunch.Danny, what about you? What interested you about transportation planning?Danny: I grew up in the suburbs too, in Phoenix, which also meant limited access to public transportation. At college in Ithaca, New York, I relied on transit every day for my commute.After school, I started my career in software engineering, working for a startup on their backend API\u2019s. I learned a lot, but I knew I wanted to work on something a bit more meaningful. I had been interested in this idea of open data, where governments publish their data proactively rather than waiting for public records requests. The potential benefits of that were exciting to me, in particular, what cities could do with municipal-level data.Tiffany: Yeah, I recently heard the Mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, say that local government is the most actionable level of government.\u201cCity governments are large enough to impact a lot of people, but the people making the decision are truly part of the community.\u201d \u2014 DanDan: Cities are a really powerful level of government to work with. They are large enough to impact a lot of people, but the people making the decisions are truly part of the community \u2014 they care deeply about solving the problems they see around them.Danny: Exactly. So that led me to Code for America. I was excited by the idea that I could be inside local government and see how it operates. I got interested in transit specifically because, in a lot of ways, it\u2019s leading the pack with open data. Making data available to be pushed to mobile apps helps increase ridership, which has led to things like the general transit feed specification. I saw it as a virtuous cycle full of rich problems to work on.Believe it or not, I first recognized the potential of open data through my interest in baseball statistics. There was this nonprofit organization, Retrosheet, that published pitch-by-pitch historical data of every Major League Baseball game for the past 100 years. The organization had a really strong governance model, and this community built up around it. That enabled a wave of statisticians to come in and explore the sport in a way people hadn\u2019t before. I think you can apply that same idea to public transit \u2014 you can dig into this data and learn so much.Above right: When Remix team members attended an art show hosted by Creativity Explored, a local non-profit supporting artists with developmental disabilities, they (of course) gravitated to this sculpture of the 49 bus. The artist, who they met, said he feels \u201clike the bus\u2019 protector\u201d when he rides it.Above right: JP\u2019s desk sports a gold-plated bus, Remix\u2019s MVP trophy for going above and beyond to help a customer.Sam: I never wanted to work for a startup. I read Hacker News and thought startups were mostly mean people yelling at each other. So I went directly to government. I joined this top-secret lab in the middle of the desert doing the coolest work I can never talk about again. And I would have stayed there, but I didn\u2019t love living in the desert. So after about a year, I moved out to San Francisco and joined NASA. My biggest project was designing an iPad app for astronauts onboard the space station. Before that they were using old ThinkPads running Internet Explorer 6. Seriously.As cool as that was, I felt like my impact was limited. There were only six astronauts on the space station, and two were Russian and didn\u2019t use anything the U.S. designed. I knew government was filled with big, interesting problems, so I joined Code for America and met these folks.How did you go from \u201cnever wanting to work at a startup\u201d to starting one?Tiffany: I personally had two criteria for what I wanted to do: number one was to work with people I really liked, and number two was to work on a problem I really cared about. I was agnostic to the format. When we stumbled upon Remix and got something like 250 emails saying this was a dream come true for so many people, we knew the demand was there. We even had a paying customer before we incorporated. I just wanted to continue working on it, to see how far it would go.\u201cWe knew the demand was there. We even had a paying customer before we incorporated.\u201d \u2013TiffanyDanny: We did consider starting a nonprofit instead.Tiffany: Yeah, but talking to people who run nonprofits, we realized a significant portion of the organization is dedicated to fundraising, often from unsustainable sources. When we thought about all the resources that would go towards fundraising, we realized there wouldn\u2019t be much left to devote to making an impact.These chairs were \u201cthe only quiet place to take a call\u201d in the company\u2019s first (much smaller) office.Left: John (CMO) helps collate mailers destined for city planners\u2019 mailboxes. Right: Transit tickets from around the world.Shhh, Wes is thinking.Aside from paying customers, are there other things that make Remix different from the average startup?Danny: Having city planners as our primary users. They are solving long-term quality-of-life problems for millions of people.Sam: Planners are the nicest people. No one joins the planning profession for the fame or fortune. You do it because you care about the community you live in. Probably the coolest thing about this company is being able to talk to those types of folks every day.Tiffany: We also learned how much pent-up demand there was for this stuff. Of course, there are challenges and constraints associated with partnering with governments. But unlike a lot of government contractors who seem to be primarily self-interested, we come from a place of deep empathy and genuinely wanting to help them provide strong public services for their city.Dan: We were coming from zero government sales background \u2014 or any sales background \u2014 and are now working with 200 cities. I think that\u2019s proof in itself.\u201cWe were coming from zero government sales background and are now working with 200 cities.\u201d \u2013DanTell us more about the product and some of the technical issues you\u2019re working through.Dan: One of the features I built early on was Jane. You can place Jane on a transit system map and see how far she would be able to get in 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes. Until that, everything was just a line on a map, which doesn\u2019t tell you anything if the bus only comes every three hours. We heard from a lot of cities that Jane made it easy to explain the impact of changes to their transit systems.One of the coolest things has been hearing that Jarrett Walker uses Jane. He\u2019s an author who writes about human transit and has served as a huge inspiration for us. He actually came and did a transit workshop for us last month where he explained how he\u2019s used Jane in cities all over the world to make a case for a major network redesigns.Danny: Another core part of the product is being able to provide value to a customer on day one, rather than requiring an arduous integration process. By building on top of open data, like OpenStreetMap and GTFS, it just works \u2014 anywhere in the world.Transit is full of really interesting algorithmic problems, and there\u2019s tons of peer-reviewed research on transit systems and how they work. Everything from the operational side and optimization of the buses to service design and the interactions people have when they\u2019re riding.Above right: JP shows of his \u201cJane\u201d shirt, highlighting one of Remix\u2019s popular features, allowing planners to understand how changes will affect transit times.What are the biggest challenges Remix is facing as you look to the future?Sam: One reason we were able to have a fast impact in transit is because it\u2019s supported by lots of publicly available, standardized data. As we start to move into other city departments, that\u2019s bound to decrease. The truth is, the government has this huge wealth of data, and a lot of it is not in great shape. We are already addressing that problem with an offshore team that cleans up a lot of transit data. As our reach widens, the scope of that work will increase.What about autonomous vehicles? Is public transport even going to exist in the future?Tiffany: No question \u2014 of course it will. There is a limited amount of space on our streets, so as populations continue to grow, we will need to figure out how to get the most people to the most places in the least amount of space. As Jarrett Walker puts it, it\u2019s an issue of geometry. From that perspective, vehicles for mass transit will always be important \u2014 whether there\u2019s a person driving them or a computer.Interested in joining the team?

For others, it would be revolutionary, requiring faculty to fundamentally rethink their entire curricula and delivery systems, their professional networks, and their core obligations to their students.\u201d (original)Accreditation\u201c[A] new and more focused accreditation process would provide substantive review of the extent to which [the j-schools are] meeting their goals. Like the current process, such a system would involve peer reviewers; unlike the more traditionally academic process, however, a professional accreditation process would engage a team of highly qualified digital-first journalists to help review a program\u2019s curriculum, assess its currency, measure its outcomes and confirm its quality.\u201d (original)\u201cOf the nine standards of accreditation, eight focus on institutional structures, processes, and systems. Only Standard 2 centers on the quality of a program\u2019s curriculum and instruction, and of the 12 relevant metrics, only one refers to technology and \u2018the digital world\u2019 \u2026 there is no mention of job placement, employer satisfaction data, or external professional assessment of new graduates\u2019 skills or competencies.\u201d (original)A thought: Both my undergraduate institution (Penn State) and my grad school (The New School for Social Research) send me frequent postal mail and even call me on the phone (although I beg them to stop) asking for donations. In other words, they know where I am and how to reach me. Given that, why don\u2019t more j-schools poll their graduates regularly? Why don\u2019t all j-schools have reliable systems for tallying and reporting on the careers of their alumni? We\u2019ve got social scientists on our faculties \u2014 they understand the value of longitudinal studies and survey research.Why don\u2019t we eat our own dog food?If the j-schools are failing their graduates, surely this is the way to find out and raise the stakes for meaningful change.Recommendations for j-schools\u201cThe following three recommendations offer a practical, effective option for schools dedicated to preparing the next generation of digital-first journalists:\u201cEstablish a digital-first academic startup, the educational equivalent of the ProPublicas, FiveThirtyEights and Vox Medias of the news-and-information marketplace.\u201cLeverage the disciplinary expertise of the full-time faculty while creating new delivery structures for skills-based learning.\u201cCreate a mission-specific accreditation process for programs that define as their core mission the preparation of 21st-century journalists.\u201d (original)Note: You can find these recommendations and full explanations of each one about two-thirds of the way down the fifth section of the report. Under point 2 (about three-fourths down the page), you\u2019ll find a bullet list of concrete suggestions, such as:\u201cA digital-first journalism school would \u2026 [be] re-created every semester through active engagement with professionals, incubators, accelerators and faculty to design boot camps, lectures, seminars, workshops, field trips, and self-taught tutorials designed exclusively to meet the learning needs of students now.\u201dSarah Bartlett, dean of the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism, suggests that \u201cthe demands of preparing students for a newly dynamic media environment may require a reconsideration of the classic professional-scholarly debate: What is the mission and purpose of professional journalism education?\u201d (original)\u201cAnd does achieving that mission in a digital age require systems and structures different from those of the more theoretical schools imagined\u201d in this 2013 paper by three journalism academics? (Note: That\u2019s a PDF, 77 pages.)See also: Rewriting J-School, by Jon Marcus (Spring 2014)Skills\u201cWe all know that the greatest need right now is people in the world of journalism who are not innumerate. And we know when you train people in those fields, they will have jobs.\u201d \u2014 Stephen Engelberg, editor-in-chief and co-CEO, ProPublica\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like saying that to be a successful bus driver you have to be the mechanic. You don\u2019t need to be the mechanic. Or that to be a successful pilot you have to be able to build the plane. You don\u2019t need to know how to build the plane.\u201d \u2014 Marty Baron (original)I\u2019m not fond of Baron\u2019s analogies. If you want to choreograph the ballet, you have to know how to dance. If you dance Swan Lake, you have to be able to put on your own damned pointe shoes. Rembrandt had to learn how to mix colors. Mozart knew how to play the harpsichord.Journalists who work with code are not building computers. They are building digital stories. (This is me on my soapbox.)Tools are tools. If you can\u2019t use the tools, then you can\u2019t make things.\u201cWhile everybody agrees that journalists need to have technical skills and understandings, there is much less consensus about the depth or level of tech mastery necessary for success.\u201d (original)On ridiculous job ads: \u201cI think possibly the hiring managers don\u2019t know what skills you need, so they list everything.\u201d \u2014 Lindsey Cook, data reporter, U.S. News & World Report (original)Others say \u201cworking journalists need to understand and use digital tools for data analysis and visualization, for example, but they don\u2019t have to be experts or engineers.\u201d (original)\u201cEven the newsrooms that say they want tech-savvy journalists who know how to code don\u2019t understand the difference between necessary skills and unnecessary mastery, says Lindsey Cook [data reporter, U.S. News & World Report].\u201d (original)\u201cAll newsrooms are looking for journalists who actively generate new ideas and opportunities that can help move the organization forward, he [Marty Baron] says.\u201d\u201cOn the far end of the tech-essential spectrum are journalism nonprofits such as the Center for Public Integrity, the Center for Investigative Reporting and ProPublica, and for-profits like Narrative Science, which define journalism in data-centric terms.\u201d (original)\u201cWe need more great writers, we need more great number crunchers, and we need more people who can visually display it on the Web in a way that\u2019s compelling.\u201d \u2014 Paul Steiger, founding CEO and executive chairman, ProPublica (original)\u201cNow you\u2019re being judged on metrics like community engagement, time on site, time on section, time on story, how much are you seeding and engaged in conversation. \u2026 If your social media doesn\u2019t sing and doesn\u2019t get response, you\u2019re going to be marked down for that.\u201d \u2014 Marcia Parker, former assistant dean of the University of California Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism (original)\u201c[T]here\u2019s user engagement, communicating with your audience, using social media to expand and extend your audience. \u2026 It\u2019s really about seeding conversation, engaging in conversation, keeping a conversation going \u2014 not just because you have to improve time on your site, but because users are now in the habit of really engaging with stories.\u201d \u2014 Marcia Parker (original)Journalism\u201cWe have to restore some of the conversation about why journalism and accountability matters, why we should think about journalism as an activity instead of an industry.\u201d \u2014 Jeffrey Rutenbeck, dean of the School of Communication at American University (original)\u201cWe used to just do the journalism, and the business side will be taken care of. \u2026 That was false security for us because we thought people were coming to us for certain reasons, but they were in fact coming because they didn\u2019t have other choices. Now they have other options, and we are getting a better sense of the real world. That may lead to a situation in which journalists only do the things that make money, and then what happens to the stuff that doesn\u2019t make money?\u201d \u2014 Marty Baron (original)\u201c[J]ournalism remains essential to an informed, effective, and sustainable democracy.\u201d (original)\u201cA free press is crucial as a watchdog in keeping [the balance between national security and civil liberties] in check, in keeping government in check and the public informed. It\u2019s crucial that we have a free press and an informed public, so they understand the role journalists play in maintaining our freedoms.\u201d \u2014 James Duff, former CEO of the Freedom Forum and the Newseum (original)Five pillarsOne person interviewed said journalism organizations should focus on these, and make them priorities. I found these very interesting, but they were only mentioned in the report, not expanded upon.\u201cEngagement design (the art and science of why anyone should pay attention to journalism in the first place);\u201cManagement of complex systems and processes in an environment that is increasingly networked;\u201cAnalytics and the measurement of impact;\u201cTransformative storytelling; and\u201cLeadership and accountability.\u201d\u2014 Jeffrey Rutenbeck, dean of the School of Communication at American University (original)Conclusions of the reportDianne Lynch, author of the report, wrote: \u201cMy takeaway from six months of listening is that the common concerns of professionals and academics alike can, in large part, be attributed to the rigidity of an academic system inadequately designed to provide and support the flexibility, immersion, iteration and professional currency that are such necessary attributes of the professional preparation of 21st-century journalists.\u201d (original)\u201cImportantly, the proposal does not suggest particular curricula, beyond assuming a grounding in the core competencies of traditional journalism: writing, reporting, history, ethics and law. It is instead a model of innovative systems and structures, designed to be adaptable to the strengths, capacities and opportunities unique to every journalism program and its faculty.\u201d (original)My conclusionsI think a lot of people, myself included, hoped this report would offer more of a blueprint, road map, or outline of how to transform the j-school. Not \u201cwhat it should become\u201d but rather \u201chow to become that.\u201d I was disappointed that it did not. The recommendations are good, but what do they really come down to?Hiring journalism professionals to come in and hold workshops, etc., in all the new ways of doing journalism.Building an accelerator within, but separate from, the university system.Still teaching \u201cthe core competencies of traditional journalism: writing, reporting, history, ethics and law.\u201dChanging accreditation to focus more on the outcomes of a j-school than its internal systems and structures.\u201cSuch a digital-first school would define success in terms of its measurable contributions to and impact upon the profession it has reinvented itself to serve.\u201dI am very grateful to the Knight Foundation for all it has done for journalism education over the past 20 years, including providing a j-school faculty position for me. The university is a huge and entrenched institution, and it\u2019s a challenge to effect change from within or without. Nevertheless, J-schools have got to change. The conversation must continue, and what\u2019s more, action must be taken.

What has changed in this release?1. We switched encoding /decoding of input parameters, output parameters and events parameters in Remix to ethers.js.Before switching to ethers.js we were using etheremjs-abi. This caused some changes to what formats are accepted as function inputs in autogenerated UI part in Remix e.g. what formats are accepted as function inputs in autogenerated UI part in Remix:The type bytes now requires an hexadecimal stringThe type address now requires to be filled (not possible anymore to keep the field blank by mistake)Decoded events in logs are also displayed in a slightly different way2. Publishing to a gist now requires authenticationGist API has recently changed and it unfortunately requires users to be authenticated to be able to publish a gist.Under https://github.com/settings/tokens select Generate new token.Then check only Create gists checkbox and generate a new token.Then paste it in Remix (right panel/Settings tab) and click SaveNow you can use these Github icons (top left corner) and store your files as Github gists.3. UX improvement: TerminalWhile waiting for transaction to be mined, you can now follow the transaction on Etherscan.Details button was removed. To see additional information about a transaction, click on the caret to the left of the log to expand/collapse the details.4. UX improvement: Run tabWhen you have multiple parameters in a function, previously you had to put the parameters in a comma separated list. Now, if you click the caret to the right of the input field, each parameter gets its own input field. Scroll down to see example for addProposal function.5. PluginsWe are also working on improving how Remix can be used by and with external tools and applications. You will soon be able to create custom plugins and connect them to Remix in order to get extra features you might need (e.g. linting, static analysis, transaction analysis, testing).A first Plugin API will likely be released within two months.Currently the plugin feature is in the test phase (first stable version of plugin API is expected in the next two months). If you are interested in plugins and would like to try out our alpha API, please reach out to us in the https://gitter.im/ethereum/remix-dev-plugin.We have also released embark-remix which allows users to spawn an instance of Remix IDE on their local computer and interact with their Embark project.

Se voc\u00ea tiver o app do Google Drive no seu iPhone ou Android e tentar abrir uma planilha ou documento de texto, vai se deparar com uma tela semelhante a esta:A partir de certo momento, todas as fun\u00e7\u00f5es de cria\u00e7\u00e3o e edi\u00e7\u00e3o de documentos, que antes eram realizadas no app principal, o Google Drive, foram separadas e migraram para apps separados \u2014 os chamados standalone apps.Outro que passou recentemente pelo mesmo processo foi o Foursquare, que permitia encontrar lugares bacanas e fazer check-in. Agora, para fazer as duas coisas, voc\u00ea precisa de dois apps distintos: o Foursquare e o Swarm, respectivamente.Nova tela de venue no Foursquare, com a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o do lugar, o endere\u00e7o, as dicas. Ao clicar em Check-in, voc\u00ea \u00e9 levado para o Swarm (ou para a tela de download do novo app).E n\u00e3o termina por a\u00ed. Num longo processo de mudan\u00e7a que est\u00e1 chegando agora \u00e0 fase final, o app do Facebook tamb\u00e9m foi fatiado: cortaram o bate-papo do aplicativo principal e criaram o Facebook Messenger, app \u00e0 parte que funciona integrado ao principal.Por que todos esses servi\u00e7os est\u00e3o fazendo isso? O que est\u00e1 por tr\u00e1s dessa tend\u00eancia? Existe algo de comum ligando essas iniciativas ou ser\u00e1 mera coincid\u00eancia?Pol\u00eamicas \u00e0 parte (o Facebook foi acusado de violar a privacidade dos usu\u00e1rios com o novo app, o que foi desmentido por ve\u00edculos como o Mashable e pelo pr\u00f3prio Facebook, que criou uma p\u00e1gina oficial explicando tudo), vamos encontrar a explica\u00e7\u00e3o para a mudan\u00e7a, como era de se esperar, nos interesses comerciais de cada empresa. Qual o caminho mais seguro para gerar receita e aumentar o faturamento?No caso do Facebook, a empresa percebeu que as pessoas demoram muito para responder os amigos quando est\u00e3o usando o chat do Facebook no celular, dando prioridade a outros apps de bate-papo, como o Whatsapp. At\u00e9 mesmo no Facebook Messenger elas s\u00e3o 20% mais r\u00e1pidas para responder do que quando est\u00e3o no app principal.Isso estava prejudicando o Facebook, j\u00e1 que os apps de bate-papo concorrentes estavam afastando as pessoas da rede e, por consequ\u00eancia, comprometendo os neg\u00f3cios que tiram proveito justamente dos dados do bate-papo. Com o app de chat separado, uma parte dos \u201cdesertores\u201d volta a conversar pela rede do Facebook. Problema (at\u00e9 certo ponto) resolvido. Resta saber se o Facebook Messenger crescer\u00e1 o suficiente no m\u00e9dio e longo prazo.Tela de configura\u00e7\u00f5es do Facebook Messenger, com o aviso no topo: \u201cToque para retornar ao Facebook\u201d.Os casos do Foursquare e do Google Drive n\u00e3o s\u00e3o muito diferentes. O que est\u00e1 por tr\u00e1s dessa tend\u00eancia de desmembramento \u00e9 a mudan\u00e7a de comportamento trazida pela evolu\u00e7\u00e3o do cen\u00e1rio mobile: antes, as startups competiam para segurar o usu\u00e1rio na tela do aplicativo, interagindo com ele o m\u00e1ximo de tempo poss\u00edvel. Isso significava que um \u00fanico app tinha de dar conta de todos os recados a que tinha se proposto.Hoje, os usu\u00e1rios ficaram t\u00e3o \u00e0 vontade com a crescente oferta de apps mobile, e encontram com tanta facilidade em outros lugares o que lhes interessa, que deixou de ser interessante concentrar tudo num s\u00f3 lugar: o mais importante \u00e9 identificar o foco de interesse principal e oferecer \u00e0s pessoas a melhor experi\u00eancia poss\u00edvel dentro dele. Se uma parte das pessoas quer encontrar amigos nas redondezas e a outra quer encontrar um lugar bacana pra comer algo, oferecer as duas coisas no mesmo app aumenta o risco de que servi\u00e7os concorrentes, mais especializados ou atraentes nessa ou naquela fun\u00e7\u00e3o, acabem roubando a clientela.O que voc\u00ea faz? Cria voc\u00ea mesmo a alternativa mais especializada: os interessados em encontrar lugares ficam com o Foursquare, e os interessados em encontrar pessoas migram para o Swarm. Quem quiser as duas coisas mant\u00e9m os dois, e todos ficam felizes. A mesma coisa para quem s\u00f3 trabalha com o Word, e nunca com planilhas, ou vice-versa: quem s\u00f3 trabalha com n\u00fameros e n\u00e3o precisa de um editor de texto. App de planilha para um, app de texto para o outro, ou os dois apps no mesmo celular para quem precisa de ambos.Ao que tudo indica, essa tend\u00eancia deve continuar, pelo menos nos apps mais importantes, que atendem um n\u00famero maior de usu\u00e1rios e oferecem uma gama relativamente ampla de funcionalidades. A palavra de ordem hoje parece ser especializa\u00e7\u00e3o, ou foco. Quem se arrisca a prever onde isso vai parar? Qual ser\u00e1 a pr\u00f3xima etapa da evolu\u00e7\u00e3o mobile?

Como muitas das pessoas, eu estava utilizando o iPhone como alarme, mas isso tem suas consequ\u00eancias. Com um iPhone, voc\u00ea tem que ser muito disciplinado para n\u00e3o come\u00e7ar a olhar suas mensagens no Whatsapp ou SMSs no exato momento que acorda, mesmo se desabilitar todas as notifica\u00e7\u00f5es.

Mas, na verdade, o tempo entre acordar e come\u00e7ar o dia \u00e9 muito especial, um tempo em que o inconsciente da sua mente est\u00e1 se transitando para o consciente. N\u00f3s lembramos parte de nossos sonhos, estamos em uma esp\u00e9cie de devaneio por alguns momentos. Enquanto a m\u00e1quina de caf\u00e9 est\u00e1 esquentando, n\u00f3s podemos refletir gentilmente sobre as coisas.

Eu me sinto encorajado por aplicativos como o Snapchat. Deletar mensagens e fotos apenas alguns segundos depois que elas forem vistas \u00e9 uma porrada em um mundo de timeline do Facebook e nossa obcess\u00e3o por arquivar tudo. O mundo digital pode disseminar alguns detalhes dolorosos sobre n\u00f3s muito rapidamente, mas isso tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 incr\u00edvelmente ef\u00eamero e n\u00f3s podemos usar isso ao nosso favor.

Qual \u00e9 a sua opini\u00e3o sobre este assunto? Existe um equil\u00edbrio?David Baker: Em 1988, eu escrevi um artigo sobre como, em alguns anos, todos n\u00f3s estar\u00edamos trabalhando de casa gra\u00e7as a uma incr\u00edvel tecnologia chamada fax. N\u00e3o existiria mais a necessidade de conviver com pessoas em trens lotados e \u00f4nibus para inflar escrit\u00f3rios em regimes quase escolares. Eu tamb\u00e9m disse que os escrit\u00f3rios remanescentes dispensariam o uso de papel. Bem, ao que parece, essas previs\u00f5es foram muito inocentes. Toda manh\u00e3, em cidades ao redor do mundo, \u00f4nibus e trens ainda s\u00e3o lotados na hora do rush e os escrit\u00f3rios est\u00e3o soterrados por papeis. Obviamente existe algo muito recompensador em ir ao trabalho.Mas eu acho que n\u00f3s dever\u00edamos dar uma segunda chance ao modelo de trabalhar em casa, mesmo que em parte da semana. Existe algo em sentar-se em seu pr\u00f3prio espa\u00e7o, pensando em seu pr\u00f3prio tempo sobre um problema que leva a maneiras muito mais criativas de fazer as coisas do que sentado em um escrit\u00f3rio barulhento com pol\u00edticas entre departamentos e reuni\u00f5es desnecess\u00e1rias. E em casa as coisas s\u00e3o feitas muito mais rapidamente.Mas para as pessoas trabalharem de casa mais do que elas trabalham no escrit\u00f3rio, algo fundamental deve mudar na maneira como vemos trabalho e especialmente como escolhemos gerentes. Gerentes normalmente s\u00e3o sofr\u00edveis no que fazem. Eles s\u00e3o promovidos por serem bons em algo e ent\u00e3o, bizarramente, eles s\u00e3o tirados do trabalho em que s\u00e3o \u00f3timos e obrigados a supervisionar, motivar, encontrar, recrutar e animar outras pessoas, um conjunto de habilidades totalmente diferente.

Outros est\u00e3o totalmente fora de sua \u00e1rea, como se tivessem pedido a um pescador para projetar uma televis\u00e3o.Eles s\u00e3o os principais inimigos do trabalho de casa, porque sua \u00fanica maneira de descobrir se a equipe est\u00e1 trabalhando bem \u00e9 contando as horas que ela est\u00e1 no escrit\u00f3rio. Vamos pensar novamente sobre as atribui\u00e7\u00f5es que n\u00f3s queremos para nossos gerentes e incluir a elas a habilidade de julgar as pessoas pelo que elas produzem e n\u00e3o as horas que eles trabalham.A\u00ed o trabalho em casa ir\u00e1 se tornar mainstream, os gerentes v\u00e3o ter os \u00f4nibus e trens s\u00f3 para eles e o resto de n\u00f3s poder\u00e1 colocar o r\u00e1dio baixinho ao fundo, fazer o que precisa ser feito e empregar o restante do dia ao trabalho mais importante, o de viver.Remix: H\u00e1 muitas pessoas que vivem pensando em suas pr\u00f3ximas f\u00e9rias. Como fazer com que o aqui e agora sejam t\u00e3o recompensadores quanto a pr\u00f3xima viagem?David Baker: Bom, voc\u00ea pode entender a vontade deles de sonhar e muitas pessoas realmente est\u00e3o presas em vidas sem sentido, dentro e fora do trabalho. Mas eu n\u00e3o acho que n\u00f3s temos um papel passivo apenas aqui. N\u00f3s podemos mudar alguns, sen\u00e3o todos os aspectos da nossa vida at\u00e9 que radicalmente, e uma dica de como podemos visualizar isso, m\u00f3rbida at\u00e9, \u00e9 imaginar os \u00faltimos minutos antes de nossa morte. Se formos atropelados por um carro amanh\u00e3, deus nos proteja, em nossos \u00faltimos minutos na terra, poder\u00edamos dizer que estav\u00e1mos vivendo a vida que gostar\u00edamos de viver? E se n\u00e3o, por que n\u00e3o? N\u00f3s vamos nos tornar uma daquelas pessoas que est\u00e3o sempre ensaiando fazer algo? Quando crian\u00e7as, n\u00f3s sonhamos com a nossa vida quando adultos e \u00e9 um choque descobrir que a vida adulta n\u00e3o \u00e9 exatamente como a gente imaginava. Mas isso n\u00e3o significa que n\u00f3s dever\u00edamos parar de sonhar em como nossa vida poderia ser melhor \u2014 n\u00e3o pelos olhos dos outros, mas pelos nossos pr\u00f3prios olhos. Viver a vida que queremos viver n\u00e3o \u00e9 f\u00e1cil e muitas vezes n\u00e3o \u00e9 pr\u00e1tico. Mas viver partes de nossas vidas de uma maneira mais honesta com o que realmente queremos l\u00e1 no fundo vai fazer com que todo dia seja recompensador (e at\u00e9 mais recompensador) que as f\u00e9rias.Remix: Um dos conceitos da The School of Life \u00e9 que para encontrar a felicidade, n\u00f3s devemos desconstruir para depois reconstruir. Como fazer isso dar certo quando h\u00e1 outros fatores envolvidos como pessoas, trabalho, etc?David Baker: Eu acho que n\u00f3s devemos ser um pouco ego\u00edstas e mudar numa dire\u00e7\u00e3o que \u00e9 mais correta para gente. E isso pode levar a algumas perdas como um sal\u00e1rio mais baixo, menos feriados, vender o carro ou viver em uma casa menor. Mas todas essas coisas s\u00e3o externas (e existem milh\u00f5es de pessoas, mesmo no Brasil que ganham e gastam menos que a gente e que tem uma vida mais feliz). A recompensa ser\u00e1 a habilidade de escutar mais claramente o que de fato queremos, o tipo de trabalho que queremos fazer, o tipo de pessoas com quem queremos passar mais tempo com, as atividades que n\u00f3s proporcionam a maravilhosa sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de fluidez.

Midas, our weekly sponsor, is gamifying finance and investing. Create your own asset mix, team up or compete with others, and work your way up to the top.Today, we\u2019re going to catch up with Philipp Do\u011fan, Co-founder and Head Of Strategy at Midas (pictured, left), to discuss the ups and downs of technical development in the crypto space, why they cancelled their ICO in favor of a Melon token mining event, and how they see crypto investments fitting into the increasing demand for impact investing infrastructures.David Smooke: What is Midas? And why does the world need it?Philipp Do\u011fan: We give users investment funds on their phones, hosted on Ethereum. Our mission is to provide access to a decentralized financial infrastructure to empower the user. Midas is about low-barrier access to crypto assets and connects the user\u2019s asset mixes with information market platforms like Gnosis, charity platforms and other decentralized services. People have the chance to take control of financial instruments and combine them in creative ways for the first time. Given the social and environmental significance of your investment decisions, every asset mix on Midas can be turned into an impact investment fund.Money should no longer be defined by banks only. We provide the tools for our users to remix finance.Your FAQ page describes Midas as \u201ca decentralized portfolio management system on the Melon protocol. Every user manages a technology-regulated investment fund (mix) on the blockchain that can hold any thinkable crypto asset: cryptocurrencies or utility tokens, as well as tokenized analog assets like stocks, real estate or art.\u201d What type of crypto assets will drive early product usage?Our main focus is on assets that casual users can relate to. Financial products like bonds or ETFs don\u2019t mean nothing to most people. That is why we integrate assets like prediction markets or crypto collectibles.Last year, Cryptokitties has shown the power of collectibles in terms of onboarding and engaging users. We will start out with the existing ERC20 tokens that are traded on the exchanges integrated in the Melon Protocol. Information market outcome tokens as well as the first collectibles will follow. In the future we want to expand the selection to other chains enabled by technology like Polkadot.Midas recently cancelled a private and public token sale and is going to do a Token Minting Event to the Melon community. In the short and long term, how is this going to make your company more money? And why was it the right strategic choice?I love that we took the decision to cancel our ICO and commit 100% on the Melon protocol TME proposal. The governance feature the Melon team presented makes the protocol truly decentralized in the long run and guarantees its maintenance and further development by its stakeholders. Projects building on Melon can ask the Melon community for funding through minting new MLN or merge an already existing token with MLN. By reducing the amount of different tokens, we erase friction between projects, reducing entry barriers and makes MLN the token for the asset management industry.Teams uniting behind the Melon protocol and supporting each other will strengthen the protocol\u2019s resilience given the huge incentives in play, since it is the technology we all build on.Your one pager identifies your target market as \u201cMillennials, aunties, investor noobies & professionals: hundreds of millions of retail investors and almost 2.5 bn. social media users all around the globe.\u201d What is the high level strategy for user acquisition of the Midas network?Users have the opportunity to monetize their crypto investing skills. We have a rewards pool for the best performing mixes on our platform. If you are good at this you can fundamentally change your life. We also reward users for onboarding their friends, plus we work on integrating popular wallets to increase early adoption.Your one pager also points to monetization as competition fees and promoted content. What existing businesses and businesses models do you look at as inspiration for Midas\u2019 monetization strategy?We decided to get rid of any transaction fees except gas. What we do is we take fees for 1vs1 challenges between users. Users can compete with their asset mixes, rise through the ranks and increase their exposure to the rewards pool. We take a cut of those fees, the rest goes straight into the pool. In the future we plan to expand on that model by adding promoted content, which is a bit tricky because we want to provide useful content to the users and not spam them with random ads.Let\u2019s talk about the name \u201cMidas.\u201d Everything King Midas touched (apparently) turned to Gold. Why are you called Midas? And how did the name come about?King Midas represents exactly this: generating profits is great, but if you get greedy you can destroy everything around you. On our platform you can connect your asset mix with a charity or NGO of your choice. Blockchain enables services where you can transparently track every step of a donation. Combining this with micro profits of retail funds, we get a new style and scope of earning streams for those organizations and really push good causes harder then ever before.How do you plan to gamify interest in the investment choices of the leaders in your community?Investing in top ranked asset mixes increases your chances of upgrading the performance of your own asset mix. This increases your chance of winning battles against other users and to gain higher exposure to the rewards pool.Picking mixes and assets to build your own mix is like collecting pokemon, each has its own performance indicator, strengths and weaknesses. You try different combinations and twist your mix until you get an edge over the competition with your own unique style.The concept paper reads, \u201cMidas\u2019 key function is the Midas Touch. With the Midas Touch users can buy crypto assets or invest in other users\u2019 asset mixes. It is as easy to use as a \u201clike\u201d button, but for investments.\u201d The like button for investments is a clever idea, but the like button is a pretty low barrier to digital social engagement. Are you picturing a median investment of what USD level? And how else do you flush out this comparison?Actually you have to go through two additional screens after tapping on Midas Touch: set the amount and confirm. We are dealing with money after all. Users can skip the \u201cset the amount\u201d part though by setting a default value for their investments so they only need to confirm one time after tapping.The beta version is scheduled to be released in the first half of 2019. Could you give us a rundown on the techstack, the product\u2019s progress to date, and what will be the biggest technical hurdles over the next year?We started the back-end development one year ago and are in the middle of the front-end development right now. We just recently published eazyX, an interface to a decentralized exchange based on dutch auctions and we got some valuable insights out of this UX research project. On the blockchain side we build on the Melon protocol, the Gnosis information markets platform and decentralized exchanges like the DutchX.A big challenge is to combine the blockchain back-ends with our centralized service layer which is build around microservices mostly written in Scala and Haskell. We feel this combination is necessary to enhance the blockchain services and to create a snappy and crisp user experience. Another big challenge is finding the right balance between usability and transparency. It is all about UX in the end.Could you tell us about the team?The core team members know each other for quite a while already. Apart from a diverse skill set, most important to us was that new team members would fit on a social level. We love free minds and we like to give a lot of freedom. The team is currently distributed over the entire planet with people in Germany, Switzerland, Portugal, Argentina, India and Australia.What\u2019s the best way to stay up to date Midas\u2019 progress?

Image: NASA/Barry Wilmore.The Bright Future of CitiesAnyone who\u2019s ever been in an elementary school classroom will know the image. Earth at night from space. City lights glow against the dark backdrop of the continents, illuminating humanity\u2019s mark on an otherwise quiet planet.Chances are that since the last time you saw one of these images, the glowing spots have grown even wider and brighter. Today, more than half of the world\u2019s population lives in urbanized areas, and by 2030, two-thirds of the world\u2019s economic activity will come from cities. All trends point in one clear direction: the future will take place in cities.The Failing State of City InfrastructureYet zooming into the cities themselves, there\u2019s a much different story playing out. City infrastructure is falling behind. The American Society of Civil Engineers recently gave America\u2019s infrastructure a D+, with some individual cities faring much worse. Public transit in particular is showing the symptoms of overdue maintenance and chronic underinvestment. Despite this, policymakers have cited the convenience of Lyft and Uber, as well as the promise of autonomous vehicles, as reasons to target transit for budget cuts. Of course, smaller budgets will only perpetuate these problems.No amount of convenience from Uber or autonomous vehicles will change the basic geometry of cities.But transit isn\u2019t going anywhere. It can\u2019t. Mobility is a means for individuals to access better jobs, improve their lives, and even escape poverty. And no amount of convenience from Uber or autonomous vehicles will change the basic geometry of cities. In ever-denser urban areas, space has become a precious commodity, and vehicles that carry one person at a time simply take up too much street.So if public transit is necessary for healthy, productive cities, why is it falling so far behind?Transit Agencies Are Underfunded and Short-StaffedFor one, transit is chronically underfunded. The Highway Trust Fund \u2014 the federal account that bankrolls transit agencies \u2014 has been bankrupt for nearly a decade. It collects its money from a gasoline tax passed in 1993, and 24 years of inflation have diluted much of its purchasing power. Advances in fuel efficiency will only further chip away at gas tax revenues in the future.An empty piggy-bank for transit means perpetually short-staffed transit agencies. Planners juggle everything from grant applications for capital projects to bus detours during special events. At smaller agencies, planning staff even install the signs at bus stops.Planners often resort to drawing out concepts on large paper maps \u2014 even at America\u2019s largest and most respected transit agencies.When planners do find time to think about their transit service, they have to rely on a slew of outdated planning tools. GIS, long considered the gold standard for transit mapping, hasn\u2019t changed significantly since 1999. And because these tools require years of software-specific training, planners often resort to drawing out concepts on large paper maps \u2014 even at America\u2019s largest and most respected transit agencies. It can take weeks to work through a single idea.With these conditions, it\u2019s no wonder America\u2019s transit systems have stagnated for years. Recent studies link stagnant transit systems to declining ridership, which only perpetuates the virtuous cycle of further defunding and ridership woes.So what will save public transit?Building Livable Cities Through Better StorytellingThere\u2019s no shortage of data showing we need to improve public transit. But data isn\u2019t enough. It comes down to storytelling.Cognitive psychologist Jerome Bruner demonstrated that stories are 22 times more memorable than data. Armed with strong storytelling skills and planning principles, transit agencies can amplify this data to persuade people of public transit\u2019s value. They can persuade voters a half-cent sales tax would combat rush hour traffic; or persuade elected officials that prioritizing a bus lane over parking would benefit thousands of additional constituents; or persuade real estate developers that building near transit lines would create busier storefronts.Remix is working with over 200 cities in 10 countries to center their planning on best practices from the transit field.At Remix, we\u2019re helping governments build more livable cities by advancing strong storytelling and robust planning principles. As the first planning platform for public transit, we\u2019re working with over 200 cities in 10 countries to enable planners to sketch complex scenarios in seconds, make their decisions understandable, and center their planning on the best practices of the transit field.At Remix, we\u2019re helping governments build more livable cities by advancing strong storytelling and robust planning principles.We understand that convincing others of your data\u2019s relevance is just as important as the data itself. Now instead of sharing a 100-page transit development plan, planners can use a single isochrone map. In lieu of working for months in relative isolation, planners can explore scenarios in real time with the community. Or when building a 25-year transit plan, agencies can build consensus across their region in months not years.The Engine of Human InteractionsSo zooming back out to the satellite image of Earth, it\u2019s important to remember what the glowing dots represent. They\u2019re the lights of houses where people live and the businesses where people work. Cities are built on human interactions \u2014 and it\u2019s strong plans, good data, and compelling stories that will be the engine keeping these human interactions moving forward into the future.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Transportation", "Public Transit", "Remix", "Cities", "Smart Cities"]}, {"title": "Design at Remix: How Customer Empathy Helps Build Better Cities", "post_link": "https://medium.com/job-portraits/design-at-remix-how-customer-empathy-helps-build-better-cities-2be65317d32f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Job Portraits", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@JobPortraits", "publish_date": "2018-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-13", "readtime": "10.5", "claps": 188, "voters": 22, "content": "Design at Remix: How Customer Empathy Helps Build Better CitiesJob PortraitsFollowFeb 3, 2018 \u00b7 11 min readHow do you build a product that helps people fight for what\u2019s right? At Remix, the answer is an unwavering focus on customers and the communities they serve. We spoke with Tiffany Chu (co-founder and COO), Dory Little (Product Designer), Sam Hashemi (co-founder and CEO), and Jacob Zukerman (Product Designer) about how design thinking informed the founding of the company and how it drives collaboration, both within Remix and with customers. If you\u2019re interested in joining the team, view open roles or email Tammie Vu, tammie@remix.com.The Remix Design Team (left to right): Dory, Sam, Tiffany, and JacobFirst, give us your elevator pitch. What does Remix do?Tiffany: We help plan more livable cities. City planners use Remix to map and schedule transit routes, which allows them to do things like improve the lives of people in underserved communities. Historically, it\u2019s been tough for people who work in this space to advocate for what they think is right, because there weren\u2019t good tools to visually explain the impact of planning decisions. Remix makes pushing for those changes much easier.What\u2019s your role on the team, and what were you doing before Remix?Jacob: I\u2019m a designer, and this is day two at Remix for me! I spent the last five years at Google leading consumer products at Google Play and YouTube. Here, I\u2019m working on building the new Remix Streets product to design city streets. I\u2019m excited about the move because Remix was design-led from the beginning, so it has a lot of the richness you\u2019d find in popular consumer products, but in a tool for governments. The problems we solve are unique from ones I\u2019ve worked on in the past, and solving them makes a concrete, positive impact.Dory: I\u2019ve been at Remix more than a year now, and I also came from Google. I worked on a number of different products there \u2014 Google Search, Google Maps, and tools for small business owners. Here, I\u2019ve worked on our planning products, and right now I\u2019m focused on our scheduling product.Remix is the first company I\u2019ve worked for where the user base is overwhelmingly positive about what we do. That\u2019s not to say we build perfect products. But at Google, if we made a slight change to the compose button in Gmail, people would freak out. Here, we\u2019re working on a set of problems that had been ignored for so long our customers see clearly how we can help them.Dory and Loren sketching during design critique.Nichole, Sam, Tiffany, and Vincent rather enjoy budget meetings, thank you.Tiffany: I\u2019m the COO and a co-founder. I studied architecture and urban planning, ended up in design, and worked at Zipcar as their first UX hire. From there, I wanted to combine my experience with my interest in policy and local government, so I went to Code for America. That\u2019s where I met the rest of the founders.Since we started Remix three years ago, I\u2019ve focused on external-facing work, and have gotten to know our customers really well. I think about what our brand stands for, and how we communicate visually to our customers.Sam: I\u2019m a co-founder and CEO. I also come from a product design background, and have worked mostly in government. My first job was in this top-secret lab doing work I can\u2019t talk about. After that I designed software for astronauts on the space station for NASA before going to Code for America. These days, I spend a lot of my time hiring designers who are better than me, though I love getting into product and design discussions when I can.What role did design play in the early days of Remix?Tiffany: User experience was a core part of Remix from the beginning, because that\u2019s how the whole company started. We stumbled on a need we hadn\u2019t realized even existed. It was a side project at first \u2014 we were all living in San Francisco, and we designed a prototype to suggest better routes for Muni, one of the city\u2019s public transportation systems. It ended up going viral. Planners from all over the country started emailing us, asking if they could use it for their real transportation projects.\u201cGood design is invisible. Our goal is to get out of our customers\u2019 way and let them do the work they need to do.\u201d \u2014 DorySam: Planners are deeply passionate about what they do, and they\u2019re always willing to share stories with anyone they meet. When we started to ask them about their local communities, we\u2019d end up talking for hours. That\u2019s how we hit on a lot of what you see in the Remix products today \u2014 through direct conversations. They\u2019d tell us, \u201cHere\u2019s how transit is planned right now. Here are the critical problems I face every day. Here\u2019s what the product needs to do.\u201dAmy is proud of her latest four-legged hire. Below: Spotted around the office.Dory: There\u2019s a major emphasis on empathy for the customer here, which I think traces back to the role design played in the founding of the company. Good design is invisible, whether your user is trying to post a selfie or schedule a transit system. Our goal is to get out of our customers\u2019 way and let them do the work they need to do. For example, the experience of actually drawing a route has informed the product from day one. Before Remix, that required a bunch of different tools. You might use an Excel model to figure out costs, then physically draw things out on graph paper. Drafting a complex route could take a week of work. Remix lets planners do the same thing in a matter of minutes.How does design inform the work of other teams at Remix?Sam: Because we were founded with a design ethos, it\u2019s part of our culture company-wide. Onboarding for every employee includes training on what it\u2019s like to work in local government \u2014 what drives our customers, and the problems they face. Every employee spends a week on-site with a customer to learn about them firsthand. Each team is looking at their work through the lens of design.We also invest in sharing what we learn from customers with the entire company, so that knowledge isn\u2019t siloed within Product or Design. Dory made a video while visiting a customer that\u2019s a great example.Dory: Yeah, that was in Rochester, Minnesota, on one of our first research trips for the scheduling product. We got to see every aspect of the process \u2014 we would get up early and watch the vehicles pull out of the depot at 4 a.m. It was actually really fun. When we were watching people use Remix, we just started shooting video. It was the best, easiest way to help our teammates get in the customer\u2019s mindset and empathize with them. Instead of coming back to the office and sharing a doc with four facts that make up the customer persona or something, we could show exactly what we saw. It allowed people to quickly understand, \u201cOh, okay. Here are the pain points. Here\u2019s how we should pivot to think about this problem.\u201dBen and Cara in troubleshoot mode.Jacob, Chris, and Michal swivel their chairs around for a quick chat.Andrew (left) dreams of a car-free future. David (right) is in the email forest, through the trees.There are also a lot of processes in place here that bring design into the conversation early on. We always want to make sure we\u2019re solving the right problems and framing them correctly. There\u2019s a ton of collaboration and communication between Product Engineering and Design on how we want our roadmap to take shape. It isn\u2019t divided into us delivering design and engineers writing code \u2014 we\u2019re all building one product.And as Sam said, everyone talks to customers. I think every single person at Remix could give you specific examples of something they\u2019ve learned directly from a customer, and how that shapes their work. That\u2019s unusual. In most companies, you have certain people whose job it is to talk to customers. Here, everyone has that empathy.Tiffany: Absolutely \u2014 whether we\u2019re planning a workshop or designing a feature, everything we do has the customer in mind. We encourage everyone to directly ask the planners what they\u2019re thinking about, not just guess. We want people to walk over to the SFMTA office or pick up the phone, show a planner what we\u2019re working on, and talk to them about what they think. That\u2019s how we validate that what\u2019s in our heads is what our customers really need.\u201cBecause we were founded with a design ethos, it\u2019s part of our culture company-wide.\u201d \u2014 SamIn that video Dory shot, for example, I remember there were two different departments in the customer\u2019s office, literally split by a locked door. One side couldn\u2019t get to the other. We immediately realized our product needed to transcend that barrier and be a common platform for the agency. It got us thinking about ways we could design the product in a more collaborative way.Jacob: As someone new to the team, it\u2019s also exciting to think about how design culture can grow and change over time. I joined in part because of the success Remix has had so far, but also because I see so many opportunities to impact Remix\u2019s future. We can work together to figure out new tools we want to use, new approaches to collaborating with other teams, and new ways we want to communicate with customers.Lunch is catered two days per week. Typically, the majority of the team eats together.Claudia, Tiffany, and Sam talk to early Remix advisor and customer Chris Pangilinan about his perspective on public transit.Tell us more about how you gather feedback from customers.Tiffany: We host conferences and workshops, but not every local government has the budget to travel. So we meet customers where they are. We recently hosted a regional workshop in Akron, Ohio, where we flew a team out to meet with maybe a dozen agencies from all over Ohio and western Pennsylvania. We did hands-on training, and folks from our Success team wrote down every single piece of feedback they heard. We make sure the Product team sees that information, evaluates it, and prioritizes accordingly.Whenever we go on-site, our customers show us their city. That experience is so important. Many Remix customers can point to a specific part of the product they helped create, because almost everything we build is the result of their feedback. When we\u2019re in the process of designing something new, we\u2019ll have interested cities take a look. That\u2019s how we get products to the next level and bring them to the rest of the community.Jacob: Even though Remix isn\u2019t explicitly a social community, it absolutely feels like a community product. Through the events and through the tool itself, we\u2019re able to bring some of these cities and their planning organizations closer together. The product becomes a vehicle for collaboration, not just between planners and their internal stakeholders, but also between planners in different cities.\u201cMany Remix customers can point to a specific part of the product they helped create, because almost everything we build is the result of their feedback.\u201d \u2014 TiffanyDory: I think our customers absolutely feel the difference between what we provide and other tools available to them. Historically, there\u2019s been a huge underinvestment in design in this space, but we come in with this very high expectation to build a polished, thoughtful experience. That\u2019s how we show this community we care about them.Dory (above), Tiffany (below left), and Sam (below right) go heads-down in the late afternoon.How does retaining a high bar for design ultimately impact your customers and their constituents?Dory: Working in the public sector, a lot of our customers struggle with resources, including time. Anything we can do to help them quickly express their ideas and get feedback has a huge impact on how they can serve their cities. That\u2019s motivating.One thing we push for in all our products is visual storytelling. A good example is Jane, which is a virtual passenger you place on a map to see exactly how far she could travel in a set period of time. A city planner can use that to give concrete examples of what freedom looks like for different people in different scenarios, which is powerful. In a complex environment like public transit, making problems transparent is a big step toward better communication.\u201cThis is why I joined Remix \u2014 the problems we\u2019re solving aren\u2019t easy.\u201d \u2014 JacobSam: The default way of looking at the app is through the eyes of Jane, and we spend a lot of time thinking about how the defaults we use influence the way people design public transit. That\u2019s part of how we set the bar. We also have a weekly meeting we call the \u201cJank Guard,\u201d which is exactly what it sounds like \u2014 it guards against jankiness in the product. We basically review features and say, \u201cHere are the things we could do better.\u201d The goal is to make sure the product doesn\u2019t just check a box, but is a truly great experience.Every Tuesday, the team gathers at the end of the day for a weekly all-hands to discuss company updates, share laughs, and welcome new teammates.Tiffany: We also build Remix through a social impact lens, and that carries a certain expectation for us and for our customers. We\u2019ve been fairly opinionated about how these public services should be designed. For example, the demographic layers in the product \u2014 income level, communities of color, and job density are all at the top. That tells users, \u201cThese are the most important variables to consider.\u201d In trainings and onboardings, that\u2019s also part of how we teach. It\u2019s not about what Remix thinks is the right way \u2014 it\u2019s about the best practices we\u2019ve learned from working with more than 250 transit agencies, and how that informs our design. We need to consider the communities we\u2019re planning for, and provide the tools to effectively visualize them.Jacob: This is another reason I joined Remix \u2014 the problems we\u2019re solving aren\u2019t easy. You\u2019re using big, complex data to create rich tools that communicate clearly to customers. That\u2019s exciting work. We get to define the landscape in this space and build a lot of things for the first time. To be one of the people who tackles those challenges \u2014 that\u2019s pretty cool.Interested in joining the Remix team?Check out open roles or reach out to Tammie Vu tammie@remix.com.Your moment of Zen", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Design", "City Planning", "Transportation", "Startup", "Growing Teams"]}, {"title": "Qual o limite do remix?", "post_link": "https://medium.com/neworder/qual-o-limite-do-remix-bb9e7ef5aa95?source=search_post", "author_name": "Matheus Moura", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@CTRL", "publish_date": "2015-09-15", "last_modified_date": "2017-07-11", "readtime": "3.00", "claps": 23, "voters": 23, "content": "Saving Private RyanQual o limite do remix?Nada se cria, tudo se recria.Matheus MouraFollowSep 15, 2015 \u00b7 4 min readOs debates sobre quest\u00f5es relativas a c\u00f3pias X refer\u00eancias s\u00e3o constantes na esfera dos design gr\u00e1fico.

Its logo was the black star of Africa in honour of Kwame Nkrumah (not a lot of people at Basho knew that, but hey IDGAF\u2026)PurposeThe purpose of this blog post is two-fold:to recycle our thoughts to the wider academic and practitioner field in order to stimulate new research and inform other practioners of valuable options to explorehelp me get a new job (gies a job! \u2014 Erlang/BEAM, distributed systems, remote)ScopeThe scope of this blog post is:statement of customer problem we were trying to solvebackground that informed the solutionthe working prototype (and its discontents)In part 2 I talk of:relationships to other workfruitful areas for researchThings pertaining to the collapse of Basho as a company will only be referred to as and when they illuminate the state of play in these field notes.Customer ProblemThe customer problem was the third disk in a Tower of Hanoi of problems.The first customer problem, to which Riak is the solution, is \u201cI want a database that is highly available and which will always accept writes and respond to reads with an answer\u201d.The problem on top of that is addressed by CRDTs: \u201cwe had a partition during write and Riak cannot resolve the customer intentions and has returned 2 (or more) values for me to choose between on a read\u201d.This customer problem is the problem of using CRDTs:Halp! mucho confused, lolsob \u2620\ufe0f\ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udd25\u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udca5\ud83e\udd40\ud83d\ude1c\ud83e\udd21\ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udd15Developers find CRDTs hard to understand and hard to reason about.The genesis of this approach to solving this problem came from a casual remark by Russell Brown, king o\u2019CRDTs: to wit \u201cmaps and sets are not really datatypes, but mechanisms for managing causality that ought to be migrated higher up into the database\u201d.Background ExperienceWhilst at Hypernumbers I had designed an innovative data query language (with the help of Phil Wadler of Haskell fame who was on our advisory board).It is a bit of a side story which you can read here but is important because it meant that I understood exactly how little of the SQL paradigm you need to be able to build an online bank \u2014 that confidence in making unlikely things fit the problem domain greatly encouraged me in my experiments at Basho.How does Time Series fit in?Well, little Johnny, lets you sit down with warm milk and a cookie and I will tell you tall tales of management at Basho.Product management function at Basho was very weak (and I want to emphasis this was a management failing, not the fault of people on the product team \u2014 people rarely fail, processes often fail \u2014 but at the top when management fail to put in place proper processes, for hiring, training, working, then those people, the C-suites, have failed hard. At Basho the heid-bummers failed hard, and often.)So the company jinked about seeking the magic product feature for Time Series (which an incoherent product process can never find) I, in my own quiet way, tried to hold the customer as we say in Scotland. I had spent 2 years working at bet365 as a consumer of Riak and tried to keep that view of the product alive.This story is that: the strategic view of an integrated query approach for the new TS system and the existing KV (Key-Value) Riak product.So lets talk about NoSQL/KV systems and their discontents.NoSQL and its discontentsYou can of course query a NoSQL system with SQL, its just that the only valid query statement is SELECT value from mytable WHERE key='mykey';In this section I will assume you know how a Dynamo DB ring works, and what an n_val is. If you don\u2019t here is a primer.Riak KV the basicsEssentially there are two access paths to reading data from a NoSQL dynamo style DB. If you know the key you can to directly to the data and read it:Key reads and writes go directly to where the data isBut if you don\u2019t know the key you need to scan the whole ring (or a sub-set of the ring \u2014 if you have written the data with an n-val of 3 you need to read 1/3 of the nodes + 1 to be sure of getting all the data:Non-key reads require you to scan the whole ringNormal KV databases are therefore a bit all-or-nothing \u2014 go to one bit of the ring or read it all.TS and data colocation on the ringAt the core of TS was the idea of introducing data co-location \u2014 make the data a little bit lumpier (with slightly more variation in distribution of work around the ring).It is the issue of data colocation that ties the Time Series query work with riak KV. TS colocates data by quantizing time, and KV colocates data by writing to CRDT sets.At the core of the dynamo model is the deterministing placing of data on a fixed and agreed \u2018ring\u2019 of data using consistent hashing.The user writes a key-value pair {key, value} and the key is hashed to get a vnode and the data is dispatched to that vnode to be written (with additional values being written to the next vnode in the ring, and the one after that if, for instance, an n_val of 3 is used.In normal KV the value of the key stuffed into the hashing function is the same as the key that is written to the disk. In TS we insist that the key that the customer supplies is a composite key (this isn\u2019t strictly true, but\u2026).A typical TS key has the form {id, time} giving a KV pair of {{id, time}, value}. In TS before we hash this key to write to the DB we quantize it. Essentially for a given bucket we specify a time period (10 seconds, 15 minutes, two weeks, a year). If you image a device ticking and sending a reading every minute, in normal KV that {id, time} value would hash to a new vnode every time. In TS it will hash to the same vnode for an entire time period \u2014 so a 1 minute quantum means it would write 60 values to one vnode.We can now query up to 60 values of data with single request. If we now go to 2 places we can read 120 values, 3 gets us 180 etc, etc. Querying now stops being quite so all-or-nothing \u2014 we are smoothing out the query mechanism.TS data colocation introduces a new way to go to data \u2014 blurring the all or nothing behaviour of KVData colocation on disk in TSBut access to the ring is only part of the story \u2014 the TS data is also written consecutively on disk which means a query can just scoop a big slurp of data up in one go:How data is grouped on the metal in Time SeriesThe vnode is itself an ordered set of data. Within a vnode each bucket (whether KV or TS) is written contiguously, and within a TS buckets the quantums of data are written contiguously. We will see how this maps to CRDT sets later.Queryable structured dataThe third component we need to understand with relation to TS and queries is the structure of the value in TS.Previously we talked of writing with a composite key {{id, time}, value} but in TS the value was also structured \u2014 depending on the bucket.A bucket would be defined with a CREATE TABLE statement:CREATE TABLE GeoCheckin (    id           SINT64    NOT NULL,    region       VARCHAR   NOT NULL,    state        VARCHAR   NOT NULL,    time         TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,    weather      VARCHAR NOT NULL,    temperature  DOUBLE,    PRIMARY KEY (      (id, QUANTUM(time, 15, 'm')),       id, time    ))Let\u2019s unpack this:the element that is being written is a tuple with this structure{id, region, state, time, weather, temperature} for instance {12345, \"us-east\", \"virginia\", 2017-9-05 16:04:23, \"hot\", 23.4}the first thing that happens is that the tuple being passed in is checked against the structure, the first element is of type sint64 the second is a varchar etc, etcthe partition key \u2014 the one that is hashed to get where in the ring to write the data to is {12345, 2017-9-05 16:00:00} (notice how it has been \u2018rolled back\u2019 or quantized to 4pm)the local key \u2014 the key used to write the data to disk is {12345, 2017-9-05 16:04:23} (this has not been rolled back/quantized)the value is {12345, \"us-east\", \"virginia\", 2017-9-05 16:04:23, \"hot\", 23.4}So these three elements make TS queryable more quickly:colocation of data on the ring reduces where you have to go to get datacolocation of data on disk reduces how much data you have to iterate overknown and assertable structure of the data ensures that you can query it deterministically \u2014 only running sum against data of type sint64 or double but not boolean or varchar etc, etc. You don\u2019t have the hell of casting and spoofing default values that you get with entirely unstructured data. You can of course hide unstructured data in varchar or blob fields for semi-structured dataQueries and CRDTs(I am going to proceed on the basis that you understand what CRDTs are, how they work and what their limitations are. If you don\u2019t this is a basic introduction and this is Russell Brown\u2019s Erlang User Conference presentation.)When we were building TS I was always trying to figure out how to extend the SQL query function to KV. So I was pondering how to mate the camel to the goat: an SQL query parsing system designed for TS to conflict-free replicated data types. It turned out to be super-easy once we realised that not all CRDTs are equivalent \u2014 in particular that CRDT sets and maps are structural CRDTs and not \u2018data types\u2019 in their own right.Using the lessons of query language design from Hypernumbers I started trying to map the various concepts onto each other to see if they fitted.Maps are schemasWell maps can be used to implement schemas. A CRDT map is a collection CRDT that can contain other CRDTs: including CRDT sets, CRDT counters, CRDT flags and CRDT registers.We have seen in TS that we can map a CREATE TABLE statement to an Erlang tuple: {id, region, state, time, weather, temperature}. With TS we simply write that raw tuple to disk without any causal information.But if we use a CRDT map to store that information we can create a data structure with embedded causal information (vector clocks) which we can represent as {\ud83d\udd56, id, region, state, time, weather, temperature}.So generally CRDT maps are currently used in an unstructured fashion, values of type any are place in arbitrary slots in the map. With a schema in front of it a CRDT maps becomes structured dataSets colocate data on the ring (and on disk)Some users of CRDT sets on Riak stuff a hundred thousands things into them. Each CRDT set is written to disk as a single object \u2014 that\u2019s your colocation right there \u2014 but that\u2019s also one of the problems.It would be good to be able to query a set: add up all the values in a set, calculate the average and so on and so forth \u2014 ideal work for SQL.The implementation of CRDTs in riak is monolithic. Russell Brown was working on a \u2018big sets\u2019 implementation (with the same semantics) where each element was written to disk separately (as were the metadata and vector clocks).In the monolithic implementation of CRDT sets not only did you have to read the entire set into memory to operate on it, and you had to replicate the entire set to the other primaries.Sets of maps can represent projected joinsA CRDT set is another collection element \u2014 you can think of it as a an array with causal information. In an unstructured way it can contain a set of anything, but if we hide it behind a schema we can insist that it only contains CRDT maps, each with a key, and those maps all have type information imposed on them because they in turn implement a schema.By inserting this set of maps into another map we can represent a projected table join. That is a bold assertion \u2014 but lets see what I mean by that.Consider three tables connected by foreign keys:Simple table joinsWe can project out the joins, here the projections are colour-coded:Join all the thingsAnd then pull out the projected joins. We represent the first table as a map, one of whose elements is a set, which contains the relevant entries from the second table implemented as maps, and each of those maps contain a set that contains the relevant entries of the third table as maps, all wrapped up in a vector clock with the causal information:Its turtles all the way down\u2026In practical terms it looks like this:{Beta, {\ud83d\udd62, Beta, Russell, Brown, TransactionSet}Where TransactionSet contains 2 objects:{\ud83d\udd57, {Beta, 2}, 1/9/15, Deposit, \u00a3350, ActivitySet1}{\ud83d\udd59, {Beta, 3}, 1/9/15, Deposit, \u00a3200, ActivitySet2}And ActivitySet1 and ActivitySet2 are:{\ud83d\udd58, {Beta, 2, 0002}, 1/9/15, Confirm,   JSmith}{\ud83d\udd5e, {Beta, 2, 0006}, 3/3/15, Authorise, JScobie}and{\ud83d\udd57, {Beta, 3, 0004}, 2/9/15, Confirm,   DScobie}{\ud83d\udd52, {Beta, 3, 0005}, 2/9/15, Authorise, KHart}There is a prototype that lets you create two joined tables and insert data into either of them and query against them \u2014 the \u2018famous\u2019 Afrika. It is a very primitive in-memory database that uses the state of a gen server for storage.It uses the monolithic CRDTs of riak to implement it. This model is not-performant enough for production use \u2014 getting there required Russell Brown\u2019s Big Sets and Big Maps.As we saw early, sets and maps in Riak were implemented as single objects \u2014 written to, and read from disk in a single operation and passed around the ring to replicas for reconciliation.By contrast in Big Sets (and Big Maps had the work continued) changes to a set were made as deltas. So add a single element to set or map and then send a delta of the change to the replicas:Deltas for the winOne of the benefits of doing joins this way is that the operations on Big Sets/Big Maps are transactional \u2014 so multi-table updates can be bundled into a single atomic transaction \u2014 for a subset of SQL. This is an important abstraction for application developers and allows them to decompose the objects they work with in their applications and reason about the actions that result from write and updates of the data.Enumerated data types in the schema are an important mechanism as well. We have seen from the work on spreadsheets how vital they are to flesh out data models.We have seen that projected joins require a left hand key to be persisted to a ring. In traditional data models a given table may be on the many end of more than one one-to-many joins \u2014 making it not suitable for eventually consistent CRDTs.The number of these tables can be pruned by implementing the simplest data enforcement rules by enumerated data types. Consider the following table definition:CREATE TABLE GeoCheckin (    id           SINT64    NOT NULL,    region       VARCHAR   NOT NULL,    state        VARCHAR   enum(\"AL\", \"AK\", \"AR\", \"AZ\", ...)    time         TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,    weather      VARCHAR NOT NULL,    temperature  DOUBLE,    PRIMARY KEY (      (id, QUANTUM(time, 15, 'm')),       id, time    ))Traditionally the state field would be constrained by being a foreign key to a separate table that contains a set of suitable states. Enumerated data sets allow that foreign key to be compressed into the table definition.A lot of the delay in getting to eventually consistent SQL joins was the delay in getting Big Sets into production \u2014 a task somewhat hampered by the management not putting any resource into \u2014 despite actual paying customers wanting actual performance improvements in actually implemented technologies.Now that the ship has gone done, hopefully the Big Sets work can escape into the wild.One of the advantages of the monolithic CRDT object libraries is that they are easy to utilise in other systems \u2014 either add them as an Erlang dependency or do a straight port into other languages.However the evidence from Afrika is that if you wish to get sophisticated and performant user friendly ways of manipulating them you will need to bake causality into your implementation \u2014 Big Sets (and Big Maps) were to become the very fabric of next-gen Riak.Final WordsI leave you with some images I commissioned on Fiverr \u2014 Professor Lamport and his causal front-ear.I commend this work to you, and gies a job!Tweet me @gordonguthrie.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Programming", "Erlang", "Riak", "Sql", "Crdt"]}, {"title": "The value of fan remixes as part of artists\u2019 content strategy", "post_link": "https://medium.com/music-x-tech-x-future/the-value-of-fan-remixes-as-part-of-artists-content-strategy-e1c67ec81223?source=search_post", "author_name": "Bas Grasmayer", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@basgras", "publish_date": "2016-12-12", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-04", "readtime": "3.01", "claps": 19, "voters": 19, "content": "The value of fan remixes as part of artists\u2019 content strategyPutting fan remixes in the spotlight is a hundred thousand times more valuable than taking them down.Bas GrasmayerFollowDec 12, 2016 \u00b7 4 min readThe scarcest good on the internet is attention. Any savvy artist, manager, or label employee knows this and develops strategies to sustain the attention of fans over long periods of time.This comes in the form of content strategies, where the social media outlets of artists turn into media with frequent updates. It\u2019s a pretty tiring process and can take a lot of focus away from other important activities.Social media is so exciting\u2026But it\u2019s necessary.One way to sustain attention is to connect fans together and have them keep each other\u2019s attention on you. It\u2019s something I wrote about in 2011 and preceding years, and since then, a lot has changed. For the better.We have powerful connected devices in our pockets at all times. Our web browsers have also grown more powerful, with the Web Audio APIs enabling a lot of new possibilities. And basically everyone is on social media now.Throughout the last year, I\u2019ve spoken to the founders of apps and platforms like Pacemaker, MetaPop, and 8Stem. All enabling people to take existing music and mix it, or remix it, and then publish it. Legally.None of these would have been possible 5 years ago, but with current technology and in today\u2019s landscape they make a lot of sense.Remix culture is going mainstream and \u2018listeners\u2019 are increasingly being shifted from passenger to driver\u2019s seat.Instead of creating all of your own content, why not let fans do some?As a matter of fact, they\u2019re already doing it. Look at the fanbases of the Monstercat and Lapfox Trax labels. It seems exceptional, but it\u2019s just about the culture you create around yourself as an artist or label.Instead of taking down unauthorized remixes, give them a spotlight.So what if there\u2019s no immediate way to get those 5 cents of revenue from the 5,000 streams it\u2019s going to garner? It\u2019s a hundred thousand times more valuable having an inclusive culture in your fanbase, and a following of fans that actually participate in what you\u2019re creating.And when I say a hundred thousand times, I mean it.Taking a fan remix down over a tiny bit of revenue can alienate a fan and stop them from spending money on you, but the value of a highly engaged fan that actually helps you seed your content strategy\u2026 Could it be $5,000? Sometimes, yes. Sometimes even more.Get a read of how many of your fans also make music.Figure out how to make it easier for them to make their own edits.Got a lot of bedroom producers as fans?

I posted this article a few weeks ago:12 Types of Commenters on Medium.Which Medium Junkie Are You?medium.comPat Aitcheson shared what type of commenter she was and added that(\u2026) all creativity is a remix and a good idea is worth elaborating on.I couldn\u2019t agree more here with Pat. Creatives often search for original, novel ideas. They want to be inventors creating a category instead of following a safer path and making pieces based on what\u2019s already out there.It\u2019s risky and costly to make something never seen before. You will have to introduce the idea and do extensive testing to minimize your risks. If your product joins a successful category, most of the testing has been already done and you\u2019ll be able to focus on your systems and logistics.In my upcoming book Your Creative Career, I\u2019m exploring the notion of Accessorizing the Giants. It\u2019s surprising how few creatives opt in to create accessories for successful products. It seems that most entrepreneurs want to make giants. Creating giants feeds our ego but this strategy is risky. It\u2019s safer to accessorize successful products which already exist.Why don\u2019t we write books in genres that sell? Some writers go even as far as admitting that their books form a category themselves. What\u2019s our creative why? Are we so addicted to feeding our ego that we can\u2019t take a step back and evaluate which creative path is less risky and follow it?You don\u2019t have to be an inventor to be a successful creative. You can remix creatively.Austin Kleon and Jeff Goins go even as far as saying that artists steal, infuse their individuality and release the new version as their own. There is nothing wrong with remixing what has already been tested, what works and what\u2019s liked. I\u2019d say that this is a safe and proven formula for success.So many say that being a creative entrepreneur is risky but those same voices believe that creativity is based on inventing. Yes, it\u2019s very risky to invent and make new concepts successful especially if you don\u2019t have a known brand to back up the concept or a wide audience to follow what you do. Yet everyone can remix, curate, get inspired by already proven concepts. There\u2019s no concept police who will dissect your idea and analyze where its pieces came from.What is more, original creators may be flattered that you are giving their concepts longevity and legacy.Ryan Holiday in his new book Perennial Seller talks about creating art with longevity. Holiday emphasizes that for art to achieve longevity, its creator has to be a maker and a marketer.I\u2019d add that we don\u2019t have a choice anymore. We have to market what we make or our products will be unnoticed and unsold. Coming up with creative ways to market is a part of our entrepreneurial journey, part of our creative remix. Following what works as far as promotional efforts and replicating it is exactly what us creatives should be doing. The creative remix will never be the same \u2014 products are different, founders have different skills, place and timing will be different. It\u2019s impossible to recreate something even if you tried it.There are too many components of the system to copy it all.There\u2019s nothing wrong with copying a marketing strategy since you\u2019ll be applying it to a different product anyway.Some founders who aspire to be inventors fear to be copied to the point of not revealing their products until completion. Because they didn\u2019t test, they often discover that they\u2019re the only ones who recognize their products\u2019 greatness. Some may get caught up convincing others and explaining what\u2019s great while others will treat it as a lesson and adapt the collaborative spirit. They\u2019ll take into account their customers\u2019 taste and feedback adjusting the components that don\u2019t work, tweaking and making better versions, more creative remixes.If you hold on to inventing, consider letting your creative secrets go. Share what you have, exchange, get feedback and keep creating. It\u2019s not about being first and having your ego fed. Ultimately, it\u2019s about succeeding on your own terms. Being an entrepreneur is already risky enough. Mitigating risks by remixing what\u2019s been working is a successful strategy worth replicating.If you enjoyed reading this post, please recommend and share it to help others find it!Newsletter for creatives: I share my stats from an experiment of writing on Medium everyday + some secret tips and tricks for creatives.The Mission publishes stories, videos, and podcasts that make smart people smarter.

How streets are designed, and for what modes, are the clearest physical reflection of who cities value most.As private vehicles and operators vie for public space on our streets, cities must focus on their unique role and responsibility: efficiently moving as many people to where they want to go \u2014 as safely and equitably as possible. Emerging mobility technologies will continue to change how we use streets, so cities must proactively think ahead \u2014 to establish a responsible framework, to plan how these new options best fit in while supporting the existing transportation backbone.But AVs!?! \ud83d\ude32 \u201cThe problem of the city is a problem of sharing space.

In anticipation of c/o pop convention 2017, we take a look at some of the players breathing new life into the practice.Bas GrasmayerFollowJun 8, 2017 \u00b7 6 min read\u201cThe future of remix culture\u201d will be one of the topics at the c/o pop Convention 2017, one of Germany\u2019s leading music industry conferences and showcase festivals (Cologne, 16\u201320th August).The rise of the remix went hand-in-hand with hiphop and electronic dance music in the 80s and 90s. These two genres are born out of a democratisation of music production, mainly through drum computers and samplers.Later, the desktop computer, with powerful \u2014 and often pirated \u2014 digital audio workstation software, further enabled remix culture. By then, hiphop, house, drum & bass and other types of music had familiarized young people with the notion of remixing, and the easiest way to produce something decent-sounding as a new producer was by sampling or editing other people\u2019s work.Then the internet happened, meaning you could build an audience through music distribution platforms like Napster. Since these platforms initially were entirely search-driven, you\u2019d have to include something in your metadata that people were actually looking for. This led to producers adding false labels to their tracks with awesome \u2014 and completely fictional \u2014 line-ups of artists. Yet the same dynamic also further popularized remixing and mash-ups, since they\u2019d contain the keywords people would actually search for.The popularity of the word \u2018remix\u2019 in books, according to data from GoogleThis all occurred before the smartphone. The iPhone, to name one, has only been around for about 10 years. The smartphone provides an incredible new tool for creating mixes, remixes, mashups, and sampling real-world sounds and images. It also provides a new context for distributing and experiencing these music formats, with platforms like Musical.ly, Vine, and Flipagram enabling the rise of the 15 second song, and making it interconnected with the video through which people consume it.An example of a track that blew up on Vine. (Run, by Awolnation)Remixing is the new punkIn a chat with Sub Pop founder Bruce Pavitt, who released the first albums of Nirvana, Mudhoney, and Soundgarden, he likened today\u2019s remix culture with the rise of punk. With punk, suddenly anyone could pick up a guitar and express themselves without having had much practice or training. Now, with computers in our pockets that are more powerful than the computers on our desktops a few years ago, we can do that again.So Pavitt founded 8Stem, together with Adam Farish, who\u2019ll be speaking at the c/o pop Convention in August. The 8Stem app has artists releasing their tracks in stem format, of which remixed stems are also made available in the app. Users of the app can listen to the tracks, reconfigure the stems, replace parts of songs with other stems, apply effects, and publish their personal remixes inside the app. These remixes can then be found and listened to by other users, including the original artist. They can even be re-remixed.Releasing stems for others to use is not new. Remix competitions are common, especially in electronic music, in which producers are encouraged to buy stem packs and then upload their remixes to Soundcloud with a special tag to enter it into the competition.The startup Tracklib is building a library full of stems, which can be purchased, used, and licensed at fair and transparent rates through the platform.Eventually, music will respond to environments and other influences, through apps like Weav, which makes music elastic and respond to the pace you\u2019re moving at. This will thrive as our environments get more connected, smarter through AI, and our smartphones get even more powerful.Mixtapes for the mobile eraFor mobile-first mixtapes, there is Pacemaker, which recently completed the prestigious Techstars Music startup acceleration program. What originally started as a hardware startup which released a pocket size DJ system, the startup is now focused on building an app which makes it easier for anyone to create a mix.Pacemaker lets you import your Spotify playlists and their AI will mix them for you at the tap of a button. You can then edit the transitions, or just play it as it is. Like 8Stem, the app allows you to publish your mix inside their platform, so that others can listen to it. By letting users sign in with Spotify, the app avoids the legal issues that Soundcloud has been plagued by for years.An app screenshot of PacemakerMixcloud a platform specifically built to host DJ mixes, last year announced they had over 1 million uploaders, with many more listeners. In an interview with Xanthe Fuller, head of community with Mixcloud and speaker at the c/o pop Convention 2017, she talks about how niche sounds are finding their place on the service:\u201cRed Light Radio in Amsterdam upload a wealth of experimental and unusual shows and they have commented that people seem increasingly open-minded and curious. They are not just demanding to hear what they know.\u201dThe relation of original artist & remixerThe challenging part for remix culture have always been the legal hurdles. On one side, there are those who feel culture should be accessible to all, and people should be able to sample, mix, and remix other people\u2019s work (the open-source documentary RiP!: A Remix Manifesto comes to mind). Those who are opposed have varying reasons, from wanting control over how their music sounds and is listened to, to issues of monetization.For the latter issue, the fact that so many people are now listening to music through licensed services, whether YouTube, Soundcloud, or Apple Music, is great news. Pacemaker, for instance, knows exactly how much of each song is used in a mix, and can tell Spotify when the songs are played. Mixcloud makes users upload their tracklists and timestamp their mixes, so they can pay out rightsholders accordingly.MetaPop, a startup founded by former Beatport CEO Matthew Adell, has the stated aim of clearing up rights for remixes, so that the original artist and remixer can both get paid fairly. This strategy of growing the pie for everyone is likely to win over artists that never believed in leaving unauthorized remixes online. The startup was acquired by Native Instruments (NI), which builds some of the world\u2019s most popular software for music production, DJing, as well as hardware. It\u2019s unclear exactly what NI plans to do with the startup, but it bears keeping in mind that they also released Stems, a music format which allows DJs to remix music on the fly.Through the apps highlighted, streaming platforms, and social media in general, the relation between remixer and original artist is much more immediate. The streaming economy creates massive amounts of valuable data, and it\u2019s getting easier to process and track that data, with blockchain promising to bring more efficiency, control, and granularity to that eventually. With the rise of machine learning, artificial intelligence, too, will play a role.What it means for the future, and what pioneers in this area are doing to innovate, is something we\u2019ll be discussing at Cologne based conference c/o pop Convention 2017 (17 + 18th August).We hope to see you there.", "responses": 1, "tags": ["Music", "Remix", "Music Business"]}, {"title": "Remix the Science Museum Group Collection #SMGRemix", "post_link": "https://lab.sciencemuseum.org.uk/remix-the-science-museum-group-collection-smgremix-33684aa9212f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Mar", "author_link": "https://lab.sciencemuseum.org.uk/@mardixon", "publish_date": "2018-01-12", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-11", "readtime": "1.27", "claps": 48, "voters": 13, "content": "Remix the Science Museum Group Collection #SMGRemixMarFollowJan 12, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readThis is the second in a series of collaborative remixes from the Science Museum Group\u2019s Digital Lab and founding partner Samsung.Early radios from the Science Museum Group CollectionLet\u2019s Remix the Science Museum Group Collection!Attention designers, UX/UI enthusiasts, historians, science buffs, hackers and people who love data!Join us for a day-long workshop at the Science Museum in London to share ideas and help remix the Science Museum Group\u2019s incredible collection.Work with Science Museum Group Digital Lab, curators and people from the wider technology and cultural sectors.Why?The whole culture sector has struggled with enabling users to easily discover objects from online collections.

Selon Wikipedia, la bienveillance est la disposition affective d\u2019une volont\u00e9 qui vise le bien et le bonheur d\u2019autrui.Nous parlons donc d\u2019altruisme. Cela implique d\u2019apr\u00e8s nous une succession d\u2019\u00e9tapes :- Avoir conscience que l\u2019autre est l\u00e0, et qu\u2019il ou elle est important-e- S\u2019int\u00e9resser \u00e0 lui, entrer en contact, sinc\u00e8rement- Vouloir que cela \u00ab marche \u00bb pour lui comme l\u2019on veut que cela \u00ab marche \u00bb pour soi- Ouvrir son esprit, parfois son coeur\u2026 \u00catre authentiquement et sans calcul, en empathie- \u00catre pr\u00eat \u00e0 donner \u2026 comme \u00e0 recevoir- Communiquer r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement, partager et avancer ensembleLa bienveillance n\u2019est pas qu\u2019une disposition statique, elle est aussi dynamique et transformationnelle.Agir de fa\u00e7on altruiste nous change, nous pousse \u00e0 aller vers l\u2019autre en brisant parfois nos pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s, \u00e0 sortir de notre zone de confort en nous confrontant \u00e0 de nouveaux modes de pens\u00e9es et d\u2019action, et nous fait donc \u00e9voluer.La bienveillance vient aussi en rupture avec l\u2019\u00e9gocentrisme qui pr\u00e9side dans le monde d\u2019avant. Loin des perceptions cyniques, elle est l\u2019un des symboles du monde qui \u00e9merge.Et transformer le mondeLa bienveillance implique ainsi le r\u00e9apprendre \u00e0 vivre ensemble. Et quand l\u2019on se demande \u00ab pourquoi parle-t-on tant de bienveillance en ce moment ? \u00bb nous voyons qu\u2019outre son aspect transformationnel et vertueux au niveau personnel, elle est le r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur d\u2019un point de basculement; celui entre le monde d\u2019avant et le monde d\u2019apr\u00e8s.Les r\u00e9percussions sont nombreuses, en voici quelques unes :- Le monde \u00e9tait vertical, hi\u00e9rarchique et b\u00e2ti sur le rapport de force, il est horizontal, fond\u00e9 sur la notion d\u2019accompagnement et de partage (ce qui n\u2019emp\u00eache d\u2019ailleurs ni les r\u00e8gles, ni la notion d\u2019autorit\u00e9, mais c\u2019est un autre sujet).- \u00ab Moi je \u00bb passait avant tout quitte \u00e0 faire de gros d\u00e9g\u00e2ts pour se hisser sur le devant de la sc\u00e8ne, le collectif va d\u00e9sormais passer devant car il n\u2019est plus tenable de refuser de prendre en compte les personnes autour de nous ou m\u00eame de leur nuire d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment.- Les postures marketing ou politiciennes nous glissent \u00ab litt\u00e9ralement \u00bb dessus. La bienveillance devient une cl\u00e9 de d\u00e9cryptage du monde. Et quand ce monde est faux, artificiel ou utilise en somme les recettes du monde d\u2019avant, nous n\u2019y adh\u00e9rons tout simplement plus. Au passage, l\u2019on comprend pourquoi l\u2019abstentionnisme est si fort. Qui croit encore au leader providentiel franchement ?Car nous n\u2019avons plus le choixComprendre la bienveillance comme une disposition vertueuse pour chacun et structurante pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est un premier pas.Il faut aussi faire face \u00e0 notre monde brutal et quasi-cataclysmique et savoir accepter :- Que la croissance infinie est une lubie du monde d\u2019avant, tout simplement parce que nous avons compris que les ressources, elles, sont limit\u00e9es et qu\u2019il faut une croissance raisonn\u00e9e. Croissance de toute fa\u00e7on structurellement faible d\u00e9sormais dans nos soci\u00e9t\u00e9s occidentales.- Que la fulgurante innovation nous rend bien des services mais s\u2019appr\u00eate aussi \u00e0 nous remettre en question.- Que la pr\u00e9carit\u00e9 n\u2019est plus une crainte lointaine mais notre quotidien, en tant qu\u2019ind\u00e9pendants et startups, certes, mais aussi en tant que salari\u00e9s.- Que l\u2019Etat, tente de se d\u00e9battre pour faire le minimum et qu\u2019il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 du mal.- Que les \u00e9lites vivent encore dans le monde d\u2019avant, qui n\u2019est pas notre monde.

Facebook, early on in mobile, capitalized on their network and brand equity in order to provide a login service to developers that both enhanced user trust and reduced onboarding friction. And while today many app developers have begun to eschew Facebook Connect in favor of other keychaining options (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram) or simply using the address book graph/usernames, the appearance of a third-party brand alongside third-party code in marquee consumer apps is becoming more common, not less. At the risk of ironically borrowing from other various themes/theories around collaborative creation, I\u2019ll dub this trend the \u201cremix economy.\u201dPartnerships have always been a crucial part of strategy in business, and in technology it\u2019s been no different \u2014 from open source software projects to channel relationships and everything in between. APIs themselves are also not new \u2014 and ever since early pioneers like Ebay and Salesforce.com brought web APIs into the main, they have exploded in popularity and become integral to the strategy of many tech companies. I think this poignant excerpt from a point.io blog post on enterprises joining the API economy applies just as well to consumer apps leveraging each other\u2019s strengths:Third-party developers are the creative x-factors who will drive your brand into the innumerous niches in which your modern customer segment lives. They are the people who will mix and remix your corporate assets together with those of others to create unique, multidimensional experiences. These novel applications and ideas, which would never be conceived in a corporate boardroom, are precisely what will drive surprising new sources of value for your company and give you access to your competitor\u2019s lunchbox.But lately API integrations \u2014 especially in mobile and consumer web \u2014 are becoming increasingly more public-facing and central to developing a brand and user experience. Take the Spotify-Uber partnership announced recently.\u201cSpotify your Uber\u201d is how Uber\u2019s website characterizes the new integrationIt\u2019s nothing technically mindblowing \u2014 Uber allows you to link a Spotify account to your Uber account, and allows your playlists to be pushed to the driver\u2019s stereo-controlling phone in the car. But the seamless integration delivers not just a delightful listening experience (okay \u2014 at least for the passengers), but also a juxtaposition of two wildly popular brands \u2014 Spotify and Uber. It\u2019s almost like when you find out two of your favorite actors are actually buddies in real life. When I open the Uber app and see that \u2014 \u201chey! my Spotify is here too,\u201d I get that uncanny feeling of everything being in the right place. Uber\u2019s own API looks poised to provide a similar value-add experience but for transportation in other apps.Another great example of this ethos is Snapcash \u2014 the new Snapchat feature that leverages Square Cash in order to facilitate peer-to-peer payments seamlessly within the app. Payments in a messaging app are nothing new, especially for Asian companies like Snapchat investor and WeChat owner Tencent. But I do think it is telling that Snapchat chose not to roll its own payment solution and elected instead to leverage the existing brand and technology of Square. This is not only a nod to specialization \u2014 Square\u2019s business is building payment solutions while Snapchat\u2019s is building a socialization platform \u2014 but also to a mutually beneficial brand relationship where each partner\u2019s strengths are partially conferred by association to the other. Snapchat brings an element of hipness and pop culture relevancy to Square, who in turn blesses the Snapchat platform with its payment & commerce chops.Snapcash demo on AndroidI think this colorful exchange between Jack Dorsey and Evan Spiegel regarding the integration really captures the spirit behind this deal. It\u2019s a great example of tech leaders acting like the DJ\u2019s of their own brand experiences: remixing, collaborating and fine tuning not only their final product but how their product fits into the constellation of other services users love.Lets move to the immediate inspiration for this piece: today\u2019s announcement by Drizly that they will be making their alcohol delivery service available for developers to integrate into their own apps via API. In addition to launch partners such as Miller and Swarm, the API will allow a wave of apps to be enhanced, and perhaps even built, with a co-branded, local alcohol delivery component. In the article above, BostInno mentions a whiskey recommendation app called Distiller. Users will be able to purchase whisky from Drizly right inside their Distiller app, and it\u2019s not hard to come up with a few other uses for this right off the top of your head. Not only do these apps and liquor brands benefit from the technical/logistical heavy lifting that Drizly makes available to them via API, they also can leverage Drizly\u2019s growing but trusted brand among millennials as a cool, upcoming service that many have heard about (if not tried themselves). Launching with Foursquare\u2019s Swarm as a partner really emphasizes the versatility of a platform like this and shows how through one of these \u201cremixes,\u201d social apps and beyond will be able to cleverly integrate e-commerce + more into their apps by partnering up.When things like this are done well, I get a weird feeling of satisfaction. I get the sense that my mobile experience is evolving into something richer and more personally rewarding as my favorite cloud services and apps begin to \u201cplay nice\u201d together. Both self-service API implementations and those borne from coordination behind closed doors are making our apps better and more useful. There are other adjacent trends here at work; the rise of platforms like Stripe for payments and Twilio SMS \u2014 along with newcomers like Dispatch for on-demand services (for whom I did some work recently) \u2014 has begun to change the way applications are developed. But I think that these brand-level partnerships and app remixes will are becoming increasingly more important and visible to the end-user, and ultimately will change how these companies are grown and marketed in addition to how they function.

As an example, TNC passenger trips increased to over 2.6 billion in 2017, a 37% increase from the prior year. This fall, 12 private, relatively new companies submitted comprehensive applications to operate shared electric scooters in San Francisco. In 2017, the shared scooter business model barely existed.Mobility is no longer a simple set of public operators and private individuals. It\u2019s an increasingly complex set of options, innovative new business models, and evolving public policies mixing together to reshape movement in cities.The future of transportation will likely be an increasing proportion of publicly-accessible, privately operated options.To stay ahead, cities must play an active role in managing public and private transportation to ensure equitable, safe, and accessible outcomes. In this changing environment, cities must simultaneously build the internal capacity to understand and plan their desired transportation futures at an equal, if not faster pace.We\u2019ve continually heard that cities desire the ability to adapt to these changes. We also believe that positive change in cities can\u2019t be accomplished through technology alone. That\u2019s why we created the Remix Policy Team. Our goals are to serve as a resource to advance industry best practices and elevate analyses and information critical for the future of mobility in cities.To achieve these goals, we\u2019ve brought together a cast of professionals whose passion is cities and experience spans local government, transportation, and technology. This nexus of skills is critical as planning becomes more data-driven, dynamic, and paired with current transportation practices and policies.\ud83d\udcd2 Remix Policy Briefs: Tactical Guidance for CitiesTo share our research and work, we\u2019ll begin by delivering a cadence of Remix Policy Briefs, highlighting specific topics drawn from our customers and industry partners. Given the continuous change in the industry, the content will adapt over time and serve as a bridge between current practices and information needed to plan tomorrow\u2019s transportation.One example topic is mobility data policy. Jascha Franklin-Hodge weighed-in earlier this week to frame the subject. This is an area that we\u2019re certain to explore further in the upcoming weeks.If a subject generates ongoing interest, we\u2019re also interested in convening panels (online or in-person) or broader industry events similar to the Remix Conference to share findings or prompt further exploration in the space.\ud83d\udef4 Mobility Brief #1: Micromobility: an opportunity to serve the underserved edgesOur first Remix Policy Brief explores one of the newest forms of private shared mobility: \u2018micromobility\u2019 \u2014 dockless bikes, e-scooters, and mopeds. Their rapid proliferation across the United States (and worldwide), has raised many questions regarding their contribution to the larger transportation ecosystem.We see an opportunity for micromobility to connect those living in the underserved edges of urban areas to a city\u2019s larger transportation network. However, these opportunities cannot be realized without the correct policy lens and regulatory requirements to guide positive outcomes. For cities evaluating new mobility policies, the brief offers guidance across several topics:How are different US cities approaching equitable transportation access goals?What topics should every city address in their e-scooter or dockless bikeshare requirements?What metrics are available to evaluate equitable access goals?Sample pages from Mobility Brief #1: Micromobility: an opportunity to serve the underserved edges. Download the full report here.If guided correctly, micromobility can improve access to the greater transportation system in ways unseen from past options. The brief is authored by Rachel Zack, the co-author of San Francisco\u2019s Guiding Principles for Emerging Mobility Services and Technologies.

It\u2018s more profitable to sell products that sell themselves.But if we only invented Painkillers, we wouldn\u2019t have Facebook, Apple, or even Google \u2014 companies founded on the idea that there had to be a \u201cbetter way.\u201dThe reality is, many of us are selling products to customers who aren\u2019t in excruciating pain\u2026 yet. Or they don\u2019t realize a better way exists. Or they don\u2019t realize how fragile their current success is.This is where your story structure comes in.If you missed our first segment on setting the core value of your story, read it here.Use your Story\u2019s core value to set your structureAs we discussed in our last post about making your Customer (not your company) the hero of your story, everything centers around the core value at stake.It\u2019s not about painkillers and vitamins. It\u2019s about what value is at stake.Where your core value falls on the B2B Needs Stack determines whether you\u2019ll have more success taking a logic-driven approach or an emotion-driven approach.Once you know the value at stake for your customer, you can use it to choose your story structure. Selling survival? Hit hard with revenue numbers. Selling esteem? Paint a vision that resonates.Hundreds of customer conversations have helped three key story structures to emerge for my product. While I\u2019m continuing to evolve them each time, I want to share my most common stories with you:The Survival Story: A logic-driven approach for customers who care about revenue upside \u2014 and increasing their chances for survival as a company. Best for Managers at SMBs and startup companies.The Security Story: An approach blending logical practicality and emotional threat for customers who don\u2019t realize how fragile their current stability might be. Best for C-Level at middle market or scaling companies.The Esteem Story: An aspirational, emotion-driven approach for customers who may not see the better way that\u2019s become possible by a big change in the world. Best for C-Level at middle market or Directors at larger enterprise companies.Blank it with bucketsInstead of diving into the details, keep it as high level as possible in the beginning to save yourself hours spent building materials that aren\u2019t a fit.My years at Bain building too many PowerPoint decks to count taught me that you never start a deck by making a slide. Step one is to \u201cblank\u201d it \u2014 by building the whole story out of titles or \u201ctag lines\u201d first.One of the best resources I\u2019ve found on B2B Sales deck content (and B2B sales overall) is from Peter Kazanjy and First Round Capital. In this must-read, Kazanjy suggests using a \u201cbucket\u201d mentality to cover all of your bases:It all boils down to 8 sentences.You want to start by lining up your \u201cbuckets,\u201d but not filling them (that\u2019s for next week). The parts of your structure, then (to reword Kazanjy\u2019s list slightly) are 8 sentences:[What] is the problem.[Who] has the problem most acutely.This problem costs them [How Much] each year.[Who/What] are the existing solutions, but they don\u2019t work because [Why].But no longer! [What] has changed since [When] because [Why].Now, our [What] is possible, and works like [How].It is objectively better than those existing solutions, because [Why].And it costs [How Much].Shape your sparklinesSince I\u2019ve moved to LA, I\u2019ve been seeking sales story inspiration from the source of modern storytelling\u2014 Hollywood. Perhaps its most celebrated screenwriting mastermind, Robert McKee, describes his most important lesson in shaping a story:No scene that doesn\u2019t turn. This is our ideal. We work to round every scene from beginning to end by turning a value at stake in a character\u2019s life from the positive to the negative or the negative to the positive. \u2014 Robert McKeeShaping a story, therefore, is about centering around a value and then creating contrast that puts that value at stake.To see the contrast, Nancy Duarte created sparklines:The line moves between what is(the lower position) and what could be (the higher position) to show contrasts in content. \u2014 DuarteUsing these approaches, I started to flex the \u201csparklines\u201d of my own sales stories by reordering my \u201cMagic 8\u201d according to the type of story I was trying to tell. An overview:The Survival StoryYou\u2019re talking to a customer who is driven by business logic, and is seeking a solution to a problem they know they have. But instead of just solving their problem, push them in a hole to make it get worse before it gets better. Then offer them a ladder (your product) to help them out.The Security StoryYou\u2019re talking to a customer who is balancing logic, but is influenced by emotion, especially the threat of loss. Use contrast to rock the boat and show them how their \u201cstable\u201d position is not as stable as they thought. There is more at stake than it seems \u2014 but you can help them secure the future.The Esteem StoryYou\u2019re talking to an aspirational customer who is driven by an emotional vision for the future \u2014and an openness to a better way.

It permeates through your personal space and hits you unapologetically, warming the soft chill on your cheeks. The soup is hot, but you don\u2019t care. Your patience dissipates, as the emanating fragrance assaults your senses. You peer down at the judicious layering of garnishes, a textural juxtaposition, and ready for the first bite\u2026\u2026..*slurp *cough *sniffleEnjoying a bowl of ramen is a memorable one. One most of us are familiar with since its meteoric rise in the states during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Influencers like David Chang\u2019s Momofuku and Fukuoka\u2019s Ippudo are now household names, and you can even find ramen shops cradled throughout the midwest. We recognize ramen, its silky broth and chewy noodles, as one of Asia\u2019s greatest culinary exports.Sam Hornine, \u201cKTOWN\u201d, Final ShootMy relationship with ramen started at an early age. Dad\u2019s first job was with Samyang, South Korea\u2019s 2nd largest manufacturer of instant ramen, so he brought work home a lot. Our ramen wasn\u2019t accompanied with soft boiled eggs, chashu, and nori, but the elemental dried noodles and dehydrated spice packets became a household staple. Sunday mornings were reserved for family breakfast, and almost always consisted of instant ramen, spam, eggs, and tacky Korean television shows -a setting familiar to many Korean families during that time.Through the years, ramen has slowly waned from my diet, but its early footprints have left an impression. Because for Koreans, ramen is more than a cheap, fast food with a burdened reputation. It\u2019s a collection of memories ranging from high school breakups to sobering indecisions, that stretch far beyond the circumference of a bowl. It\u2019s a representation of a society layered with cultural and culinary importance. It\u2019s the distillation of all qualities and calluses within a community.Today is Sunday here in Seoul. The mornings are brisk, and afternoons warm from the spring sun. And as I sit here on the couch, recovering from a wedding the night before, there\u2019s only one food occupying the kitchen cabinet of our dormant apartment. With some convincing, I move myself across the room and place the golden alloy pot on the stove. And I reach for one of the packages stacked neatly along the top shelf of the cupboard. The scrunch of the bag and its contents ring familiar, as I catch the sound of tiny bubbles starting to dance on the bottom of the pot.It\u2019s almost time. Today\u2019s lunch will be ready in 5\u20137 minutes.Instant Ramen RemixPrep Time: 2\u20133 mins | Cook Time: 5\u20137 mins | Yield: 1 servingIngredients:Shin Ramen or instant ramen of choice2 1/2 cups water1/4 slab of Spam sliced1 egg1/4 onion thinly sliced1 sprig of green onion finely chopped or julienneProcedure:Bring water to boil in small pot over high heatAdd spice packet, dehydrated vegetable mix, and sliced onions and boil for 1\u20132 minutesSear sliced Spam on small pan; 2\u20133 mins per sideTurn down heat on soup mixture to medium high, and add noodlesCover and cook noodles for 3\u20134 minsStir noodles, add egg, and cover for 1 more minTop with spam slices, green onions, and serve hot in potThe most important thing to consider when remixing your ramen is time.

In this related post, we spoke with Remix\u2019s founders about the company\u2019s origins at Code for America and their vision for livable cities. Also, the engineering team is hiring :) Contact the team about that: jobs@remix.com.JP PosmaWhat was your background before Remix?I\u2019ve always focused on social impact products. Before Remix, I worked at political, education, and fact-checking startups. I want my work to have a positive impact. That\u2019s why I ended up here.JPTell us more about what brought you to Remix.Given my background, I had a long list of requests for potential employers; Remix checked a lot of boxes. Most importantly, its mission focuses on social good. I was also impressed by the quality of the engineering here. At interviews, I would ask to see companies\u2019 code. I came in with certain expectations, but I was really impressed. I also saw how well their products were selling, especially considering how hard it is to sell to government.I liked the design too. It\u2019s clear that two of the co-founders are designers \u2014 it\u2019s beautiful and easy to use. Transit has such complexity to it, but the interface distills that complexity into something simple, which is hard to do.Something I didn\u2019t realize when I was interviewing, but appreciate now, is our close relationship with our customers. If we\u2019re introducing a new feature, or we implement a brief shutdown, we just call them. They\u2019re always happy to hear from us. We\u2019re not the usual corporate types in suits trying to sell something. We are transit planners selling to transit planners \u2014 our products are tied directly to our mission.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that two of the co-founders are designers \u2014 it\u2019s beautiful and easy to use.\u201dAnd, of course, I just enjoyed the people here. I had a number of interviews at other companies after I visited here, and I kept thinking about the Remix people. I knew even if I didn\u2019t work for them, I\u2019d want to spend time with them.How will the future be different if Remix is successful?Even with self-driving cars on the horizon, and even if we imagine smaller, faster, computerized, super-efficient cars, the problem of traffic isn\u2019t going away. It\u2019s not geometrically possible to move all the people in one city in individual cars. Efficient transit networks are essential.There\u2019s also the idea of open data. While some of the data we use is already publicly accessible \u2014 bus schedules, census information \u2014 we\u2019re also gathering data about where people live and work and the percentage of low-income people without cars. We\u2019ve included all these data points on our maps. It\u2019s exciting to think about opening that up for other people\u2019s use.Improving transit systems contributes to energy efficiency and, we believe, financial equity. A lot of people can\u2019t afford their own vehicle. Public transit gives them access to jobs they couldn\u2019t otherwise reach.What kind of challenges are you tackling day to day?One thing I didn\u2019t expect when I joined Remix was how many hardcore computer science problems we run into. We\u2019re dealing with classic optimization problems and constraint satisfaction problems, like: How do you use as few buses as possible to cover the distance you want, or the number of trips in your system? Part of our product is figuring out how you provide the most service possible with the resources available. It\u2019s really interesting to take classic computer science algorithms and use them in new contexts.\u201cOne thing I didn\u2019t expect when I joined Remix was how many hardcore computer science problems we run into.\u201dRecently, we had to solve the \u201cshortest common supersequence problem\u201d for a particular case; we were looking for existing solutions to that problem. There really aren\u2019t any because it\u2019s an NP-complete problem, which means you can only get approximations. But all the approximations we found were from bioinformatics, which is a very different data set than we have. So we had to come up with our own, brand-new solution that ended up working really well for our type of data.Another challenge is presenting detailed geographic information with clear visuals. One thing we\u2019re working to improve is how to visualize, for instance, 10 bus lines operating on the same street.Has Remix changed the way you think in any way?I knew nothing about transit when I started. Now it\u2019s always on my mind. Previously, I didn\u2019t think twice when taking the bus; you take it for granted. Now I know exactly how much work goes into it.Team members arrive at the office by bike, train, bus, and board.Sandy RyzaTell us about what you were doing before Remix.I just started six days ago. Before that, I worked as a data scientist for Clover Health, which is a health insurance startup. I think the common thread between Clover and Remix is that they\u2019re mission-driven companies dealing with infrastructure that\u2019s sort of at the backbone of society. At Remix, I\u2019m in more of an engineering role than a data science role \u2014 I work on the algorithms behind our platform. I think what\u2019s appealing to me in both cases is engineering a system that sits on top of some sort of algorithmic intelligence, whether that\u2019s identifying patients that need a reminder to take their medication or identifying the most efficient way to staff a set of transit routes.SandyWhat compelled you to join Remix?A combination of things. I was really interested in transit; it\u2019s always excited me. I also get excited about the particular strain of algorithmic problems we work on here. And I wanted to work for a company that had a shot at making things better for those outside the affluent, tech-savvy cohort that a lot of tech companies cater to.The fact that Remix even existed was surprising to me. It was exactly what I was looking to do without knowing the opportunity existed. It encouraged me that in 2017, tech startups can still contribute positively to transit.\u201cI wanted to work for a company that had a shot at making things better.\u201dDoes the future look different with Remix in it?Definitely. A better future with Remix means better transit for people who need it. That means the best and most frequent routes. Remix focuses on both helping transit planners discover new opportunities, and reducing costs so they spend resources more effectively.What\u2019s different about working at Remix compared to other experiences you\u2019ve had?One big thing is how thoughtful the management team is. They know each employee well, and they\u2019re willing to put time into figuring out the best way to organize the company \u2014 to foster a culture that values both productivity and employees\u2019 happiness.Lunch at the office\u2019s communal tables.Dory LittleWhat were you doing before you joined Remix?Before Remix, I was at Google, where I worked on the Google Maps app for about five years. I also worked on the products Google offers for small businesses, as well as Google Search.I came here because I wanted to work on something more civically focused. Google builds great products, but I wanted my job to directly affect a problem in our country and around the world. I\u2019d read about upward mobility, and one of the things I learned was that access to transit has a significant impact on a person\u2019s ability to improve their circumstances over time.DoryFor example, if you live in a neighborhood where you don\u2019t have access to transportation, it\u2019s more difficult to find a job or go to school. As I learned more about the complexity of transit systems, I was shocked there weren\u2019t better tools available for transit planners.That\u2019s where Remix comes in. We have great mapping technology that directly touches millions of people\u2019s lives. We create tools for one transit planner who can then rethink and transform how transit operates in their city.We hear you also built a Kanye emoji app?Ha. Yeah. It started as a fun side project with my friend Chris. We thought, \u201cOh, wouldn\u2019t it be funny to have Kanye emojis?\u201d Apple had just updated their iOS SDK with some cool new features, including the ability to make custom keyboards. We built a simple app that lets you send Kanye stickers in conversations. Once it was in the app store, it got a lot of buzz. Then, Kanye\u2019s people contacted us \u2014 apparently, Kanye didn\u2019t think it was funny. We told them we were just fans, no hard feelings. Then the Kimoji app launched, like, months later. We\u2019re not saying she copied us, but \u2026What are you working on at Remix?In my role as a product designer, I oversee the functional and visual executions of all our products. Currently, I\u2019m the only product designer at Remix, which means I collaborate across the company; for example, with our growth and success teams. I also work with our engineering team to design and build our products. We research the needs of our customers, which, combined with market research, helps jump-start our designs. Then we prototype and iterate various solutions.\u201cAccess to transit has a significant impact on a person\u2019s ability to improve their circumstances over time.\u201dAt Google, I was working on a consumer product, which makes it easier to understand your users because you yourself are a user. Designing for enterprise products is different since our users have very specialized roles that require years of training. But both situations require you to put yourself in your user\u2019s shoes. To do that, I\u2019ve had to learn a lot about urban planning and transit design, which has been fun. It\u2019s broadened my understanding of how cities are made.What\u2019s different about Remix compared with other places you\u2019ve worked?People say we have a low-ego culture, and I\u2019ve found that to be true. People here are motivated by our mission. We\u2019re all working on the same problem, on the same team, toward a common vision. Day to day, we\u2019re focused on technically complex problems, but we\u2019re always aware of the impact we\u2019re making.What are you excited about as Remix looks forward?I\u2019d like to push the envelope to make the urban planning process faster from idea to execution. Right now, it\u2019s hard for a city to adapt to big changes like new economic influences or immigration. The faster and more efficiently we can update our solutions, the easier it will be for cities to react as their communities change and grow.The office\u2019s large windows overlook a tangle of highways, a constant reminder of the challenges the team is helping alleviate.Matt SteelTell us about why you decided to join Remix.I worked for a railways consultancy in Melbourne, which meant I had experience in transportation. The job posting offered work in that field, but also had some challenging math problems. Solving them required drawing from my undergraduate studies. That excited me.And now that I\u2019m here, I\u2019ve realized the engineering culture differs from my previous jobs \u2014 it\u2019s more precise and more sound. The team cares about process; we test and review our code. We are proud to work with the code base we\u2019ve created, and that helps us do our jobs without getting lost in the weeds.MattWhat are you working on right now?Because we\u2019re still growing, everyone wears various hats here, but we also focus where our experience lies. Right now, I\u2019m helping improve the speed and accuracy of one of our newest tools. That might sound dry, but there\u2019s interesting, hairy math behind it.At its bare bones, it\u2019s an NP-complete optimization problem \u2014 meaning the universe has told us it can\u2019t be solved. Nobody has found a solution that\u2019s fast or consistent enough. So we trick the universe into letting us find an answer. We\u2019ve thrown all the tools in our toolbox at the problem. Every day it works a little better. That\u2019s part of why I\u2019m here. I\u2019m always looking for the interesting mathematical problem. I want to find and solve it before anyone else does.Is there something at Remix you\u2019re particularly excited about, or looking forward to working on?Every once in awhile I have time to take on a compelling side project. Recently I\u2019ve been working with demographic statistics. Right now we use off-the-shelf tools to calculate the population within a quarter-mile of the bus stops along a given line. Those tools are solid, battle-tested, but we\u2019re running into their limitations. The next step is to see if we can give those statistics a wider context \u2014 maybe within a quarter mile of all the bus stops in an entire city, or how many jobs you can reach within 60 minutes\u2019 travel time.What will Remix\u2019s success mean for the future?I\u2019m focused on solving problems, but of course it\u2019s rewarding to see the solutions you\u2019ve worked on affecting real life. We recently visited our customer cities and watched buses rolling out that are using Remix. Seeing the rubber literally hitting the road is satisfying.JP (left) and Sandy (right) head back to the office near Mission and 13th St. from a local coffee shop.Chris HassonWhat were you doing before joining Remix?I did a bunch of things before joining Remix. I worked at Amazon for four years on a few different teams. I left to become the lead developer for an online custom wedding dress platform, which I did for about a year. After that, I launched a blackjack app, Blackjack Genius, that taught people how to play blackjack and get the best odds. Although it didn\u2019t make a lot of money, it did have a widespread audience \u2014 over 10,000 active users at one point.ChrisWhy did you decide to join Remix?Remix offered a nice balance of interesting user interfaces and social impact that other companies didn\u2019t provide. Even though we don\u2019t have millions of customers, our subset of customers affects millions of people. We are one connection away from those millions.Right now we\u2019re building some complicated user interfaces involving interactive timetables and bus-timeline diagrams. We\u2019ve overcome some interesting challenges with rendering tens of thousands of rows of bus timetables without slowing down the page.What other interesting challenges have you solved here?My first big project was automatically matching bus stops to new lines as users draw them. Remix is sketch-planning software: if you want a bus to go down a different road, you probably want to go a certain direction, using the bus stops that are established on one side of that road. But we had no good way of automatically picking the stops once you moved the route. So the big algorithmic challenge was intelligently picking bus stops from a database of tens of thousands of possibilities.\u201cRemix offered a nice balance of interesting user interfaces and social impact.\u201dWe were able to come up with an algorithm that picked the appropriate bus stops about 95% of the time. First, we find stops near the line. From there, we narrow down the list by removing stops on the other side of the street. To do that, we maintain a list of which side of the road the bus drives on in every country. Buses coming from all directions tend produce clusters of stops, so the final step is running a clustering algorithm which groups nearby stops together and then picks a single stop from each group.What have you learned so far from working at Remix?I\u2019ve learned that planning transit is really hard \u2014 much harder than I imagined. I had no idea that transit planners were turning to paper maps and manually driving routes in order to measure the travel times. By giving them better tools, we can dramatically speed up the planning process, which improves transit for everyone.Remix COO and Co-founder Tiffany Chu chats with Field Marketing Manager Lyuda Grigorieva about a direct mail campaign.Dmitriy YakovlevWhat were you doing before you joined Remix?I worked on consumer products at Yelp for several years, and I needed a change. I wanted to contribute to tools that created more properly functioning cities. For a long time, this kind of technology was shunned because of its complexity. Now I have the opportunity to improve it and hopefully make people\u2019s lives better.As one of the newer engineers on the team, I\u2019m everywhere. I go all the way from the frontend to the backend on a daily basis. Every day is challenging in that so much is new. I am learning constantly.DmitriyIs there something interesting you worked on before Remix that informs your work here?People expect that everyone here loves public transit and, by extension, hates cars. Yes, traffic congestion is terrible and public transit is important. But I actually build and race cars.Since 2010 I\u2019ve participated in an endurance race called the 24 Hours of LeMons. That taught me a lot about endurance, which is something I bring to my work here. You work as a team to find a vehicle that was destined for the scrap pile, fix it up for $500 total and race it for 16 hours. If your car keeps running that long, you win.That experience, among others in my life, taught me to keep at it. Planning and predicting potential failure points allows you to adjust, which leads to more stability and predictability.And, just like with technology, no matter how much you prepare, things still go wrong. You have to expect the unexpected and be able to come up with rigorous, simple solutions on the fly. We do that on the racetrack and we do that here.That\u2019s really cool. Have you ever won?The Bay Area is actually really competitive so it\u2019s hard to win, but we placed fourth and fifth a couple times. I\u2019m one of the Guinness World Record holders for having the most cars on the race track at the same time \u2014 240 cars.How do you think the future will be different if Remix succeeds?My girlfriend recently tore her ACL, so instead of riding her bike to work she now takes the bus. Her commute takes four times longer than it used to. She\u2019s become keenly aware of how complex planning a city transit system is, and how easily a small mistake can translate to an inconvenient experience for riders. SFMTA recently started working Remix, so hopefully that will all improve.Has working at Remix changed the way you think about things?It\u2019s been inspiring to work with people who care about things that matter to the larger public. You have to care to be miles better than anyone else, and we have a group of people here who do.Interested in joining the team?

Currently, humans are much better at evaluating ideas. This is because humans can interpret ideas rapidly, and because humans can represent ideas in a flexible way and then react to those ideas via thought experiments.It seems possible that computers could eventually get a lot better at evaluating ideas, and in fact it\u2019s something many people are working on. However, even though computers aren\u2019t great evaluators, they can still add value in creativity mainly through randomness. Humans have natural constraints on their thought patterns: priming and framing, fluency and taste all constrain creativity. Computers have no such constraints.YC Remix is a very simple tool. It uses a description template for startup ideas introduced by Paul Graham: <known entity> for <new target>. YC Remix randomly draws from a list of known entities and another list of targets and puts them together. The known entity list is the list of all YC startups that aren\u2019t dead. The probability of picking a given startup is proportional to the Alexa ranking of that startup\u2019s website. The list of targets is comprised of both previous YC startup targets (phrases appearing after \u201cfor\u201d in the descriptions on yclist.com), as well as some targets related to the categories in YC\u2019s requests for startups list.When using YC Remix, some ideas won\u2019t make sense at first. Some may not make sense at all. Some will be ridiculous enough to make you laugh. In my experience, it\u2019s best to think deeply about the idea before moving on to a new one.If I\u2019ve learned anything in graduate school, it\u2019s that better data are more important than a better model. YC funded startups are good data, so even something as basic as randomly combining terms might generate some diamonds. In addition, quality is not determined solely by the input data, but also by the interpretation of the user.

As someone whose music consumption primarily exists of remixes and sampled works, this is a very personal pet peeve of mine. The topic is, finally, getting some attention beyond lawsuits and takedown notices.Earlier this year, a task force from the US Department of Commerce presented their findings of a 2-year study, suggesting that a compulsory license is undesirable. Instead, it recommends that the marketplace be left alone to figure this out. An upcoming key player in this marketplace, is MetaPop: a platform that connects labels, producers and remixers, co-founded by former Beatport CEO, Matthew Adell. To date, MetaPop has signed on over 5,000 labels and helps them clear and monetize fan remixes.I spoke to Matthew about how it got started, why remixes are so important, and the future of the remix landscape and MetaPop\u2019s place in it.A year after selling Beatport to SFX, Matt decided to step down and take some time off. After some time spent relaxing, he started looking for a new challenge, asking:\u201cWhat is not getting solved, because people just think it\u2019s hard?\u201dThis question formed the basis of Matt\u2019s search for intractable problems in the music business. Having always had an interest in derivative works he decided to investigate this problem, because \u201cespecially in music, we\u2019ve seen the behaviour of people making remixes without authorisation really become explosive,\u201d indicating that remixes account for 10% of all music listening on YouTube.To find this out, he teamed up with Michael Mukhin, former CTO of Boomrat, and built a piece of technology called Remix Finder. The purpose of the technology was to understand derivative works online. To start, they created a huge index of remixes, mashups and DJ sets on YouTube. The index contains track information, metadata, and engagement metrics, and over time they could also start seeing the speed and frequency at which these derivatives were taken down. If at all.\u201cWhat we learned is while mashups have hits every now and then, there aren\u2019t a lot of mashups that generate a tremendous amount of engagement on YouTube. DJs have some of the tastemaker names in the world, but we found that other than after-movies from really big festivals, DJ sets weren\u2019t really generating that much engagement on a global scale. The work that was really generating the most engagement, and was leaving the most possible revenue on the table, was what we call the single-song remix.\u201dSo as a starting point, they honed MetaPop\u2019s technology on single song remixes and found that they\u2019re better at finding single song remixes than YouTube\u2019s Content ID tool. On YouTube alone, they identified over 8 million remixes that are currently not monetized for the original artist nor the remixer. This could mean hundreds of millions of dollars currently being left on the table, because according to MetaPop just 2.5 million of those fan remixes generate over a billion plays per month.\u201cSo, we have built a system now that allows rightsholders and remixers to come together on our platform to authorise and monetise all of these fan remixes.\u201dThe platform is intended for all genres. In fact, they found that country music is one of the more popular remix genres on YouTube. But why should artists care about remixes in the first place? Matt explains how back in the day, one would have to press vinyl bootlegs to get remixes out there. It was a slow process.Now music has become part of a constant flow of social media. As a musician, it\u2019s nearly impossible to create enough music to feed this constant flow by yourself, he explains. For remixers, it can help them get noticed, and for the original artist it means an expanded fanbase, and increased revenue.It makes sense. If you make country music, and someone makes an EDM remix of your track, suddenly you\u2019re reaching another demographic that you otherwise wouldn\u2019t. MetaPop\u2019s revenue split, 70/15/15 to the original artist, remixer and MetaPop respectively, can form a great incentive to monetize remixes, as opposed to taking them down.If it\u2019s so valuable to artists and there are hundreds of millions of dollars on the table, then why has nobody cracked this before?\u201cIt wasn\u2019t solved before, because there was no money. And it\u2019s complex. Each country has its own laws for how to deal with derivatives.\u201d The rise of streaming means that now there suddenly is a way to monetize. You wouldn\u2019t be able to track the vinyl bootlegs and monetize them, but with all the music platforms out there now, there\u2019s suddenly a lot more data.Matt also understands that older generations of original artists were more wary of remixes, but this is becoming less the case today.In the next 10 years, he expects remixes to become even more prevalent, because the software and hardware necessary to create them is becoming ever-accessible. In this landscape, we\u2019ll see much less takedowns than we do today, with there being more systems in place to monetize instead. This is where MetaPop\u2019s place is, as a rights-clearing house for derivative works.There\u2019s still a long road ahead. The team currently consists of 5 people, with all the technology being built by 1. The thousands of labels, remixers, and original artists they\u2019ve managed to attract and host is an impressive feat, and testament to many years of experience the team has throughout music & tech.MetaPop\u2019s currently in the process of raising a Series A investment round, so that they can start going global and bring in more music from more places. Besides single song remixes, they want to expand their footprint to cover other forms of derivatives, too, like mashups. The goal is, quite simple: to be able to monetize derivatives more widely and more efficiently.Are MetaPop going to be able to crack this problem? Matt is confident.\u201cNobody else has the right mixture of experience, tech and relationships.\u201dPersonally, I\u2019m happy to see people cracking away at this problem, because its importance is underestimated. There are 2 trends that make it urgent to create a legal base for derivative works:Adaptive music: generations are growing up expecting interactivity from everything in their environment. This is the generation that is growing up trying to swipe magazines, televisions and windows, believing they should be able to interact with it. Their music is going to be adaptive to fit the situation and whims of the listener.The remix is the internet\u2019s language: whether it\u2019s attaching a gif to a tweet, changing the caption on a meme, or filming yourself playbacking on the wildly popular Musically, we use the remix to express ourselves now. Music genres are increasingly behaving like memes: they often start with remixes by bedroom producers giving existing tracks another twist. Take vaporwave, moombahton, nightcore or even edm-trap as an example.This is the way people interact with music now. The world shouldn\u2019t have ignored the inner city kids sampling in the 80s and 90s to create hiphop, but now there\u2019s just no getting around it.Remixing is the new default.Matt and I are both speaking at Amsterdam Dance Event (19\u201323 Oct).Come see us.Written for my weekly newsletter MUSIC x TECH x FUTURE.

Coinciding with the early stages of the Science Museum Group\u2019s large-scale collection digitisation initiative, the day was an opportunity for the participants to explore ways for audiences to discover the Science Museum Group Collection through digital experiences.Teams formed in the morning around a set of initial themes, platforms and audiences, and then workshopped these through the day. Rather than taking a hack-a-thon format \u2014 in which teams compete to deliver a technical output \u2014 the day aimed for a collaborative approach and a user experience focus in which the outputs could be sketches, flowcharts, wireframes and other paper-based formats that communicated the audience\u2019s experience.Some groups merged to collaborate during the day while others split to output more than one idea. The final groups were:AlexSciCurator SpaceExtra Hot SauceGamificationMuseum ObscuraWheel of FortuneWikidata Link UpWithin the diverse range of responses to the challenge of engaging audiences with the breadth and depth of the digitised Science Museum Group Collection, it was interesting to see a number of similar themes and threads emerging through the day.Surprisingly (or perhaps not), almost all of the groups immediately moved beyond the traditional museum collection website experience to explore new, more playful forms of engagement and interaction. These included:chat bot interfaces that responded to the content and context of users\u2019 messages;3D spaces populated by 3D scans of museum objects curated by audiences themselves;emotive, journalistic stories that resonate with broad audiences (e.g. \u201cIT problems of the 1960s\u201d);\u201cwheel of fortune\u201d style journeys that spin users off down unexpected paths providing serendipitous discovery of objects through links that are both \u201cformal\u201d taxonomies and \u201cinformal\u201d such as emotions;6-degrees-of-separation games that explore the hidden links between objects and challenge audiences to piece them together.The second major theme of the day was the need for solid data on which to build these experiences. Computers like structured information and almost every proposal used data in some form and would be improved by richer data about the objects.Two proposals looked at ways to build on the Science Museum Group Collection catalogue / data set and to use external sources to and richness and depth to the audience experience. These proposals explored:powerful interfaces to discover related content across third-party websites: museums, libraries, content aggregators, etc.;Building new taxonomies which resonate with (and enable the creation of experiences that resonate with) audiences, for examples around emotions or the national curriculum;integration with Wikidata (the dataset underlying Wikipedia) to draw out the richness of the links in Wikidata related to the collection such as links to locations, dates, and other entities and then use of that wider dataset to build timelines and map interfaces.Finally, the idea of randomness came up a few times through the day as a way for audiences to make serendipitous discoveries. Throughout the day the room\u2019s projector cycled through random object images every 10 seconds or so and it was compelling just to watch this as the image jumped from airplanes to art prints to Roman attracts to medical implements.Since the SMG Collections Remix, we\u2019ve been digesting a wealth of ideas and approaches generated, gathering our thoughts and plotting out a roadmap of possible initiatives, prototypes and proofs of concept that we will work on alongside the digitisation of the SMG Collection.Thanks to Jamie, Emily, Dave, Jess, Will, Mar, Zs\u00f3fia and Veronica for preparing for and running the day, to all the Science Museum Group colleagues who attended, and especially to all the external attendees who braved the ice and snow to be with us.Collections Remix was part of the Group\u2019s Digital Lab initiative supported by founding partner Samsung.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Museums", "Smgremix", "Musetech", "Science Museum", "Collections"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@veeveeveeveevee/fresh-out-da-box-remix-d733cab66a69?source=search_post", "author_name": "KOOL A.D.", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@veeveeveeveevee", "publish_date": "2017-08-15", "last_modified_date": "2018-08-25", "readtime": "1.86", "claps": 62, "voters": 10, "content": "Aztec YogaFresh Out Da Box RemixKOOL A.D.FollowAug 15, 2017 \u00b7 2 min readListen to this story--:----:--Uncle Riffs was fresh out the box, he\u2019d gotten hemmed up for bank robbery but he\u2019d served his time and now he was having a beer with Fausto.\u201cHow was the clinko?\u201d\u201cHow you think?\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s it feel to be out?\u201d\u201cHow you think?\u201d\u201cBeen reading my dad\u2019s book.\u201d\u201cThat garbage?

As a civic tech company, we are strongly shaped by Code for America\u2019s values \u2014 starting with the core belief that \u201cgovernment can work for the people, by the people, in the digital age.\u201dAs we\u2019ve expanded our lens from transit planning to street planning and mobility management, we always focus on outcomes that result from data-driven public policy. These public policy outcomes are shared by many\u2014 such as equitable access to mobility services, sustainability, and safety. We\u2019ve built strong partnerships with both cities and mobility providers that agree on the value of data to reshape mobility. We believe that when cities and mobility companies work together in a spirit of collaboration, the resulting outcomes are more powerful for all involved \u2014 and successful companies can thrive alongside public good rather than in opposition to it.Today, we\u2019re proud to announce that Jascha Franklin-Hodge, former Chief Information Officer of the City of Boston, and Meera Joshi, former Commissioner of New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission, will be advising Remix as we work with our city customers and partners to achieve the best transportation outcomes for all. Both Jascha and Meera bring a wealth of policy experience that will be invaluable in such a rapidly changing environment.Jascha Franklin-HodgeJascha is a national thought-leader on data governance. During his tenure as Chief Innovation Officer at City of Boston, Jascha created the City\u2019s first Digital Team to build exceptional, user-centered digital services, such as the award-winning Boston.gov and BOS:311 mobile app. He also established a Citywide Analytics Team to apply the tools of modern data analysis and modeling to improve quality of life in the city, enhance the operations of government, and support data-driven policy making. His team addressed issues as diverse as transportation policy, firefighter safety, workforce diversity, and ambulance response times. Jascha also spearheaded city policy and programs related to broadband and digital equity, created a digital constituent communication program, and led Boston to be the first-ever city to negotiate a data sharing agreement with Uber in 2015.Prior to his career in public service, Jascha founded Blue State Digital and led the technical infrastructure that powered the success of the 2008 Obama campaign. Jascha recently finished his term as a Joint Research Fellow with the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy and the Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston at the Harvard Kennedy School. He authored Remix\u2019s latest policy brief, \u201cA Practical City Guide to Mobility Data Licensing.\u201dMeera JoshiMeera is the former Commissioner of NYC\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), where she oversaw the largest private for-hire ground transportation industry in the US, making a million trips a day. Under her leadership, the agency fostered tremendous diversity, growth, and innovation in the taxi, car service, ride-hailing, and commuter van industries while maintaining the highest standards of public safety and consumer protection. Meera initiated programs that have made TLC a national leader in data analysis, accessibility for individuals with disabilities, protecting drivers\u2019 pay, and traffic safety.Meera is a vocal advocate for the value that robust transportation data brings to policymakers and citizens alike, and under her tenure NYC became the first city in the nation to require detailed data from large app operators. By making much of this data public, she has become a leader in the Open Data movement. Under her leadership, NYC created the largest wheelchair-accessible for-hire fleet in the country, including a program that centrally dispatches a wheelchair-accessible taxi on demand to anywhere in the five boroughs, and created the first pay protection for drivers of app services like Uber and Lyft in the nation. TLC serves as one of the lead agencies in New York\u2019s citywide \u201cVision Zero\u201d program and promotes traffic safety through a comprehensive suite of education, outreach, enforcement, and technology promotion programs. Through these efforts, fatalities involving TLC vehicles were reduced by 50%. Meera is currently a Visiting Scholar at New York University\u2019s Rudin Center for Transportation Policy.Jascha and Meera join the accomplished members of our current policy team, Rachel Zack and Andrew Glass Hastings:Rachel Zack is a policy strategist at Remix, where she researches policy related to dockless programs, ride-hailing and autonomous vehicles. She explores how cities can work with private partners to disrupt vehicle trip generation, while also delivering on safe and more equitable mobility systems. Before joining Remix, Rachel consulted for agencies across the country (including SFCTA, MTC, TriMet, MnDOT) on strategic planning for shared mobility and autonomous vehicles. Rachel worked closely with technology companies to implement pilot programs that delivered on congestion reduction and increased transit access. Her work in the field received the Caltrans Excellence in Transportation Award in WTS Innovative Transportation Solutions Award in 2017.Andrew Glass Hastings is a senior policy strategist at Remix, and has been a leader on key transportation policies and initiatives for nearly 15 years. Previously as the Director of Transit & Mobility for the City of Seattle, Andrew and his team worked to redefine urban mobility by integrating new mobility programs and services into the broader transportation system. Prior, Andrew was the Senior Transportation Advisor to two mayors in Seattle, the Government Relations Administrator for King County Metro, and helped pass the adoption of the Sound Transit 2 Plan, which dedicated $10.8 billion for light rail in the Puget Sound region.We\u2019re excited to have such a strong team pushing for better transportation policy outcomes in our cities.

For this story, we spoke with three women \u2014 Sarah Bindman (Software Engineer), Nichole Jordan (VP of Success), and Courtney Sung (Director of Sales and Business Development) \u2014 about why they joined the team, what they\u2019re working on now, and why they\u2019re excited about the path ahead. If you\u2019re interested in joining the team, view open roles or email Tammie Vu, tammie@remix.com.Sarah BindmanWhat do you do at Remix?I\u2019m a software engineer working on our scheduling product, which helps transit agencies better plan where their buses will go and which routes their operators will drive. My team uses algorithms to figure out the most effective use of vehicles and drivers. I\u2019m currently working on presenting that information visually so customers can better understand their options and make informed decisions about trade-offs for their agency.SarahI\u2019m also the point engineer for the Antelope Valley Transit Authority (AVTA), one of our customers based in Lancaster, CA. AVTA operates a largely electric fleet. As a result, they have many unique challenges, like figuring out how to charge their vehicles and planning for midday storage. I\u2019ve been working on implementing UI enhancements so AVTA can visualize their system constraints and create a schedule they are happy with. Working directly with the agencies we\u2019re serving is one of the most rewarding parts of this job.Tell us about your background.I studied urban planning at MIT, and then worked as a transportation planner. I loved the \u201cbig picture\u201d of transportation planning, and realized I was particularly interested in data and visualizing complex information. After observing how important software is in driving decision-making processes, I decided to transition to software engineering. My new role has allowed me to continue working on issues I am passionate about, including accessibility and mobility, while allowing me to grow my skills as a software engineer.\u201cWorking directly with the agencies we\u2019re serving is one of the most rewarding parts of this job.\u201d \u2014 SarahWhy did you decide to join Remix?As someone early in their software career looking to grow and improve, I wanted an environment that would help me succeed. I was impressed by the tools and support systems the Engineering team has in place. It\u2019s very collaborative \u2014 everyone on the team is generous with their time, whether it\u2019s pair programming, whiteboarding, or just talking through a problem.Sarah and members of the team eat lunch together.I also strongly align with Remix\u2019s mission to design better cities and transportation systems. I\u2019ve always been passionate about transportation in general. Mobility is a critical social justice issue, but the U.S. has this entrenched, car-first mentality. Much of our country doesn\u2019t prioritize transit, whereas cities like Mexico City and Bogot\u00e1 have these incredible networks of trains, light rail, and buses. I think we can learn a lot from developing countries about transit as a means to give more people access to education, services, and jobs.What are you excited about in the coming year?I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how our scheduling product grows as we build it to serve the needs of existing and new customers. We\u2019re figuring out how to turn complex information and decision-making processes into an elegant, user-friendly interface.I\u2019m also excited about the quality of our products in general \u2014 they really are exceptional. We take the time to do things right. Our process is set up to continuously gather customer feedback so we can build tools that are truly intuitive and effective. I\u2019m looking forward to using the feedback we have collected from our early customers to inform future iterations of the scheduling product.Sarah pauses work for a quick chat with a fellow teammate.Nichole JordanTell us about your role at Remix.I lead our Customer Success team, which makes sure Remix customers get as much as they can out of our products, which hopefully encourages them to renew their contracts.NicholeTo me, customer success is different than customer service in that service is reactive and transactional, whereas success is more consultative. We need to be experts in Remix\u2019s products, as well as in our customers\u2019 businesses. We have to understand the challenges our customers face, and we have to know our products well enough to demonstrate how we can help our customers meet their goals. We also need to recognize the early warning signs that we are in danger of losing a customer. If a customer doesn\u2019t renew a contract, that should never be a surprise. When we can see it coming, we can often turn things around.What were you doing before Remix, and why did you join?I studied civil engineering as an undergraduate and received my MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. After that, I spent 10 years in customer service at Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). In my last role there, I had 1,000 employees reporting to me, including the frontline contact center customer service reps. I worked at a startup prior to PG&E and wanted to return to a smaller company focused on software. I went to C3 Energy \u2014 now C3 IoT \u2014 for three years, then I moved to AnyPerk \u2014 now Fond \u2014 to be their VP of Customer Success. I had the opportunity to build processes from the ground up there, and I defined what the function was going to look like.A recruiting agency reached out about Remix, and I wasn\u2019t actually looking for a job at the time. But I was intrigued because this company solves a very real problem. Given my background, I immediately saw the value of the product, and this was an exciting opportunity to get back to my civil engineering roots.The Remix team shares a laugh during their weekly all hands meeting.What do you prioritize as a leader?I try to be approachable and, most importantly, authentic. What you see is what you get. My ultimate goal is to make sure everyone on the team can be themselves and contribute their own unique strengths and talents.I also love coaching and developing people. That\u2019s especially interesting in this role, because part of what we do as a team is coach and develop the customers who use our products.\u201cWe have a lot of innovative thinking here because people come from diverse backgrounds\u2014it\u2019s a real competitive advantage.\u201d -NicholeWhat makes Remix different from other companies?I love the way we value feedback, for two reasons. One, Remix is highly customer-centric. A lot of companies think they know better than the customer, and they just push out features without collecting or incorporating feedback. Here, customer feedback is integral to how the product evolves.And two, a culture that values feedback creates trust. We can be open and honest with each other. We can just be ourselves, and that\u2019s incredibly important to me. I\u2019ve worked in organizations where everyone thought the same way \u2014 and innovation suffered. We have a lot of innovative thinking here because people come from diverse backgrounds, and we can bring those differences together in a constructive way. It\u2019s a real competitive advantage.Nichole meets with other leaders at Remix to collaborate on upcoming projects.Courtney SungWhat\u2019s your role at Remix?I\u2019m currently our Director of Sales and Business Development and lead the sales team, but I\u2019ve worn many hats since I joined the team a couple of years ago. There were only eight employees in the whole company back then! At that time we all did a little of everything \u2014 I helped create our first outbound playbook, organized our attendance at field events, and even spoke at a couple conferences. Last fall, I was asked to establish the sales process for our second product, and earlier this year I started working with enterprise accounts. I was promoted to a leadership position in September, so now my main focus is managing my team.CourtneyWhat did you do before Remix?I studied urban planning at MIT for both undergrad and my master\u2019s, and afterwards spent four years in D.C. managing business development for Chemonics, an international development consulting firm, where I helped implement federal government projects. I learned a lot about selling services and business development for the government sector, but I wanted to experience selling a tangible product that solves a specific problem. It\u2019s always been important to me to sell something I believe in. I\u2019d also been thinking about transitioning into the tech world, and then Remix reached out looking for an urban planner with business development experience. It was a product in a technical area that I was actually very keen on and also had experience in. It felt like the stars aligned.\u201cAt Remix, we practice open, direct feedback, which is different from other places I\u2019ve worked.\u201d -CourtneyWhat\u2019s the culture like on the Sales team?It\u2019s highly collaborative. In every weekly team meeting, we\u2019ll share something interesting that happened that week, so we can all learn from each other\u2019s best practices. We also encourage team members to hop on each other\u2019s calls. It\u2019s so helpful to hear how someone else negotiates, or talks about the products. Of course, we have a very collaborative relationship with our customers too. Remix is much more consultative than many other companies in the technology space.As far as the broader company culture, everyone here is incredibly smart but extremely humble. We practice open, direct feedback, which is definitely different from other places I\u2019ve worked, where it was more political. Here, it\u2019s just, \u201cHey, I want to help you improve.\u201d It can be hard at times, but it\u2019s a great way to grow.Courtney steps out to grab coffee with a few teammates.How do you think about leadership?My role as a leader is to empower our account executives to work more efficiently and effectively, and to teach them to trust their instincts. I don\u2019t like micromanaging. I\u2019ve gone through the sales process as an account executive myself, so I know the importance of autonomy and ownership. I trust my team members to do their work as they see fit and want to help them gain the skills to do so.It\u2019s also important to encourage diversity of backgrounds and diversity of thought. On my team alone, we have a former transit planner from LA Metro, a software salesperson who also worked in photography and immigration, and an account executive who studied urban planning but was a whitewater rafting guide before transitioning to software sales. We can each lead initiatives based on our respective strengths and weaknesses, so that diversity is really valuable to the team as a whole.As the day winds down, we catch Courtney bursting into laughter with a coworker.Interested in joining the Remix team?

Totalmente renovado, colaboramos com o maior portal de cultura pop do Brasil para encontrar sua nova voz, afirmar o seu prop\u00f3sito, entendendo o novo jeito de consumir informa\u00e7\u00e3o, principalmente dos 9vinhos (jovens).E a parte mais legal de todo esse processo foram as longas reuni\u00f5es com p\u00e3o de queijo \u2014 tipo uma tonelada - com Claudia Assef, DJ e diretora de conte\u00fado do Virgula, e Silvia Ruiz, diretora de projetos especiais do portal. Por isso, a gente n\u00e3o poderia deixar de compartilhar isso com voc\u00eas.D\u00e1 scroll que t\u00e1 maneiro.Remix Social Ideas: Como voc\u00eas enxergam a nova gera\u00e7\u00e3o que consome o conte\u00fado na Internet?Claudia Assef: \u00c9 uma gera\u00e7\u00e3o que, ao mesmo tempo em que consome, tamb\u00e9m cria muito na internet. De v\u00eddeos a verdadeiros f\u00f3runs de coment\u00e1rios, todo mundo tem algo a dizer. Ent\u00e3o voc\u00ea acaba tendo que competir, entre aspas, com o conte\u00fado que eles mesmos produzem \u2014 e \u00e0s vezes voc\u00ea acha coisa muito boa no meio desse bolol\u00f4. Tem coisas geniais feitas por uma molecada que n\u00e3o necessariamente mora nas grandes capitais, e \u00e9 essa uma das maravilhas da intern\u00ea. Portanto, hoje n\u00e3o existe mais aquela ideia de todo mundo vendo as mesmas coisas, consumindo os mesmos programas por falta de op\u00e7\u00e3o.Remix Social Ideas: O que Virgula pode trazer de novidade pro mundo editorial? Qual \u00e9 o principal diferencial em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos concorrentes diretos?Claudia Assef: O mais legal do nosso novo conceito editorial \u00e9 que a gente pode falar de tudo, quase que ao mesmo tempo, mas sempre com um tom muito divertido e inteligente. Quer dizer, por que ler as not\u00edcias sobre moda, famosos, esporte, cinema, TV, m\u00fasica, enfim, por que buscar tudo isso no Virgula?! Simplemente porque \u00e9 mais legal, mais divertido, mais do jeito que a gente fala, s\u00f3 que tudo isso amarrado a t\u00e9cnicas de jornalismo, o que ir\u00e1 garantir que a informa\u00e7\u00e3o foi apurada, o texto \u00e9 bem escrito e obedece a uma hierarquia de import\u00e2ncia das informa\u00e7\u00f5es assim como pede todo manual de boas pr\u00e1ticas jornal\u00edsticas. Estamos, com isso, criando uma linguagem para os tempos de informa\u00e7\u00e3o digital, ao mesclar o tom das m\u00eddias sociais como as premissas b\u00e1sicas do jornalismo tradicional.Remix Social Ideas: Hoje em dia, o monitoramento e a m\u00e9trica vem ganhando muita import\u00e2ncia. Os dados v\u00e3o direcionar o conte\u00fado? Como voc\u00eas veem a intelig\u00eancia aplicada aos dados?Claudia Assef: \u00c9 importante ficar de olho naquilo que funciona, que impacta mais as pessoas, com certeza. Mas n\u00e3o vamos deixar de fazer coisas que n\u00e3o necessariamente deem, historicamente, menos audi\u00eancia. Estamos atentas ao que o povo quer e gosta, mas tamb\u00e9m precisamos apresentar conte\u00fados que possam surpreender e aos poucos ir caindo no gosto das pessoas. N\u00e3o podemos virar escravos daquilo que clamam as redes, apenas.Remix Social Ideas: O que que o jornalismo pode aprender com a publicidade e vice versa?Silvia Ruiz: Acho que o jornalismo pode aprender a embalar melhor seu conte\u00fado, se preocupar mais com a forma tanto quanto com a ess\u00eancia e a informa\u00e7\u00e3o; Jornalistas nem sempre s\u00e3o bons nisso. Acho que a publicidade pode aprender a contar boas hist\u00f3rias e a buscar a verdade nelas. Conte\u00fado tem que ser de verdade, seja para uma marca ou para um jornal, n\u00e3o d\u00e1 para lan\u00e7ar m\u00e3o de tanta ilus\u00e3o quanto a publicidade est\u00e1 acostumada.Remix Social Ideas: Como voc\u00eas acham que devem ser feitas as parcerias entre marcas e ve\u00edculos de uma forma que seja legal para ambos e que o conte\u00fado saia ganhando?Silvia Ruiz: As marcas devem entender que o di\u00e1logo com o consumidor por meio de ve\u00edculos tem que ser com um respeito enorme \u00e0 linguagem de cada ve\u00edculo. As marcas precisam contar mais hist\u00f3rias e buscar construir conte\u00fados de verdade, produzir conte\u00fados que virem not\u00edcia e acreditar que o ve\u00edculo sabe como ningu\u00e9m como falar com seu p\u00fablico. Acho que essa confian\u00e7a torna o conte\u00fado vencedor.Continue lendo outros artigos da Remix:Word of Mouth 2014Usamos nossos poderes de M\u00e9dium (risos) para antecipar as palavras que v\u00e3o figurar nas novas edi\u00e7\u00f5es dos dicion\u00e1rios de 2015Blogueiros do s\u00e9culo passadoUma conversa com os criadores dos primeiros blogs brasileirosMillennials ensinam as marcas a usar o SnapchatConversamos com jovens brasileiros de 14 a 18 anos para compreender a rede social que passou o TwitterO efeito \u201cJack, o Estripador\u201d toma conta do universo mobilePor que Google Drive, Foursquare e Facebook est\u00e3o sendo fatiados", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Exile / Snake-Dance Remix : Training for Clarity", "post_link": "https://medium.com/training-the-mind-to-see-new-horizons/exile-snake-dance-remix-training-for-clarity-131f1d1a8dfd?source=search_post", "author_name": "Andrew Markell", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@andrewtmarkell", "publish_date": "2016-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2018-03-25", "readtime": "2.52", "claps": 11, "voters": 8, "content": "Exile / Snake-Dance Remix : Training for ClarityAndrew MarkellFollowMay 22, 2016 \u00b7 3 min readIn nature, the poison and its antidote are always in very close proximity to each other.In certain clans and tribes of the Americas, a high-level rite of passage for a healer was what was called a Snake Dance Ceremony. At the heart of the experience was a supreme test; a highly poisonous snake would bite the practitioner. From then on, either the practitioner would transmute the poison or succumb.The powerful, alarming part of the experience was that death in fact was not a possibility. Failure did not result in death. Worse, the practitioner would embody a certain kind of insanity; the heaviest kind of insanity in fact. All memory of the ceremony would disappear, and the practitioner would continue on into life with no knowledge of what had happened.The essence of the challenge is this: the practitioner finds himself in exile, with no knowledge of having arrived and only some deeper sensing that this place where the signs and symbols suddenly do not make much sense is now his home. His reality.In finding a narrative structure to best understand where we stand today as individuals and as participants in this great experiment called civilization, exile is most powerful. Exile as a narrative and framework that leads to clear understanding is superior to either the progressive narrative or the conservative \u2014 both of which confuse people into believing they recognize what is happening today.And the quicker we embrace this truth the better off we will be. Why? Because to be in exile and not know it creates the deepest and most absolute kind of disorientation in a person. Drawn by the very human need to feel some sense of security in the world, we will find explanations for things that don\u2019t stack up \u2014 no different than the way early explorers forced unknown realities and cultures into their own small frameworks. To the great and lasting detriment of both.There are, it seems, two muses: the Muse of Inspiration, who gives us inarticulate visions and desires, and the Muse of Realization, who returns again and again to say \u201cIt is yet more difficult than you thought.\u201d This is the muse of form. It may be then that form serves us best when it works as an obstruction, to baffle us and deflect our intended course. It may be that when we no longer know what to do, we have come to our real work and when we no longer know which way to go, we have begun our real journey. The mind that is not baffled is not employed. The impeded stream is the one that sings. -Wendell BerryThis is key: Turn confusion, uncertainty and anxiety into forces of high-functioning capability. Train the mind with discipline to master uncertainty as opposed to solving for it. The rest will fall into place.But first, one must take the poison in a remarkably honest way by starting from the truth that what was once held as certain is gone.All certainty has to be jettisoned. This act of courage and simple pragmatism is the only way to survive \u2014 and eventually master \u2014 the current state of exile we all find ourselves in. To fail is to remain as we are, invisibly enslaved to a compelling array of consoling illusions that bring the worst kind of comfort and conformity.If we want to create and give form to the future there is no other way in.Andrew Markell is the Co-Founder of Exile, a company that creates, advises and helps capitalize transformative companies and market ecosystems dedicated to empowering people + planet.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Creativity", "Spirituality", "Leadership"]}, {"title": "The Path To Disaster: A Startup Is Not A Small Version of A Big Company \u2014 The Office Hours Remix", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@brianlaungaoaeh/the-path-to-disaster-a-startup-is-not-a-small-version-of-a-big-company-the-office-hours-remix-67907bc31f39?source=search_post", "author_name": "Brian Laung Aoaeh, CFA", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@brianlaungaoaeh", "publish_date": "2015-11-14", "last_modified_date": "2018-03-01", "readtime": "11.4", "claps": 7, "voters": 7, "content": "The Path To Disaster: A Startup Is Not A Small Version of A Big Company \u2014 The Office Hours RemixBrian Laung Aoaeh, CFAFollowNov 14, 2015 \u00b7 12 min readWilliamsburg Waterfront PiersNote: This is a remix of The Path To Disaster: A Startup Is Not A Small Version of A Big Company, a blog post I wrote for publication at Tekedia on August 20, 2012. This remix is based on my experience meeting early stage startup founders in NYC since then.Each time I hold office hours in New York City, I encounter at least one individual who comes by to ask me a version of the question: \u201cWhere do I start?\u201dSome are first-time founders just getting started, others are in the midst of making a transition from being employed at a company to striking out to start something on their own, or with one or two other people. In every case so far I would not characterize any of the people who have asked me this question as completely clueless, in the sense that they have a network that includes many early stage investors \u2014 angels, and venture capitalists, and they know other people who are startup founders, they read numerous blogs etc. They have asked this question of others . . . . . and yet when they encounter me at office hours they say they still feel confused.I always promise that they will leave with a framework that they will always be able to use as a guide. This post outlines the conversation we have.I like to start with a few definitions, because that ensures that we are on the same page and thinking about things in the same way.Definition #1: What is a Project? A Project is an undertaking by an individual or a group of individuals in order to accomplish a specific goal.Definition #2: What is a Startup? A startup is a temporary organization built to search for the solution to a problem, and in the process to find a repeatable, scalable and profitable business model that is designed for incredibly fast growth. The defining characteristic of a startup is that of experimentation \u2014 in order to have a chance of survival every startup has to be good at performing the experiments that are necessary for the discovery of a successful business model.Definition #3: What is a Company? A company is a business organization that has been built for the specific purpose of scaling a repeatable, and scalable business model.Given those definitions, let\u2019s revisit the question I get asked by first-time founders; \u201cWhere do I start?\u201dSources of Investment: Seed, Angels and VCs by Thomas Wisniewski, via SlideShareInflection Point 1: Idea -> ProjectInitially, an individual, perhaps two or three individuals who know one another discuss an idea and feel that they may be onto something that could become big. At that point they have a project, and their goal is to determine if their idea is a big enough one to merit devoting more resources to transforming into a physical thing. This could happen while they are still in school, or perhaps while they are employed. So work on the project occurs at night, during weekends, and in whatever free time they can find. Importantly, the project is not yet a top priority. During this stage the founder or founders will be bootstrapping, spending their personal capital in order to conduct whatever research they feel they need to perform in order to make some progress.If they eventually conclude that the idea has enough merit to become a business one day, and they would like to pursue building that business, then they begin the transition from working on a project to forming a startup.Inflection Point 2: Project -> StartupOnce they make the choice to become a startup, it is most likely that the team will need to devote additional resources to their endeavor. For example; the team needs to start building a product \u2014 a minimum viable product, someone has to start thinking about how to win early customers/users, and more time has to be devoted to sorting out a number of other issues like how everything that needs to get done at this stage will be paid for.Friends & FamilyIf everything is going well so far, the founders might decide that they need some external capital. At this stage the easiest source of capital is the founders\u2019 friends and family and the amount of capital raised will generally be less than $1,000,000. This round of capital should be devoted to building a minimum viable product (MVP) and confirming the hypotheses that the founders started to examine when this undertaking was \u201cmerely\u201d a project.The key point here is that people in this group know the founders personally and are making an investment largely on the basis of their trust and belief in the founders. Often the investors in this category do not understand much about what the founders are building if the product involves a technological innovation. However, they likely believe \u201cBrit is smart and hardworking. We know she will do great. We want to support her build her dream.\u201d So while a financial return would be nice, it is not the primary motivation. Nonetheless, I advise founders to make it a habit to pitch the idea formally even to this group of potential investors because it is worth the effort to start learning to pitch other people even at that early stage.This round will probably be a convertible debt round, with terms driven by the founders.The minimum viable product is the smallest, least expensive product that can be built in order to test the most important hypothesis on which the startup\u2019s business model will depend.\u2013 Paraphrasing Teresa TorresAngel InvestorsIf things go well enough, the founders decide that they need to raise even more capital, more than they can expect to raise from their immediate social circles. There are still important questions that remain to be answered. The business model has not yet been discovered. Although early customers/users have been identified there is not yet any meaningful revenue traction. It may be a few more months before the product is mature enough to generate meaningful revenues although potential customers/users are testing the product and so far the key performance indicators (KPIs) look promising. There is still substantial work to be done on product features, but there is enough for some early customers to consider paying for.An angel round will generally be about $1,000,000 or slightly more, but generally less than $2,000,000 or so. With each angel investor typically investing an amount between $25,000 \u2014 $100,000 or so.This round will probably be a convertible debt round, whose terms will be driven by a lead angel who will do some work on behalf of the group. If the round is raised from an organized angel investor network, then the process might unfold according to the framework within which the group operates.Angels will generally have a much more sophisticated understanding of the product and the market than individuals who invested in the Friends & Family round.Seed Stage Venture CapitalistsTwo important differences between Angel Investors and Seed Stage Venture Capitalists is that Angel Investors typically do not invest on a full-time basis, and Angel Investors typically are making investments on their own behalf.If things go well, it gets to a point where the team working on the startup has key members in place, the product has advanced beyond the MVP, there is meaningful customer/user traction, and revenue is early but indicative of a significant market opportunity. The team now decides that it makes sense to raise venture capital.A seed stage venture fund will likely invest between $150,000 \u2014 $1,000,000 at a time, in financing rounds that range from $1,000,000 \u2014 $3,000,000 or so, but generally less than $5,000,000. Some funds might have requirements such as:Minimum investment size, of say $500,000.Ownership targets, of say 10%.Syndicate composition, preferring a syndicate that includes at least one or two other institutional seed-stage venture capital funds.This round will likely be a priced round, and the venture fund leading the round will set the valuation, agree to a term sheet with the startup, and negotiate the final documents that will govern that round of financing.Here are a few nuances about this segment of the startup and venture capital ecosystem.Founders should focus their efforts on finding and speaking with funds that have a current fund size that fits the size of the round the founders are trying to raise. What does that mean? A seed stage VC investing a $50,000,000 fund will likely set a minimum investment size of $500,000 or more as an internal rule of thumb. I would not spend my time pursuing a meeting with this VC if I were a founder raising a $750,000 round, for example. Why? Minimum investment size and syndicate composition would likely pose stumbling blocks. On the other hand, a seed stage VC investing from a $10,000,000 fund might be worth the time and effort I put into getting a meeting because such a fund has likely set a minimum investment amount that is less than $500,000 \u2014 say, $350,000, and may also be willing to invest as part of a syndicate that is largely filled by angels. So my $750,000 round could be filled as follows: $350,000 from a lead investor (institutional VC #1), $200,000 from another VC (institutional VC #2), $100,000 from an angel investor (angel investor #1), $50,000 from another angel investor (angel investor #2) and the remainder in $25,000 increments (from angel investors #3 and #4)I do not advocate completely ignoring investment professionals at larger seed-stage funds. Let\u2019s go back to the example of a founder raising $750,000. Assume that angel investor #4 is friends with a VC at a $120,000,000 seed stage fund and offers to make an introduction because \u201d . . . this is the sort of stuff they love to invest in . . . \u201d Then that meeting is very much worth taking because it enables the founder to start building a relationship with that VC and determine if there\u2019s an investment and personality fit, and it enables the VC to observe the progress the startup is making over time and to get a more intimate sense of the founders\u2019 management decision-making skills. This matters because this VC could be a potential investor in a subsequent \u201cInstitutional Seed Round\u201d in which the startup is raising $2,500,000 for example.Inflection Point 3: Startup -> CompanyIf things are going well, our startup gets to the point where it now wants to raise more than $5,000,000 because the founders believe they have:Confirmed their primary hypotheses,Understand how to win customers/users, and how to generate revenues and profits,Need more capital to pursue sales, andHire more people.This organization is still a startup, but it has started the slow transition from being a startup to becoming a company. This transition will depend to a large extent on how successful the startup is at creating and satisfying demand for its product. This transition will probably traverse several rounds. Generally I think of Series A, B, C and D as covering the period during which a startup is building out the internal and external structures that help it become a company. How do you know a startup has become a company. Well, it starts resembling organizations to which we are often accustomed. The existence of a full complement of c-suite executives is one good indicator.Ultimately we get to a point where, the search and discovery stage has receded far into the past, and the structures of a company have been built. All that is then left is for the company to grow by executing and scaling the business model, and generating profits.In Sam Altman\u2019s article \u201cProjects and Companies\u201d he points out that the distinction is important mainly because of how it affects the way founders behave and think about what they are doing. The underlying feature of the transition from an idea to a company is that founders should be in a learning, experimentation, and discovery mode.Distinctions matter. There is an important difference between a startup and a company.In a company customers are already known, the product features that matter to these customers is already known, how much they will pay for the new product or service has already been established, and the market opportunity has already been sized and is well understood. In a company the business model is already known, and most activities are designed to execute a detailed business plan.In contrast, a startup begins with no customers, no real understanding of the features customers need, no idea what customers will be willing to pay for the product, and no knowledge of the business model that will be most suited to creating, delivering and extracting value.Steve Blank and Bob Dorf describe The 9 Deadly Sins of The New Product Introduction Model in their book The Startup Owner\u2019s Manual. These are the lessons they offer startup founders who are in the search and discover phase.Don\u2019t assume you know what the customer wants \u2014 start with guesses and hypotheses. These become facts only after they have been validated with customers willing to pay for the product.Don\u2019t assume you know what features to build \u2014 this follows directly from the preceding lesson, avoid building features no body cares about by first testing your assumptions about them with customers willing to pay for them.Don\u2019t focus on a launch date \u2014 instead focus on building a product that customers want to pay to use. Focusing on a launch date can cause the team to place an emphasis on the wrong things, causing the startup to hurtle towards the launch date even if it does not yet know its customers, or how to educate them about its product. Also, this becomes a milestone by which the startup\u2019s investors will judge the performance of their investment.Don\u2019t emphasize execution. Rather emphasize developing and testing hypotheses, learning, and iteration \u2014 the emphasis on getting things done at a startup can lead employees to focus on execution rather than searching for answers to the guesses that the startup is operating under. Hypotheses have to be tested, and tested again. Executing on untested hypotheses is a \u201cgoing-out-of-business strategy.\u201dDon\u2019t focus on a business plan, instead search for a business model \u2014 A business plan offers the great comfort of presumed certainty. The reality of a startup\u2019s existence is one of acute uncertainty. That can be very unsettling. A startup\u2019s founders, investors, employees, and board of directors must avoid the seduction that accompanies reliance on business plans, and the management tools that characterize the experience of large companies with known customers and well-established business models. Results of experimentation and validation tests should matter more than milestones.Don\u2019t confuse traditional job titles with what a startup needs to accomplish \u2014 the traits that an individual needs in order to succeed in the environment of a startup differ significantly from those that lead to success in a large company with a known business model, a fixed business plan, known customers, and a known market. In contrast, to succeed in the startup environment an individual needs to be comfortable with chaos, flux, and \u201coperating without a map\u201d. The worst thing that could happen for a startup is for employees to default to behaving as they would if they were working in a large company.Do not execute a \u201cSales and Marketing\u201d plan too early \u2014 sales and marketing can become too focused on executing to a seemingly great plan rather than learning the identity of a startup\u2019s most profitable customers and gaining knowledge about what will spur those customers to engage in behavior that enables the startup generate revenues and profits. Consider a scenario in which a startup has gained hundreds of customers but only a tiny fraction of those customers actually make a purchase, and to make things worse a vast majority of completed purchases are made by a an even smaller number of repeat buyers. A focus on the \u201cnumber of customers\u201d might camouflage the startup\u2019s dire need to determine what steps it needs to take in order to dramatically increase the number of paying customers.Don\u2019t presume success prematurely \u2014 executing to a business plan often leads to premature scaling, even when the reality might call for the startup to hit the brakes. Expanding overhead costs before the revenue to support such costs materializes is the shortest path to disaster for a startup. Hiring, and infrastructure expansion should only happen after sales and marketing have become predictable, repeatable, and scalable processes. Moreover, startups need to be impatient for profits but patient for growth. A startup that know\u2019s how to earn a profit can survive indefinitely. A startup that does not know how to earn a profit, but instead is focused on other measures of growth is playing a dangerous game of Russian roulette.Don\u2019t manage by crises, that leads to a death spiral \u2014 the accumulation of all these mistakes leads to the inevitable demise of the startup that makes the mistake of operating as if it is merely a small version of a big company.For those potential first-time founders who are grappling with the question: \u201cWhere do I start?\u201d . . . I hope this helps.Next?

I considered the artificial intelligence \u201cstars\u201d of pop culture- Apple\u2019s Siri, 2001 A Space Odyssey\u2019s HAL,Bladerunner\u2019s Rachael and Samantha from Spike Jonze\u2019s poignant film Her.I\u2019ve long been fascinated by how machines \u201clearn\u201d and what are the differences between machine learning and human learning. Think about your predictive text on your smartphone\u2026mine has sure learned a lot about my linguistic tendencies (sometimes to my embarrassment). How does it work?\u201cThis learning adapts, by way of the device memory, to a user\u2019s disambiguating feedback that results in corrective key presses\u201d \u2026This great Wired article discusses \u201cDeep Learning\u201d and the differences between learning by observations versus learning by instruction. Warning: it\u2019s a mind boggler. It even goes into touching upon The Internet of Things:\u201cThe idea of associating an intelligent assistant with a single device is also already a thing of the past; instead, our assistants are already manifesting themselves through a variety of hardware that we utilize throughout the day. The same persona, with a consistent and constantly updated knowledge of our needs and interests, and a memory of all our interactions, transcends specific hardware, and be with us as we move between using our wearables, tablets, TVs, and cars.\u201dWhen I taught Theory of Knowledge in an International Baccalaureate school, we discussed what the IB defines as \u201cWays of Knowing\u201d \u2014 that is, how do we come to know things? In the period in which I was teaching, these ways expanded from four (Sense Perception, Emotion, Reason, and Language) to eight (adding Intuition, Faith, Memory, and \u2014 my favourite \u2014 Imagination).Great, all\u2026but is this \u201clearning\u201d?Knowing, I think, is not necessarily \u201clearning\u201d.For too many years \u201clearning\u201d, as it has been viewed in the education system, has been synonymous with \u201cprecise regurgitation\u201d. For some time now many schools have moved beyond that, with more \u201cperformance-based\u201d assessments of learninglike projects, challenges, and of course portfolios (both types: showcase and growth). That\u2019s fabulous, and I totally believe in it, but I think there has to be something more.Think of a skateboarder.How does he learn a new trick? He finds out about it (usually by observing another, cooler boarder), then tries to emulate. It usually doesn\u2019t happen with the first try \u2014 indeed, he must practice hours and hours (not to get all Malcolm Gladwell on the situation but there is an undeniable benefit to a certain amount of practice). The lovely thing about skateboarders, by the way, is that they tend to have an intrinsic desire to improve and work at their sport \u2014 we could all take a lesson about personal learning paths from them. They are internally motivated, even in the face of physical pain, to learn!Let\u2019s say he perfects it and can replicate it exactly. Yes, we can say he has \u201clearned it\u201d\u2026he has memorized the technique, gone through the motions enough time tointernalize it (perhaps even with some \u201cmuscle memory\u201d), and understands whenthe move should be employed (for example, on this surface but not that one). (side note: I often think of Digital Fluency this way- not only knowing HOW to use the tools but WHEN to use WHAT tool and WHY)But wait \u2014 what happens next?! Did he just riff on that move? Skateboarding is a lot like jazz in that way. \u201cPlayers\u201d learn from each other in a highly social setting, they respond to what the environment throws at them (think empty pool!), and adapt as necessary. Moreover,they seek constant innovation.Skaters see value in changing it up, in developing something new. This, I think, is the crux of learning. The ability to change, remix, distort, embellish, improve upon, tweak \u2014 whatever you wish to call it.Learning is Creativity. Creativity is Remix.I\u2019ve been, for the past few years, engrossed in the study (and practice!) of Creativity and how it works. The essence of creativity, in my opinion, is remix. Connecting disparate dots\u2026recombination to formulate something new. And there you have it \u2014 in my viewyou haven\u2019t learned until you can remix.If you can, like the skateboarder, demonstrate an understanding of the nuances of an existing piece of knowledge\u2026so much that you can in fact remix it and fashion it into something novel, then you have indeed learned it.I found a quote recently which perfectly suits this:\u201cThat is what learning is. You suddenly understand something you\u2019ve understood all your life, but in a new way\u201d \u2014 Doris LessigHow do we offer students the chance to not only encounter, memorize, reiterate, and even perform \u201cknowledge\u201d, but to trulyuse new knowledge in unique ways?As educators, weshould be constantly embedding opportunities for students to create and remix \u2014 to becometrue innovators in their own right.

Turteal on December 12, 2019 during opening remarks at the State of the Union Address sponsored by Nonserto.First off, grateful to POTUS and Congress that this historic referendum could be implemented by an industry consortium of concerned employers, endorsed by voters and media last month during our general election on November 5th, and overwhelmingly supported by the public. Thereby preventing what would\u2019ve otherwise certainly been a major economic disaster to have the Federal government fund the previous unfounded notion of providing a Universal Basic Income.At age of majority, young adults must now choose among three tracks: college, vocational, or consumer school. Subsequent military service may be combined with any one of those tracks for additional benefits, given an honorable discharge. As an aside by Turteal, there\u2019s a personal hope that university admission rates can be reduced dramatically.2019\u201312\u201312Let\u2019s unpack this: think of how much a company such as Coca-Cola must invest for development and broadcast of an advertisement during a major event, e.g., the Superbowl. Or the national conventions during Presidential election years. Aggregate those staggering advertising costs across the Global 1000, plus their lobbying investments, their PR expenditures, PAC/voter constituency budgets, adding the costs of their shareholder relations. Even with a 65% buy-in across the base of companies in category, how much Guaranteed Basic Income could that aggregate of annual operating expenses serve to finance?Tens of millions of citizens, funded for the rest of their lives. Consider that current unemployment levels in the US is quantified at less than 9.5 million. If the top 500 companies in North America created a pool, they could fund nearly 20 million consumers plus their families for less than $400 billion per year, after factoring out the illegals. While that price tag may seem staggering to some, consider the upside: a pool of firms could directly manipulate nearly 20% of the US population.A large portion of the required funding for this program will of course be channeled through reinsurance buy-back, since rates subsequent to implementation will drop substantially for a vast majority of public ills. Low-hanging fruit, ranked roughly in order of annualized costs:hospitalization subsidiesunionization (and resistance against Automation Economy in general)company costs of unemployment filingscommuting during peak hourscrime levels encroaching on wealthy urban neighborhoodsconsumer litigation (liability insurance)product backlash in social mediahomelessness removal during major sports events or tech conferencesThis becomes a kind of \u201cNew Deal\u201d, and a renegotiated Bill of Rights specifically for consumers, optimized for corporate interests and major political parties who have endeavored to provide the funding, to make the pie higher for all. This is in our wheelhouse.In practice, AIs will orchestrate crowdsourcing for consumer demand, to offset costs of peak usage for food, utilities, transportation, etc.Supporting contract law for the new program is based on a nascent legal theory of conscripted empathy.Case Study: suppose someone dies in Atlanta due to E.

But as this model falls apart, another far more resilient model is taking shape: walkable, dense, diverse, compact \u2014 and urban.The storm\u2019s disruptive power is real. The core market for suburban single-family houses \u2014 families with kids \u2014 represents roughly half the share of North America\u2019s population that it did in 1970.

Meanwhile, younger, educated workers are moving into urban cores, and knowledge industry office demand and investment are following. (Downtowns and dense, walkable suburbs fill Amazon\u2019s list of finalists for HQ2.)Unsurprisingly, suburban housing and office values have lagged their urban counterparts since 2000. And, in a dramatic reversal, more people living in poverty now call suburbs home, while affluent households are relocating to cities. This has slowed tax-base growth, battering local budgets. Demographic and economic trends suggest that these dynamics will grow more disruptive over the next two decades \u2014 reinforced by the arrival of shared autonomous mobility (see sidebar below).On the green fringes of Washington, D.C., Fairfax County, Virginia \u2014 long an archetype of affluent, prosperous suburbia dominated by single-family subdivisions \u2014 demonstrates the stresses these trends have unleashed. Since the Great Recession, poverty across the county has grown by more than 50 percent; county revenues have not kept pace with the accompanying costs; and residents have watched as housing values have risen 300 percent faster in nearby Washington.Diverse LessonsYet Fairfax County is anything but broken. Spurred by the region\u2019s Metrorail transit system, Fairfax has emerged as an early leader in replacing sprawl with a new urban growth model. Over the past decade, the county has approved more than $20 billion in higher-density, walkable, mixed-use centers that replace millions of square feet of malls, strip retail centers, and office parks. More important, places like Tysons, Reston Town Center, and the Mosaic District aren\u2019t emerging as \u201cdevelopments\u201d but as lively new suburban downtowns and Main Streets that function as the heart of their increasingly diverse communities. Similar transformations are underway in other D.C. suburbs, such as Arlington County, Virginia, and Bethesda, Maryland.Indeed, suburbs across North America are following suit \u2014 even without transit as a catalyst. Consider Dublin, Ohio, on the outskirts of Columbus. Dublin\u2019s leaders worried that its expensive subdivisions and prize-winning golf courses had not stopped high-wage knowledge workers \u2014 along with jobs and investment \u2014 from heading to more urban settings. So the town launched a two-year planning process to create a new mixed-use, walkable downtown that would eventually grow to 10 million square feet (929,000 sq m). Developer Crawford Hoying took a financial risk with the first phase, Bridge Park, by sandwiching innovative \u201ccool office space\u201d between shops and lofts. The concept has been so successful in attracting startups and entrepreneurs back to suburbia that Crawford Hoying will build even more as they expand Bridge Park.To create a more dynamic live/work quality and attract startups and creative businesses to Dublin, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus, developer Crawford Hoying introduced \u201cabove the store\u201d workspace topped by three floors of housing. (Rendering: Crawford Hoying)Elected officials in Sandy Springs, Georgia, took a political risk that paid off in this conservative Atlanta suburb, once profiled in the New York Timesfor privatizing government services. The mayor and city council used eminent domain \u2014 not without controversy \u2014 to help create a downtown, City Springs, where none had existed and ensure that it would include a lively mix of civic and cultural activities and a critical mass of housing and office development.While Dublin and Sandy Springs represent examples of de novo downtowns in postwar suburbs, the Northland Company took an infill approach. In the mature Boston suburb of Newton, Northland is redeveloping a smaller strip center along a commercial corridor, transforming it into a new \u201cvillage center\u201d serving nearby 19th- and early-20th-century neighborhoods. The project preserves an 1860s mill building by adapting it as state-of-the-art office space \u2014 across from 21st-century lofts and caf\u00e9s.Following decades of outward expansion on the fringes of Kansas City, Overland Park, Kansas, established a vision plan and regulations, guided by extensive community engagement, that promise a more walkable and livable community focused on mixed-use nodes and higher densities. The city\u2019s downtown has emerged as a central gathering place built around a growing and diverse residential population, a mix of uses \u2014 and, unexpectedly, a lively food scene. Home to a culinary center, specialty food shops, and an array of local dining options, Overland Park\u2019s emergence as a more walkable suburb builds on emphasizing authenticity and creating a true heart for the community.In contrast to these examples drawn from relatively affluent suburbs, Miami Township, south of Dayton, Ohio, represents a middle-income suburb in a region hit hard by factory closings. Seeking to jump-start economic growth, the township created a plan to retrofit a vast area of car-focused development around the Dayton Mall. It has launched the redevelopment of 1,000 acres (405 ha) of excess surface parking and outmoded retail and office buildings into a lively mixed-use Main Street known as Miami Crossing. Sears Holdings became one of the first landowners to express interest in redeveloping land it owns at the mall.And in Canada, the province of Ontario is several steps ahead of all these communities. In 2005, it adopted the first Places to Grow Act, which sets density targets for residents and jobs in multiple urban growth centers. In response, Greater Toronto Area suburbs like Cornell and Mount Pleasant Village have created higher-density, mixed-use developments reminiscent of traditional, walkable urban neighborhoods that line streets with an animated mix of uses.This former parking garage on the edge of Belmar, in suburban Denver, was retrofitted with artists\u2019 galleries to animate a street that now links hundreds of new lofts built in response to the community\u2019s lively mix of retail and office space and an \u201cedgy\u201d vibe. (photo: Clark Reader/The Lakewood Sentinel)Common DNAWhile each of these suburbs offers unique lessons, they share a common DNA of process, policies, and placemaking. Each started with civic leadership \u2014 a local official, advocate, or organization that stepped forward and made the case for change. Each community launched a transformative planning process built around inclusive engagement that used education to build strong local support in places where terms like \u201cdense\u201d and \u201curban\u201d had long been anathema. All market-driven, these initiatives also rely on innovative public/private partnerships to fund an \u201curban\u201d infrastructure of streets, parks, and structured parking. They grow upward, not outward, creating a compact critical mass that supports the people (and disposable income) essential to bringing life to their new streets \u2014 without touching a single blade of grass on nearby residential lawns.These examples also embody shared placemaking principles. Above all, they are walkable \u2014 distinguished by lively sidewalks and animated by a wide variety of shops, food, entertainment, and other amenities that invite meandering. They connect to their communities in multiple ways: by bike, on foot, by bus (and sometimes transit), and, of course, by car \u2014 they\u2019re suburbs, after all. They feature a multilayered public realm, from \u201cactive\u201d squares to places of quiet reflection, and they often include a \u201ctown green\u201d and other civic spaces that invite their increasingly diverse populations to come together. They offer a plethora of choices for living, working, shopping, and playing, geared to increasingly diverse lifestyles. And they remind us what the overused term authentic means \u2014 not a mimicking of historic forms, but an expression of the living cultures and the history, climate, and ecology that distinguish their communities.Suburbs are in transition. A perfect storm of accelerating demographic, economic, social, and technological changes has produced unfamiliar challenges. But these are challenges to sprawl, not suburbs. Qualities that began reviving cities 20 years ago \u2014 walkable density, placemaking that builds a sense of community, a mix of uses geared to a diverse population \u2014 are bringing new life to North America\u2019s suburbs. As we enter an urban era, expect it to be as much about suburbs as it is about cities.\u2014Jason Beske, AICP, is an urban planner and urban designer with public and private experience and a frequent speaker and instructor at planning conferences.

Also for the end CW for racist language, death/rape threats and terribleness.Before we get to the good stuff I want to make a few things crystal clear. For our purposes here, everything you see in quotation marks are actual literal things that have been said in public to or about me.In my previous post I was not actually angry. Some of the dismissals of my entire point were based on my tone (hooray for tone policing), were based entirely on me being an \u201cangry Black woman\u201d and subsequently I have been deemed too mean and too much of a \u201cdiscredit\u201d to Black people that I cannot be listened to or taken seriously.Those engaging in this particular behavior are gas lighting and cherry picking. Both of those things are being used to undermine my credibility, humanity and the value of my work. They are also being used so a good number of White women can then turn what was a generalized statement into a personal one, tell others that they feel victimized and subsequently dismiss everything I said.That my friend is a textbook example of White Women Tears. Using emotional manipulation to silence the voice of a Black woman in this case, in order to a.) hang onto that White Privilege, b.) have a \u201creason\u201d to ignore what is a serious issue and c.) demonstrate an incredible lack of understanding that discourse requires that one is not always speaking or the center of attention.In stark contrast, many of you all, (we will get to know each other I promise) had a moment where you got upset and then thought, OH NO I CANNOT BELIEVE I WAS DOING THAT IT IS AWFUL.There was sadness, regret. Some of you contacted me personally to apologize and let me know that you are willing to face up that ingrained racism and work on it.That is freaking great. That is why I have spent so many years (going on 20) learning how to break this stuff down in ways that are understandable for everyone from the academic to the not up on social justice language or concepts folks. It matters that deeply to me.Hold on-The other day I wrote this whole big thing and I was going to give the people who deny my humanity but I don\u2019t want to do that. It felt too awful to sustain the hurt and anger.Dealing with having to prove that I, the big Scary, mean old Black lady have feelings and am a full real human being who, after being alive for 39 years has developed some hard boundaries when it comes to racism, is just exhausting. It hurts me.Let\u2019s not do that.Instead, I want to leave y\u2019all with the first set of tools to start really digging in and unlearning a lot of stuff that is hurtful to your own lives, my life, the lives of other POC and every Feminist in the world.So thing number one that will go a long way towards starting to mend the rift:Don\u2019t dehumanize a Black woman. That means don\u2019t tone police, don\u2019t wait until someone who is also White \u201ctranslates\u201d and all of a sudden you get it, but feel the need to point out that \u201cthe writer\u201d was too \u201charsh\u201d.Be mindful of how you talk about Black women. If all I am to you is either a Sassy Mammy or a nameless bully who says things you don\u2019t like, I am not for you and you are upholding white supremacy. So don\u2019t.Level up?When you see that kind of thing (and believe me, once you see it, it can\u2019t be unseen) speak up. Say the author (and use folks names, I have a name it is Shannon Barber) tell people that they are dehumanizing, gas lighting or otherwise being buttholes. Yes, that is great. When someone tells you that your (White person) explanation is ever so much kinder and better, tell them no.So let\u2019s start there. Work up to confronting people by showing support, show folks like me that you realize what is going on and you are with us in the struggle.I really hope that I have given you some new tools to help bolster your gumption to make some changes in how feminist discourse is done.Now remember. I don\u2019t hate you. I don\u2019t hate feminism. I hate the culturally normative and deeply harmful juggernaut of Whiteness and I want us all to do better so we can really change the world. It won\u2019t always feel like a nice bum rub and a hug because learning is hard. Understanding and changing our behaviors is hard, but I believe you can do it.###I added this note to the previous reprint and the rule stands:A note added 5/18/2016. I will not abide fuckery on this post. If you want to yell about what a racist, I am, please be so kind as to write your own article not as a comment to this one.For a little more context as to why I might say that, I did some email splelunking to show you some things that were said about and to me:All names redacted the following come from a very popular feminist page on facebook. There were more but the most racist comments were deleted and one of the mods was thoughtful enough to contact me when some folks tried to tag me into the conversation.These are the kind of comments that make me write these things over and over:When you rudely tell other women to shut up, we\u2019re going to tune you out and consider you a bitch. There\u2019s no need to be so hostile towards us just because we\u2019re white. Ugh.Angry Black woman tone policing check. Another from the same person after someone talked to them about it:Because telling someone to shut up, even when it\u2019s followed by \u2018for five minutes\u2019 is both rude and dismissive. That\u2019s how it\u2019s hostile. And being white hasn\u2019t given many of us great advantages. You shouldn\u2019t assume that it does, and that we\u2019re \u2018talking over you\u2019 when in fact, we are merely speaking.It devolved from there.Comment from a Non Black POC, zero solidarity up in there:I understand that. The writer has a lot of anger in her. From people telling her to shut up. The fact that so many of you had to explain what she was trying to say speaks volumes. Her message isn\u2019t getting across bc of her anger. Reading through the comments I\u2019m able to understand more of why she is so angry. But the action words used \u201cshut up\u201d can be misconstrued. If someone constantly tells me to shut up I\u2019m not going to reply to them with \u201cno you shut up!\u201d It\u2019s counter productive and no one wants to listen at that point.Obviously, I\u2019m the problem.Next, a lesson from a White man:If we learn nothing else from this post, let it be that leading with the words \u201cShut the hell up for five minutes\u201d is not the best way to appeal to the best in people on a topic that inspires great emotion. As for myself, the article consists of so many divisional terms like \u201cwhite ladies,\u201d \u201cwhite women,\u201d \u201cWOC,\u201d and \u201call men\u201d to make it painful to read. No one person, regardless of her skin color, should presume to be able to speak for all others of similar description or give advice to whole other groups as though they are all exactly the same in every way.So, obviously my life experience and terrible words were\u2026what?Another one, lowThis is offensive. I\u2019m tired of my favorite feminist pages putting me down because of the color of my skin. Yes, I\u2019m white. Yes, I understand privilege and work hard to fight discrimination and be the best feminist I can be. So please stop making white women the enemy. People have turned the very act of recognizing privilege into an excuse to put down white women. Yet another feminist page I will be unsubscribing from. Feminism is supposed to eradicate divisions, not create them. Seriously offensive bullshit. Sounds like an excuse to discriminate.And another one from another offended White lady:I read the article and I still don\u2019t understand, it seems an insy wincy bit racist unsure :( Because we\u2019re white we don\u2019t think about anyone but ourselves? We don\u2019t read the constant reports of rape and murder in India and the countless cases of FGM and feel outraged because we\u2019re white? She doesn\u2019t mention anywhere what the exact problems that black women face that do not affect white women, but if we\u2019re going to stop it, isn\u2019t it better to have more people on your side rather than shutting them out? What is whiteness anyway? Or maybe you could blacksplain your black lady tears while you\u2019re having a go at us? To be honest, the only feeling I\u2019m left with is the same as when feminists get hostile towards men instead of educating them, making them not want to know or care about feminist issues unsure :(Those were public.Privately here are some gems. CW this is going to be gross and racist. I\u2019m not censoring these I am slightly rewording a couple due to spelling/syntax things.Fourteen messages from facebook the next day that simply either referred to the piece by name or just said something like: fuck you racist.Next some other gems from facebook messages:You are the reason why feminism is never going to win. You are worse than any man and I will never shut up and you will never win.Next this eloquent take down:fucking nigger bitchThat one was also from a White woman who publicly on her fb page was sooooo not racist.I count a total of 32 messages calling me some variation of nigger bitch. Split let\u2019s say 60/40 White men to White women.I was told that I personally am the reason someone has flounced from feminism in about 15 messages.From my email archive what I can find related to the publication of this piece and the previous one. A dozen straight up actual death threats (generally I should/will kill you and cunts like you type), about the same number of rape threats/wishes I should be correctively raped. Called a racist, a reverse racist, a large number of times.I don\u2019t share these to shock people. I want to make a very clear point here. This is what I risk when I am Black and have opinions on the internet. I don\u2019t strictly identify as a woman, but am generally seen as a woman which is fine.This type of reaction has followed me from being a budding online diarist talking about sex and my dreams (yes, literally an online personal journal) to now being an essayist, occasional memorist and all round writer type.And I don\u2019t experience half of what friends of mine do because I have published less work about Feminism and Whiteness than I have in the past. Not because I have nothing to say but, I just don\u2019t have the emotional bandwidth to deal with the commentary.So, if you made it this far thank you. And please, think about the cost to people like me who take the risks to write this stuff.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Racism", "Feminism", "Anti Blackness"]}, {"title": "Michael Jackson, DJ Aoki e o remix \u2018\u2018Thriller da meia-noite\u2019\u2019", "post_link": "https://mjbeats.com.br/michael-jackson-dj-aoki-e-o-remix-thriller-da-meia-noite-64a063e34051?source=search_post", "author_name": "MJ Beats", "author_link": "https://mjbeats.com.br/@mjBeats", "publish_date": "2017-10-06", "last_modified_date": "2017-10-21", "readtime": "0.85", "claps": 5, "voters": 3, "content": "Michael Jackson, DJ Aoki e o remix \u2018\u2018Thriller da meia-noite\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Trabalhar neste remix foi absolutamente uma das experi\u00eancias mais memor\u00e1veis da minha vida.\u2019\u2019MJ BeatsFollowOct 6, 2017 \u00b7 1 min readAp\u00f3s divulgar o remix \u201cBlood on the Dance Floor x Dangerous\u201d, produzido pela dupla de remixes The White Panda o Esp\u00f3lio disponibilizou o remix do cl\u00e1ssico Thriller produzido pelo poderoso DJ Steve Aoki.\u201cEra arrepiante ouvir a voz de MJ, t\u00e3o viva e t\u00e3o presente ainda como um fantasma na sala.

La d\u00e9termination est une approche qui consiste \u00e0 fixer un objectif ainsi qu\u2019une strat\u00e9gie de moyens qui passe par la volont\u00e9, le d\u00e9passement de soi, la pers\u00e9v\u00e9rance et une organisation s\u00e9rieuse en vue de lever l\u2019ensemble des obstacles entre soi et l\u2019objectif que l\u2019on d\u00e9sire atteindre.La d\u00e9termination est un concept chaudSi d\u00e9finir la d\u00e9termination permet de savoir comment la penser, dans la pratique il s\u2019agit d\u2019une approche vivante qui, selon les personnes et les situations, fonctionne en compl\u00e9ment de valeurs et de convictions.Sens et D\u00e9terminationEn regardant la communaut\u00e9, je me rappelle chaque jour exactement pourquoi avec Hanane, nous avons cr\u00e9\u00e9 le Remix. Et \u00e7a c\u2019est le plus beau des moteurs. Il faut toujours revenir au pourquoi, au sens.Pas toujours simple quand on est pris dans notre quotidien mais pourtant n\u00e9cessaire. Laissez passer l\u2019urgence, prenez du recul, regardez tout le monde s\u2019exciter et demandez-vous \u201cAttends, qu\u2019est-ce que je fais l\u00e0 ? Pourquoi ?\u201dLe sens est probablement le moteur le plus puissant de la d\u00e9termination.Chance et determinationVous avez remarqu\u00e9 ? Quand on baisse les bras, il n\u2019y a en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral plus rien de bien qui arrive. Hasard, fatalit\u00e9, cercle vicieux ? Je ne pense pas. Au contraire, il faut toujours garder le bras lev\u00e9 car il y a, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, un flux ininterrompu d\u2019opportunit\u00e9s qui passe au-dessus de nos t\u00eates.La chance unique est un mythe. On peut en louper une, puis une deuxi\u00e8me mais on attrapera la 3\u00e8me pour peu que l\u2019on reste d\u00e9termin\u00e9. Et c\u2019est \u00e7a la chance. La d\u00e9termination c\u2019est cr\u00e9er sa chance !Comme disait Einstein \u00ab Je pense et je pense encore pendant plusieurs mois, pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es, 99 fois que ma conclusion est fausse, la 100\u00e8me c\u2019est la bonne\u201d.Responsabilit\u00e9 Ethique et D\u00e9terminationPeu ais\u00e9 il y\u2019a 10 ans, on peut d\u00e9sormais affirmer qui nous sommes, dans toute notre complexit\u00e9, notre vision et nos valeurs.Il est de notre responsabilit\u00e9 de choisir notre \u00e9thique, de casser ou d\u2019imposer certaines r\u00e8gles.Car plus vous serez en accord avec vous-m\u00eames, plus cela viendra renforcer votre d\u00e9termination.L\u2019ObstinationOn peut s\u2019apercevoir en cours de projet que l\u2019on va dans une direction qui n\u2019est pas la bonne. Alors on modifie son plan, c\u2019est ce que l\u2019on appelle un pivot. Si le faire trop souvent est le signe d\u2019une vision un peu fragile, ne pas le faire du tout est le signe de l\u2019obstination. Et l\u2019obstination, c\u2019est la d\u00e9connexion de notre vision avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de notre projet. Sur le court-moyen-terme, l\u2019obstination est donc notre perte !Bonheur et D\u00e9terminationPourquoi ne pas int\u00e9grer le bonheur dans la d\u00e9termination ? Comme le dit Steve Jobs : \u201cLe chemin c\u2019est d\u00e9j\u00e0 l\u2019accomplissement\u201d. Alors pourquoi ne pas se cr\u00e9er un chemin de vie ou chaque jour en rentrant, on peut se dire \u201cvoil\u00e0 ce que j\u2019ai accompli\u201d. Avec Hanane, mon associ\u00e9e, nous appelons cela des petites victoires.Et les petites victoires, il faut les c\u00e9l\u00e9brer. Si on attend la victoire ultime, celle qui est tout au bout du chemin, on risque d\u2019attendre tr\u00e8s longtemps, parfois ind\u00e9finiment et d\u2019ailleurs, comme le soulignait l\u2019\u00e9conomiste Keynes : \u00ab \u00c0 long-terme, nous serons tous morts ! \u00bb.Savourez donc vos petites victoires afin d\u2019entretenir votre d\u00e9termination tout en vous offrant l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 d\u2019appr\u00e9cier authentiquement chaque jour qui passe.Le regard socialPendant que nous nous lancions dans notre aventure entrepreneuriale, nous avions des amis dont la carri\u00e8re d\u00e9collait et qui nous regardaient avec condescendance en nous disant (je caricature un peu, pas trop) : \u00ab C\u2019est super ce que vous faites les amis, quel courage. Au fait, pas trop dur de manger des p\u00e2tes depuis 2 ans ? \u00bbPas facile, car le regard social rajoute une couche de pression, et fonctionne comme un effet miroir sur la th\u00e9matique de l\u2019\u00e9chec. Depuis, certains de ces amis, se sont lanc\u00e9s \u00e0 leur tour dans l\u2019entrepreneuriat, d\u2019autres viennent nous demander conseil, et tout cela fait que nous nous sentons beaucoup plus l\u00e9gitimes qu\u2019\u00e0 nos d\u00e9but.La cl\u00e9 de d\u00e9termination que je partage avec vous, c\u2019est la foi, la foi en votre vision. Tenez bon, vous vous sentirez seuls un bon moment avant de vous sentir bien avec vous et avec les autres.Quelques mots sur le Remix CoworkingRemix est une histoire de d\u00e9termination.Au tout d\u00e9but, on nous disait : \u201cpersonne n\u2019est rentable et ce secteur des espaces de coworking, c\u2019est un truc de hippies\u201d.Mais nous avions la foi car nous \u00e9tions persuad\u00e9s que le monde avait durablement chang\u00e9 et que l\u2019on allait passer \u00e0 une \u00e8re o\u00f9 tous les rapports entre les gens seraient diff\u00e9rents, o\u00f9 la vision et les valeurs seraient mises en avant, o\u00f9 l\u2019horizontalit\u00e9 serait la nouvelle r\u00e8gle.Pour trouver notre force int\u00e9rieure (et aussi un mod\u00e8le \u00e9conomique), nous avons d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de voyager, afin d\u2019observer, confronter nos perceptions et constater que nos r\u00e9flexions \u00e9taient partag\u00e9s dans le monde entier. Ensuite \u00e0 nous de nous inspirer pour faire de Remix une communaut\u00e9 unique, un game changer !La cl\u00e9 de d\u00e9termination est ici : ALLEZ VOYAGER !Nous avons \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Detroit, une ville qui a fait faillite et dont la moiti\u00e9 des habitant est partie. Le coworking et l\u2019Art ont redonn\u00e9 vie \u00e0 la ville. Pour nous \u00e7a a \u00e9t\u00e9 un choc, l\u2019ultime preuve de concept, que l\u2019on a aussi v\u00e9cu \u00e0 moindre \u00e9chelle dans des villes comme Kansas City, Lisbonne et quelques autres.En conclusion, soyez d\u00e9termin\u00e9s ! Cultivez votre d\u00e9termination et n\u2019oubliez pas que vous \u00eates sur le fil du rasoir, en permanence avec, d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9 le risque de perdre sa d\u00e9termination et, de l\u2019autre, le risque de l\u2019obstination.

Online users of the NYPL Digital Collections website will find more prominent download links and filters highlighting restriction-free content; while more technically inclined users will also benefit from updates to the Digital Collections API enabling bulk use and analysis, as well as data exports and utilities posted to NYPL\u2019s GitHub account.

The \u2018remix\u2019, as many of us know it, went mainstream in the 90\u2019s when hip-hop exploded onto the scene, with crews like P Diddy\u2019s Bad Boy Family leading the way.Nowadays, a high percentage of music released will come with a number of remixes in order to reach a number of different audiences and maximise airplay and sales.Though \u2018Diddy may claim to have \u2018invented the remix\u2019, in truth remix culture has been around for decades, as hip hop pioneer Grandmaster Flash explained to Remix Theory;\u201cThe concept of Remix often referenced in popular culture derives from the model of music remixes which were produced around the late 1960s and early 1970s in New York City, an activity with roots in Jamaica\u2019s music.\u201dWhat is Remix Culture?Grandmaster Flash defines remix culture as; \u201cthe global activity consisting of the creative and efficient exchange of information made possible by digital technologies that is supported by the practice of cut/copy and paste.\u201dThe idea of cut/copy and paste mentioned by Grandmaster Flash has transcended generations and technology. From disco DJ\u2019s cutting and pasting tapes together to make remixes in NYC during the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, to the remixers of today cutting and pasting together digital content.The remix has extended much further than music and has become a part of everyday life, playing a huge part in the way we communicate and helping the general public become producers, rather than passive consumers.What does this mean for brands?Many brands have already embraced remix culture from Nike opening up design to consumers and allowing us to remix their trainers with Nike ID, to the numerous websites opening up their API\u2019s to third party developers.However, many brands are still missing out by not embracing this culture. Remix culture drives creativity and presents huge opportunity for brands to create a loyal fan base.The \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach no longer works and looking at customers as merely a target audience is no longer an approach brands should take.Now, a brand\u2019s target audience are their partners. Partners should have an input into product and the direction in which a brand moves.Our culture is obsessed with remixing content and showing individuality. Brands should look to embrace this by creating content and messages that can be remixed and easily passed on.Brands need to embrace the fact their adverts may be remixed on YouTube, the fact their print designs may turn into memes or the fact their product may be criticised or redesigned across blogs.Remix Culture in ActionSmirnoffIn 2011, Smirnoff utilized their online community of customers and fans to ideas for their Nightlife Exchange project.For this campaign, the Vodka brand asked their online community \u2018what makes your nightlife most original? Allowed them to vote for their favorite ideas and even enter for a chance to be there for one of the events.This is a great example of how brands can collaborate with their audience and make them producers rather than passive consumers.Watch the video here.Old SpiceOld Spice is well known for their online campaigns over recent years and a few months ago they launched their \u2018Old Spice Muscle Music\u2019 campaign.The video itself features Terry Crews and shows him playing a variety of instruments by flexing his muscles.

Now, to take full advantage of Timetables, we\u2019re happy to announce that the trips in your timetables now feed into your Remix cost calculations.Here\u2019s how it works.Calculating Costs in RemixRemix provides three options for estimating costs: by hours, vehicles, and distance. These are available within your Remix map settings.Adjust the cost parameters for hours, buses, and miles in your Remix map settings.With trip-based costing, once you\u2019ve set up your flat per-hour, per-bus, or per-mile costs, Remix now multiplies these numbers by the corresponding trip-based estimates for revenue hours, vehicle estimates, and distance, respectively, to get your route cost estimates.Cost by HoursCost by revenue hours = sum of the revenue service hours of the trips in your timetables, plus layover time, all multiplied by per-hour cost.Remix calculates cost by hours by summing up the duration of all your trips plus layover, then multiplying it by your per-hour costs, where hours reflect the number of revenue hours per day your vehicles are open for business and carrying passengers.To determine the number of revenue hours, Remix sums the runtime of all the trips within each line on your map.In this timetable, each trip has a runtime of 20 minutes. There are three weekday trips for this route, which add up to a total of 60 minutes of revenue time.Remix also gives you the option to add layover time to each trip in the form of a percentage of the trip time or a minimum number of minutes. The Remix default is 10%, but it is fully customizable.In this example, keeping layover at 10% will add 6 minutes of total layover, giving you a grand total of 66 revenue minutes, or 1.1 revenue hours. Multiplying by your per-hour cost of $100 (from above) by 261 weekdays, you get a final cost estimate of $110 per day to run this route, or $28,710 per year.Cost by DistanceCost by distance = sum of the map distance of every trip in your timetable, including trips with different patterns and days of the week, all multiplied by per-mile (or per-km) cost.Similar to revenue hours, Remix calculates the cost by distance by summing up the distance of all your trips, then multiplying this by your per-mile (or per-km) costs, where distance reflects the number of revenue miles (or kms) per day your vehicles are open for business and carrying passengers. In the example from before, one trip is 15.63 miles. Summing these three trip distances up, we get a total daily revenue distance of 46.89 miles.This multiplied by the per-mile cost of $2.00 (from above) gets you a final cost estimate of $93.78 per day to run this route, or $24,477 per year.Cost by Vehicle CountsCost by bus count = best-case number of buses during peak service, multiplied by per-bus cost.Remix calculates cost by vehicle counts by determining the best-case number of buses needed to run the trips in your timetable, then multiplying this by your per-bus costs. Your best-case number of buses is your peak bus count, assuming that whenever a bus finishes a trip (plus layover), the bus is then available to make trips that begin from that time on. Let\u2019s dig into the example.By the time the first trip\u2019s bus ends service at 6:20, it could conceivably go back into service for the 6:30 trip. Remix considers this the \u201cbest case,\u201d and estimates that one bus can cover these two trips. Of course, the 6:15 trip can\u2019t share a bus with the 6:00 or 6:30 trips because it runs concurrent with the others. It must use its own bus. Therefore, in this example, Remix estimates two buses to run this service.Two buses multiplied by our per-bus cost of $5,000 (from above) gets a final cost estimate of $10,000 per year.(Note that vehicle counts don\u2019t account for deadhead. This means for trips that end far from another trip\u2019s starting point, additional buses that may be required to cover the distance are not counted. Remix also only pairs up trips within the same route.)Switching Between Trip- and Frequency-Based EstimatesWant to continue seeing your frequency-based estimates? We understand that you may need continuity in cost estimates for projects that are in flight. You can simply uncheck the trip-based costs box in your map settings, and you\u2019re back to frequency-based calculations! Re-check the box to go toggle back!You can toggle between frequency- and trip-based costing to wrap up projects in flight.Timetables and trip-based costing are now available to all Remix customers.

There\u2019s no substitute for hearing how proposed changes will affect your community from the riders themselves. During our most recent webinar outlining best practices for public outreach, a panel of transit professionals explored the best ways to open lines of communications with your community.Here are the main takeaways:1. Know what you need before you startIt might seem obvious, but before you begin public outreach you should have a goal for what you\u2019re trying to do. \u201cFocus your questioning on specific needs, whether it\u2019s redesigning your system or understanding customer satisfaction,\u201d says Mark Kirstner, Director of Planning at Piedmont Authority Regional Transportation. \u201cDon\u2019t try to hit riders with too many topics at once. Everyone\u2019s time is limited.\u201dUnderstanding your objective will also help you determine who you should be talking to. Depending on the goal of your outreach, you might need to talk to social service agencies, disability groups, or your region\u2019s biggest employers in addition to current riders.2. Go to where the people areNot everyone has time to attend a community meeting. So what better way to reach riders than when they\u2019re actually taking transit? \u201cOver the last couple of years, the mantra in public engagement has been go to where the people are,\u201d says Kirstner. \u201cWe just completed a fairly thorough onboard survey that compiled origin and destination data. It helped provide detail for our travel demand model in the region. Staff members literally got on the bus and talked to riders. It\u2019s a great way to have rider attention for 15\u201320 minutes.\u201dKelvin Miller, General Manager of The M in Montgomery, AL, says that his department got feedback from riders by using Remix to put a map of proposed changes on their website and allowing people to comment on it. \u201cIt let riders tell us what they liked and didn\u2019t like about different routes without having to show up for a public hearing,\u201d says Miller. \u201cTheir comments come directly from the website to me.\u201d3. Keep the focus on your entire system, not just individual routesWhen trying to solicit feedback about your transit system, it can be hard to keep the focus of the conversation on the system as a whole. After all, riders are typically most vocal about routes they personally use. Claire Johnson-Winegar, Planning Manager at Gold Coast Transit, handles this by creating tradeoff exercises. \u201cWe ask passengers questions about coverage versus frequency,\u201d Johnson-Winegar says. \u201cDo they want to walk further and have more direct service, or do they want to be picked up right by their home but have less frequent service? Presenting it like this shows how complicated transit is and translates to someone that there are tradeoffs.\u201dIt can be particularly tricky to keep the conversation on track in public hearings. Miller advises that when there\u2019s a rider that wants to use the meeting to talk about their individual route, it\u2019s important to strike a balance between hearing them out and keeping the conversation on track. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to ignore that person, so we try to resolve their issue as best we can. But when we\u2019re finished hearing their comment, we always bring it back to the entire system,\u201d says Miller. \u201cWe show them how the entire system will benefit them. For example, they won\u2019t have to ride the bus as long or make as many transfers.\u201dUsing data visualizations can help focus the conversation on the entire system, not just individual routes.4. Make your agency visible to get ongoing feedbackMany agencies use social media to keep their communities engaged in the day-to-day of transit. But getting riders to engage with your social presence can take patience, time, and strategy. \u201cWe\u2019ll re-tweet posts, and also solicit retweets from other agencies like the transportation commission,\u201d says Johnson-Winegar. \u201cWe\u2019ve also sponsored Facebook posts to broaden our reach.\u201dKirstner says that no matter how you disseminate information, you should designate one go-to source that will always be up to date and correct. \u201cWe have an email newsletter that includes any news about accidents or holiday changes. It goes out to a robust email list and riders have really come to rely on it.\u201dEven in the digital age, agencies can\u2019t neglect the importance of making themselves available to talk to riders. Gold Coast Transit sets up feedback stations to talk to riders about anything from new routes to logo redesigns. PART runs a call center that not only answers transit questions, but also collects valuable feedback from callers. And Miller personally talks to riders at transfer centers to get their take on how the M can make improvements. \u201cI talk to people to hear their take on what\u2019s good and bad about the service,\u201d he says.5. Show your progress to the board to build trustA big part of public outreach is communicating all of your newly gathered information to your board. To do that effectively, building trust is key. \u201cWe started bringing more and more to our board so they could see the work being done by our department,\u201d says Johnson-Winegar. \u201cWhen we do get some negative feedback, they already know that we\u2019re doing a lot to improve transit for our customers.\u201dHaving a visual to show to your stakeholders helps get your point across. \u201cWe met with the mayor and used Remix to show how the TDP compared to current service,\u201d said Miller. \u201cWe could actually show the population and jobs we serve, and how the system is improved using recommendations from the TDP.\u201dPublic outreach is about your ridersUltimately, talking to the public about transit makes you better at servicing your community. It helps you understand what riders need, get information to them about their transit system, and convey why public transit projects are beneficial. After all, public transit is ultimately about helping real people get from point A to point B, and that human element shouldn\u2019t be overlooked.\u201cOnce a year, we make a video for our board of trustees that highlights the riders by showing videos of what they think about our system,\u201d said Kirstner. \u201cIt puts a face on what we do.\u201dYou can watch the full hour-long panel discussion here:", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Transportation", "Public Transit", "Community Engagement", "Best Practices", "Planning"]}, {"title": "Reign Remix: Carson Pickett", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@ReignFC/reign-remix-carson-pickett-c86e1a2f6831?source=search_post", "author_name": "Reign FC", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ReignFC", "publish_date": "2017-11-27", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-10", "readtime": "0.36", "claps": 11, "voters": 3, "content": "Reign Remix: Carson PickettReign FCFollowNov 27, 2017 \u00b7 1 min readIn our Reign Remix series, we asked Reign FC players to create us a playlist of a few of their favorite songs right now, all-time, or just for game time.

If you tryna get lit in your PWI college basement party or you serving fresh with the children after-hours these remixes just show how versatile the King B stay being.Formation (DEAN-E-G Remix):One of the first remixes I heard, this house flip takes Bey\u2019s anthem and builds some appreciated dynamics without chopping up the her highness\u2019 vocals. Also, the drops will have you feeling your Naomi Campbell 90\u2019s supermodel oats.Formation (DNGR Jersey Club Remix)For those unfamiliar with Jersey Club rhythms it\u2019s about keeping up. It\u2019s about staying quick. It\u2019s not for the faint of heart. Still, the builds up get you ready to let loose. It\u2019s a definitive sound and your body will just know.Formation (FaboNick\u2019s Trap Remix)Probably the most pre-game/getting ready remix of the bunch, the trap aesthetic elevates the anthem just a babyhair closer to turnt. One of the best parts of the mix is that it really feels like a radio ready bump that moves from car to the club effortlessly.Formation (MikeQ Remix)I knew when I saw MikeQ had a remix of Formation it was gonna get me lit. A regular of the NY club scene, this mix for GHE20G0TH1K is really about the ambiance created. It\u2019s a stripped and hype essentialism of Formation\u2019s original slay. Try not to bop along, I dare ya.Formation (PLAYLMJ Remix)This is the most mellow of the remixes, unquestionably. The sound is like a spacey-hop and without minimizing any of the original\u2019s bump, this remix offers a more galactic vibe. Definitely a harder sell, but for fans of those youtube music playlist channels with instagram filter photos over hip-hop songs will like this (read: Majestic Casual et. al.).But hey these are just 5 of many!

Talent often finds itself in a crowded marketplace where you need some luck (including timing!) to go along with said talent.Building applications and services for people isn\u2019t the same as building movies, but there is a lot that each medium can learn from each other.I have been thinking about the current disruption of media, and if there is anything that we can learn from it on the software development side.Who Are The ProfessionalsThere are only 6-700 hollywood movies distributed in a given year. Compare that to the 500+ hours of video uploaded to YouTube alone. The realm of video used to be solely for huge groups with expensive equipment, coming together to create something (hopefully) epic. Now, everyone with a smart phone has a camera in their pocket and they aren\u2019t afraid to use it (and upload the results).It isn\u2019t only the creation of video content that matters of course, but the consumption side. Gone are the days where these videos were siloed off as family movies and the like. My kids jump on YouTube as their main source of video content, and the quality of some of the content is incredibly high (much of it is\u2026. no so).When we went mainstream, first the tools allowed you to capture video simply. Then, you could do simple edits and manipulation. Now, you can do a lot of top quality editing on your own device, not needing all of the expensive custom equipment. The high end tools push the barrier on what is possible with movies, and then the consumer grade software slowly follows and sucks up the good ideas and makes amazing things happen with a click or tap of a button. At this point services often go ahead and do all if this work proactively and just tell you \u201chey, I sticked together your content, and put it together with a great score\u2026. want to check it out?\u201dI notice that a lot of the content that my kids enjoy is very directly remixed. You can remix content at various levels of abstraction. At a high level you could take the concepts behind Joseph Campbell\u2019s hero\u2019s journey analysis. In fact you may have ended up following the pattern without even knowing it. At a lower level though you can take a product and add your touch. Maybe you didn\u2019t like the ending and create another one? Maybe you have something to add to the \u201cuniverse\u201d and you put in new adventures? Fan fiction has had a long history in society, and it seems that this is now exploding as the distribution of this content has less friction and fans can easily find it.There is something great about the constraints of one story, and the craft that the team put into it. I value that. I also value the ability for us to keep iterating and expand on these ideas. I have always dreamt of going to a movie and having a \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d experience where the audience votes. This would enable a special live experience, and chances are you would be willing to come back and give it another shot if the content was great. There is a certain amount of freedom given to the platform (movie distribution, theatre, capabilities, etc) the developer (people making the movie components) and the user (choose your own adventure).Crafting applications that mimic the large scale movie hits is one thing, but what about also enabling great remixing of these experiences?The Web has always had a foot in this world. We have mashups and iframes and the like, which have encouraged the joining of different sources beyond a backend API, and all in a fairly simple way. Marry this with responsive design and progressive enhancement and the content can know its constraints and adapt to them.Could we do more to the web platform to enable even more remixing and merging of experiences? Can we make it very secure? Could we use web components as a way to go beyond iframe?What if we used the fact that a <semantic-tag> is loosely coupled to its implementation? Developers could offer alternative implementations, and users could even make choices here too. I like it when the ecosystem has nobs for each group. On the other hand, it drives me nuts when I am in \u201cApplication A\u201d and want to send a URL to my browser of choice and instead am only given the option to pass it to the \u201cstandard\u201d browser. Too many of the integrations do not allow the user as much control as they would sometimes like. Browser extensions have been interesting because power users have mainly been the consumers. With these, and tools like greasemonkey, more was possible. They were often brittle, and they would often cause performance and/or security issues, but they did bring flexibility that didn\u2019t exist for users in other ways.We have all had instances where we use a product but wish it did something a lil different, or wish there was one minor feature. These features may not make the ROI of the product owner, but to you\u2026 they are P1. It would be nice to be able to enable a system where your priorities can be taken care of even if they aren\u2019t the top average priority.With progressive web apps we are bringing some important native capabilities to the Web, in a way that fits in well. Now that we have more capabilities, what can we do with them, and how can we apply the pieces that we love about the Web into this new Web. I have loved how traditionally easy it was for someone to get up and running with Web content. We had a period of time where we didn\u2019t keep going up the stack, and thus it is easy to bold some content, but it isn\u2019t easy to drop in rich controls.It is important to go after the movie makers, but I think it is also important to keep pushing to enable everyone else to be able to create compelling content too.

We were joined by several other agencies in the region including Champaign-Urbana (CUMTD) and Bloomington-Normal (Connect Transit), bringing together three of the major agencies in Downstate Illinois who are otherwise a 1\u2013 or 2-hour drive apart.While these three agencies had some level of coordination at the leadership or grant writing levels, we found that collaboration amongst service planners was not as common. We took the afternoon together as an opportunity to tour the SMTD facilities, share questions and conversations about each agency\u2019s strengths and challenges and walked through several Remix projects from each agency.Bay AreaWhen you live in a place with as many transit agencies as the Bay Area, ongoing coordination between agency staff is a critical element to provide seamless service to customers.

We were joined by transit planners from seven agencies across the region including AC Transit, County Connection, Union City Transit, Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, WestCat, and Santa Rosa Citybus. We spent an afternoon discussing local projects, Remix best practices, and even a bonus session on how Remix works, under the hood.Danny Whalen, VP Engineering, shares a love story about Remix and the data we use.During the Remix best practices session, we opened up Remix maps in each participant\u2019s city and talked through a project, garnering feedback from the group in terms of ideas and tips specific to Remix. The group also got to hear about a few secrets that we\u2019ll be excited to share in more detail in just a few months.Next Workshop location is _________We\u2019ve heard from attendees that the workshops have been extremely valuable and a tradition we should keep! If you\u2019re interested in hosting a Remix Regional Workshop for other Remix users in your area, reach out to your Customer Success Manager or email us here. We\u2019d love to sketch out a few ideas to make it a reality.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Public Transit", "Remix Conference"]}, {"title": "Reign Remix: C89.5 Halftime Mix", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@ReignFC/reign-remix-c89-5-halftime-mix-f3309f7e3269?source=search_post", "author_name": "Reign FC", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ReignFC", "publish_date": "2017-11-03", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-10", "readtime": "0.35", "claps": 4, "voters": 3, "content": "Reign Remix: C89.5 Halftime MixReign FCFollowNov 3, 2017 \u00b7 1 min readAll season long, our partner C89.5 brought the jams with their pregame, halftime, and postgame playlists.

As it says:Tate Collectives is an online and digital space for young creatives to discover, share and discuss art; run in conjunction with Tate\u2019s in-gallery programme for young people.The Tate held an open call for submissions for an 1840s gif party. They \u201c\u2026(invited) you to transform artworks from the 1840s room at Tate Britain into animated GIFs.\u201d At the Tumblr linked above, you can see some of the work, and you\u2019ll be able to see all of it this Friday at The Tate . Some of it stays well within the boundaries of \u201cart\u201d, some plays for laughs, some is a different animal entirely. But it\u2019s great, one of those moments I am thankful simply because it exists.Just prior to Christmas I spent some time with a museum here in New York which is reasonably well-known but under-patronised. They went to great lengths to talk about \u201cthe primacy of the art\u201d, looking down their noses even at The Met\u2019s Pinterest page which has works arranged in different ways, one of them subject matter (e.g. dogs!). They had decided it was somehow demeaning to the work, an opinion that is obviously highly subjective but was held to be a self-evident truth. They would be horrified at a Tumblr from the Tate inviting young artists to remix existing work, all the while wondering aloud how they can get a younger audience connecting with their own collection, never understanding that in order to connect we need to see something of ourselves reflected.I was thinking about this classically top-down approach as I played with the new Beats Music app. I\u2019ve been an avid Spotify subscriber for some time now, and it changed how I consumed music as much as my first iPod did, if not more so. What I love most about Spotify is the new music it has exposed me to. Having always loathed radio, the talking heads and advertisements were removed, leaving only the music to speak for itself. I would wager I\u2019ve listened to more new bands and artists over the past few years than the entire previous decade, entirely due to the discovery engine built up around the platform.While attempts are underway to automate that discovery engine, the things exposing new artists to me most of the time are decidedly people-powered. Twitter\u2019s Music, itself created off the back of We Are Hunted has been a God-send, but it\u2019s only useful thanks to people finding and sharing new music from around the web. Hype Machine. Soundcloud. And of course Spotify\u2019s playlists which may as well be infinite, curated again by thousands of users all over the world in the same way people used to make mix-tapes or CDs. The layer between me and the music (and thereby the culture) is as thin as can be; very little gets in the way.Contrast that with Beats Music. In classic music industry fashion, the front end is over-engineered with a \u201cwe know best\u201d veneer. Screen after screen of profiling in the setup in a vain attempt to deliver only the music you\u2019re wanting to hear, never thinking that perhaps part of the wonder of music is in discovering something you would never think to put on yourself. Beats makes overtures in this direction, but scratch the surface and you\u2019ll find curation at every turn. Established artist after established artist, as if I could somehow forget Coldplay exist.No plays for credibility, just a gold-toothed smile and a wink. \u201cTrust us.\u201dNo thanks.Beats may usurp Spotify, or it may join the pile of me-too start-ups from the corporate world that over-delivered on the what without ever understanding the why. It may even win over a whole legion of users with its slick introduction; they have clearly worked very hard on it.But in placing the platform ahead of its users, it asks you to listen and engage on their terms rather than your own. Like that museum more concerned with the pedestal the work has been placed on than the people who might come to see it, Beats seeks to enforce a Beats-way of doing things rather than building around the music and the audience themselves.Both museum and platform play the role of curator, and they do it with a staggering lack of vision for what that could mean in 2014.As Richard Nash has said, those in-between the artist and the audience need to be in the business of fostering a connection between the two. All any artist wants to do is to connect with their audience, but those who would play the role of publisher or curator must start from an understanding that the audience arrives and engages on its own terms. As the title of the Manic Street Preacher\u2019s 1998 album goes \u201cThis is my truth, tell me yours\u201d.Very well then, this is it: In modern times being re-contextualised and remixed isn\u2019t a slight.It\u2019s the highest compliment you can be paid.P.S.

For anyone who does not know yet, Remix is a online IDE for Smart Contracts development using Solidity.However, a Smart Contract project includes not only the Smart Contract source code itself but also testing, versioning and deploying tools and other artifacts. Mostly these artifacts are managed and built using other IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, Atom or vim. You can use these IDEs to write your Solidity code but they does not have the same support and tooling to deal with the complexities of Ethereum that Remix has.So, how to use the best of both worlds? That\u2019s where Remixd ( https://https://github.com/ethereum/remixd ) comes in. It is a small javascript service that connects a browser with a Remix page opened to local filesystem via websocket. As you write your Solidity code in Remix is automatically saved in your filesystem where your Visual Studio Code is pointing to.In order to use it you must have node.js and npm installed and working. But most importantly your node version must be the LTS (when this article was written it was 10.x). The latest version is not supported.To install remixd open your favorite terminal and run:$ npm install remixd -gAccess the directory where your want to store your Smart Contracts and run:$ remixd --remix-ide http://remix.ethereum.org -s ./It will start a websocket service allowing the connection from your browser opened at remix.ethereum.org page ( see - -remix-ide parameter) to your local filesystem at current directory ./ ( see -s parameter ) in port 65520You should see logs similar to this in your terminal:Now open your browser and access Remix IDE.In top left column click on the localhost connection button.A window explaining how it works is shown. Click at \u2018Connect\u2019 link to start the connection between your browser and the remixd service.After clicking on it, the localhost set of files is shown at Remix\u2019s left column. If there are files on the directory you choose on remixd service start they are going to be shown now.Select a file and change it. Later open the directory using your favorite IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code) and see the changes performed. In Visual Studio Code you can open the integrated terminal and try to execute a command as:$ git add Registro.solVoil\u00e0! Now your Remix online IDE is integrated with your favorite IDE.

The world begins as worlds often do, with the gods overthrowing the titans who built it and establishing their dominion over man and nature alike. The story abruptly jumps forward billions of years, however, to the inevitable feud between them that destroys all things. It is at this point that we encounter the remix goddess, who rises out of the ocean of white noise that their war left behind.From her neon throne, she looks back on mistakes that the gods made while ruling the world of mortals, and adjusts what she sees accordingly. Her long, needle-like fingernails dance along the dark vinyl of the universe\u2019s edge, and matter all throughout space-time rearranges in accordance with the resultant song. The gods at the beginning of time continuously adjust their plans for the universe in an attempt to foil her games, only to find that she\u2019s already changed another detail.For this reason, the history of the world is always in flux. Time\u2019s endpoints remain fixed, but the feedback loop between them leaves the universe in a state of perpetual reconstruction. Sometimes her changes are as simple as causing gobstoppers to go supernova when they come in contact with a human tongue, while other times they are as vast as making sugar itself the fifth classical element. Her changes always seem playful to those who notice them, as if to tell her predecessors that they\u2019re taking things too seriously.Although many worship the remix goddess, she is never referred to by the same name twice. While some speculate that this is a conscious and deliberate ritual, true believers insist that whatever name they are using is her true name at that exact moment.http://www.northofreality.com/tales/2015/5/29/the-remix-goddess", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Fiction", "Weird Fiction", "Mythology"]}, {"title": "Showing Route Options With Isochrones", "post_link": "https://blog.remix.com/showing-route-options-with-isochrones-57b84969407c?source=search_post", "author_name": "Remix", "author_link": "https://blog.remix.com/@remix123", "publish_date": "2015-09-01", "last_modified_date": "2018-02-12", "readtime": "1.30", "claps": 3, "voters": 2, "content": "Showing Route Options With IsochronesRemixFollowSep 1, 2015 \u00b7 2 min readJarrett Walker + Associates, a transportation planning consultancy and one of Remix\u2019s earliest customers, has been working with TriMet and the Oregon Metro on a new bus rapid transit line in Portland, the Powell-Division transit and development project.At a recent meeting for project stakeholders to discuss route options, Jarrett and his team presented printed maps of potential stop spacings created with Jane, our isochrone, which can be dragged and dropped onto any route made in Remix.In transportation planning, isochrones are used to depict areas of equal travel time. Jarrett used Jane to illustrate stop spacing \u2014 from the current spacing, to 1/2 mile, to one mile \u2014 on four potential routes for the Powell-Division project. These visualizations enabled stakeholders to better understand the tradeoffs between travel distance and stop spacing: the closer the stops, the fewer places the bus will be able to reach.Jarrett, whose book Human Transit addresses the geometry behind transportation planning, calls isochrones \u201cmaps of people\u2019s liberty and opportunity.\u201d Jane allows you to quickly and easily see how much someone can increase their liberty and opportunity by showing how far your route will allow them to travel.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Transportation", "Public Transit", "Portland", "Customer Stories", "Jarrett Walker"]}, {"title": "Ridership Versus Coverage: How VTA is Finding the Right Balance \u2014 Remix Webinar", "post_link": "https://blog.remix.com/ridership-versus-coverage-how-vta-is-finding-the-right-balance-61d14ce0a55?source=search_post", "author_name": "Remix", "author_link": "https://blog.remix.com/@remix123", "publish_date": "2016-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2017-08-25", "readtime": "0.60", "claps": 2, "voters": 2, "content": "Ridership Versus Coverage: How VTA is Finding the Right Balance \u2014 Remix WebinarRemixFollowJul 1, 2016 \u00b7 1 min readWe were excited to have two seasoned transit professionals join us for our 4th Remix Transit Talk to discuss an important and often debated topic: ridership versus coverage.Listen in to hear about how Michelle Poyourow from Jarrett Walker + Associates and Martin Barna from the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority have been approaching this challenging question.Listen in for this hour long discussion about how VTA is weighing the tradeoffs between ridership and coverage services.For more information about this project, check out VTA\u2019s Next Network project homepage.The potential high frequency network (in red) if selecting \u201cNetwork 90\u201d \u2014 where 90% of the resources go towards ridership-centric services.Thanks for those who were able to join us for this week\u2019s presentation!

It\u2019s a challenge to effectively communicate to all of these audiences to gain their support. How do you convince different stakeholders to support your plans and ride transit? What messages are right? How do you choose what tactics will work with each audience?At the 2017 Remix Conference, we brought together three experts to discuss what methods work for them to better communicate the value of transit to different audiences. Here\u2019s the top takeaways from Belinda Woodiel-Brill, Director of Communications and Service Development at KAT BUS in Knoxville, TN, Kelvin Miller, General Manager of the M in Montgomery Alabama, and Leslie Caceda, Transportation Technologist at the Atlanta Regional Commission:Paul Supawanich, Belinda Woodiel-Brill, Kelvin Miller, and Leslie Caceda discuss how public transit agencies can effectively convey the value of their service to different audiences.Market to each audience. You don\u2019t necessarily need to invest major resources in a big marketing campaign. In fact, a one-size fits all approach may be the wrong one. Some audiences care about environmental benefits, others economic development, and some want to hear about transportation options.Meet your audience where they are. The after work public meeting is not going to reach 99 percent of your audience. Instead go to breweries, coffee shops, universities, workplaces. Have an online presence. People aren\u2019t going to come to you, you have to go to them.Create partnerships. Find partners that are \u201cmore popular than transit\u201d like a hip business district that has a ton of media followers. The M in Montgomery, Alabama partners with different agencies, like human services, whose clients ride the bus. The partnership makes it easier to inform potential riders and receive feedback.You might not be your best messenger. When Knoxville undertook a system redesign, the agency brought together a subcommittee of board members who were a part of every step of the process. Together they hashed out concerns and made improvements as they moved through the planning stages. When the final design went to the board for a vote, the board sub-committee presented the plan to their peers \u2014 and it passed in seconds.Start with the front line. Who interacts with your customers everyday? The operators. They\u2019re your best marketers. Empower them to understand the value they contribute to making the system a comfortable, safe, friendly atmosphere that works best for riders.You can catch the full panel discussion here!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Transportation", "Remix Conference", "Public Transportation", "Public Transit"]}, {"title": "Reign Remix: Larissa Crummer", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@ReignFC/reign-remix-larissa-crummer-7fbd8412b466?source=search_post", "author_name": "Reign FC", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@ReignFC", "publish_date": "2017-12-06", "last_modified_date": "2019-02-10", "readtime": "0.36", "claps": 2, "voters": 2, "content": "Reign Remix: Larissa CrummerReign FCFollowDec 6, 2017 \u00b7 1 min readIn our Reign Remix series, we asked Reign FC players to create us a playlist of a few of their favorite songs right now, all-time, or just for game time.

While the book is a little dated now, it contains a plethora of software design gems. The one that stuck with me the most over the years is \u201cConventions are your friends\u201d in Chapter 3.Short of copying and pasting the whole section, here are my three favorite excerpts, starting with how an idea becomes a convention:All conventions start life as somebody\u2019s bright idea. If the idea works well enough, other sites imitate it and eventually enough people have seen it in enough places that it needs no explanation.Why conventions are useful (emphasis mine):As a rule, conventions only become conventions if they work. Well-applied conventions make it easier for users to go from site to site without expending a lot of effort figuring out how things work. (\u2026) There\u2019s a reassuring sense of familiarity\u2026Krug\u2019s ultimate recommendation:Innovate when you know you have a better idea (and everyone you show it to says \u201cWow!\u201d), but take advantage of conventions when you don\u2019t.Reduce, Reuse, RecycleAbout a year ago I started on the initial product design that would become Runscope. Knowing we were building something completely new I wanted to introduce as few new concepts as possible. With Krug\u2019s voice in my head I was determined to make the best use of existing conventions.I thought it would be fun to look back at the concepts we borrowed from other services with the benefit of hindsight. Which ones worked out? Which do we regret? Let\u2019s find out.BucketsBuckets are the term we use for organizing your requests by project, app, customer or whatever else works for you. The name was borrowed from S3 but my intial idea for how they would work was more like Gmail\u2019s filters and labels. Using a well-known name from another developer tool with the behavior from another tool ended up being pretty confusing. Some early external feedback drove this point home and in the end buckets ended up much closer to their S3 brethren.Verdict: right decision after an adjustment.StarsIn a fast moving stream of API calls, we were looking for a way to single out requests to save and easily reference later. Gmail\u2019s stars seemed like a good model for this. That ended up to not be the case. It forced people to use buckets for lighter-weight organization and those weren\u2019t a good fit for a variety of reasons. We needed a middle ground: a simple organization method within a bucket. Verdict: Not a useful convention for us.CollectionsWe replaced Stars with Collections. They\u2019re conceptually similar to Gmail\u2019s labels: lightweight, user-defined and optionally one-to-many. With starred requests you had to attribute your own meaning to what starring meant. For collections, you define the meaning in the name you give them. It\u2019s much more flexible. Verdict: Right decision.Sharing LinksIn need of a way to share API calls across account boundaries (e.g. to send to an API\u2019s support team) I immediately thought of Dropbox\u2019s shareable links. We implemented it just like Dropbox, with an explicit click to make a request public and create a public, shareable URL. Public links can be revoked at any time. Revoking and resharing creates a new, unique URL.A funny thing happened. When asking people to share requests with us, people would click the link to go to the share preview page and then send us the URL for that page, even after clicking the \u2018Create Share Link\u2019 button and being presented with the public URL. Even making the button and resulting URL much more prominent didn\u2019t fix it. It took a little bit of history.replaceState() cleverness to mitigate the confusion.If I could go back, I\u2019d simplify the feature. Every request would have a single non-guessable URL with a simple public/private visibility toggle (like Sentry). We may still do this, though revokability is an issue. Verdict: Right idea, but a little over-engineered.Teams/OrganizationsThe first version of our identity database had tables Accounts and Users with every user belonging to a single account. Frank wisely deleted that as soon as he saw it. People very rarely have a single organizational association. We ended up using the GitHub model of users and organizations (we call them Teams). This has given us and our customers a lot of flexibility.Verdict: one of the best early decisions\u2026thanks Frank!Many MoreThese examples are just from our initial Traffic Inspector product. In Runscope Radar (our new product for automated API testing) we\u2019ve also re-used concepts like integration testing assertions and variables with a Mustache-like template syntax.Next time you\u2019re designing a new feature, listen to your inner Steve Krug:Sometimes time spent reinventing the wheel results in a revolutionary new rolling device.

It Makes a DifferenceRemixFollowApr 19, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readOpen Demographic Data Enhances MobilityPublic transportation authorities all over the world use demographic data to analyze and improve mobility in their cities. Here\u2019s very simple example of how overlaying population and jobs data can help analyze the number of people who can access the route, as well as the number of required vehicles, frequencies, and vehicle capacity:In the video, you can see the level of detail of US census block data, which gives great estimates of population, jobs, and other demographic information.Different Countries, Different Levels of DetailHowever, major differences still exist in the level of detail available in different countries\u2019 data. The European Union provides data for population grids of 1 sq km. This is how Europe\u2019s population density looks in Remix:Population density of the European Union, using 1 sq-km grids, zoomed to a 300-km view.But EU data is just one dataset of hundreds; each country, region, or municipality within the EU typically collects demographic data with its own level of granularity. For example, let\u2019s look at the differences between the open data used in the island nation of Malta and in the UK, both viewed at the same scale (500m):Population density by census block in Malta (left) and the UK (right). The level of detail of demographic data differs greatly based on location.Maltese census data is less detailed than the 1 sq-km grids provided by the EU, whereas the UK open data is much more detailed than the 1 sq-km grids.Shorter Routes Require More Detailed DataWhen it comes to estimating the population affected by a change in the bus system, it is critical for this data to be as accurate as possible. The smaller each section of the map is, the better results we get. In Manchester, there are significant changes when we switch between calculating the EU data of 1 sq-km grids and UK data, which is much more detailed:In general, the EU 1 sq-km grids provide results within 90% accuracy on long lines with evenly spaced stops along the route. However, for shorter or irregular routes, the accuracy provided by the 1 sq-km grids decreases dramatically, which can make insights drawn from the data unreliable.Most cities in Europe do have more detailed data than the 1 sq-km grids provided by the EU, typically at the city council, regional government, or district level. And even though some of this data might not be open to the public, it is generally made accessible to transit agencies by the country\u2019s Public Transportation Authority upon request.At Remix, we encourage all transit agencies to use the most detailed data available during their planning process, as it improves accuracy and reliability for the end users of the system \u2014 which gets at the main goal of providing mobility to the greatest number of people possible.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Transportation", "Government", "Demographics", "Public Transit", "Maps"]}, {"title": "The Battle of Trees, remix", "post_link": "https://cosgrrrl.com/the-battle-of-trees-remix-624274619b7c?source=search_post", "author_name": "marjorie steele", "author_link": "https://cosgrrrl.com/@creativeonion", "publish_date": "2017-09-09", "last_modified_date": "2017-12-14", "readtime": "0.90", "claps": 14, "voters": 4, "content": "Photo by veeterzy (Pexels)The Battle of Trees, remixmarjorie steeleFollowSep 9, 2017 \u00b7 1 min readAn homage to the song of the same name by the great Bard Taliesin, bringer of the Kingdom of Summer Stars and chief poet to King Arthur.

At the time, I resisted the urge to talk too much about what it was that I was hoping to accomplish with the publication, what I thought we were doing, what we were planning for the future. The manifesto and the articles spoke for themselves. (They still do, but I have more news as well.)Eidolon published six articles in its first month:Michael Fontaine compared the second half of Virgil\u2019s Aeneid with the Israel/Palestine conflict in Aeneas in PalestineCurtis Dozier explored the resonance of Snickers\u2019 choice to use the image of Medusa for their ad on the back cover of Sports Illustrated in Hungry EyesI questioned (and eventually championed) the possibility of feminist scholarship on the male-dominated genre of Greek tragedy in Not All TragediansSpencer Lenfield argued that Alcaeus deserves more attention than he gets in The Other Poet from LesbosJohn Byron Kuhner looked to Cato\u2019s De Agri Cultura for instructions on how to grow cabbages and instead found advice for how to manage slaves in Of Cabbages and KingsChris Childers made the case for the influence of Horace\u2019s Odes 2.10 on Thomas Hardy\u2019s poem to commemorate the sinking of the Titanic in The Convergence of the TwainEidolon\u2019s content covers a wide span of topics and tones: humor, current events, personal essays, meditations on classical scholarship and reception. Although the schedule hasn\u2019t yet been inscribed in stone, the June articles should represent a similar range, from references to classical texts in hip-hop songs to topographical allusions in Virgil. There will also be a few articles comparing approaches to controversial issues (such as gay marriage) in the ancient and modern world. Our goal in writing about these issues isn\u2019t to fabricate easy identifications \u2014 the ancients, unlike celebrities, were emphatically not \u201cjust like us.\u201d Instead, our writers will attempt to find meaning in the uneasy resonances.In Eidolon\u2019s manifesto, I wrote that we expected and hoped to be surprised by what people submitted. This wish has already been fulfilled: in the last month, Eidolon has received dozens of article pitches by scholars across a broad spectrum of interests, nationalities, and stages in their careers. The volume of submissions has been high enough that we\u2019re switching to a twice-weekly publication schedule for the month of June. Starting next week, you will now find new content on Eidolon every Monday and Thursday.We\u2019re also introducing a new way to receive that content: directly in your inbox. Last month the only options for following Eidolon were Facebook, Twitter, and Medium itself (which requires a Facebook or Twitter account). Since not everybody uses social media, we\u2019re introducing a new alternative: an opt-in monthly newsletter with all of Eidolon\u2019s articles. You can sign up for the newsletter here.So far, the articles on Eidolon have been completely new material, drawn from scholars\u2019 lives rather than from their previous published work. Although I expect the majority of the journal\u2019s content to conform to this model, there\u2019s also an opportunity for scholars to submit another kind of piece that might be more organic to the rest of their research: a shorter version of a published, peer-reviewed article or book that has been rethought and rewritten for a more general audience.One of the most interesting articles I read this past week was a post here on Medium by Patrick Dunleavy called \u201cHow to write a blogpost from your journal article\u201d. The whole piece is worth a read, but this paragraph particularly resonated with me:So having explained all this to blogging sceptics, the question I ask is \u2014 \u2018You\u2019ve put eighteen months or two years of your life into doing the research in your article. You\u2019ve devoted months more to writing the paper and sending it to journals, dealing with comments, doing rewrites and hacking through the publishing process. Why would you not spend the extra couple of hours needed now to pull out from your journal article the key bits needed for a good blogpost?\u2019I don\u2019t necessarily share Dunleavy\u2019s optimism that writing a good shorter version of your article will only take a \u201ccouple of hours.\u201d In my experience, it can take a few days to give careful thought to what your piece will say, refamiliarize yourself with a few key pieces of relevant scholarship, and write your reformulated argument in clear prose. Time is a scarce and highly valued commodity in academe, but writing for a venue such as Eidolon rarely requires time-consuming tasks such as an exhaustive literature review. And the time spent writing is repaid swiftly in the immediate reception of the article, which feels more like the kind of lively discussion that follows an engaging lecture or conference paper.Dunleavy\u2019s argument reminded me of the Article Remix, an excellent idea introduced almost a year ago by Katie Rose Guest Pryal. Whereas Dunleavy imagines the blog post as a way to point scholars in your field toward your published work, Pryal sees it as a way to reach a broader audience:Take your amazing scholarly work, and write about it in on your blog or on a guest post on another blog. Avoid jargon. Keep it short. Make it meaningful to people outside your field. Show us how we can use your ideas to make the world a better place, even in a small way. Then tweet a link to the post using the hashtag #articleremix.(Neither Dunleavy nor Pryal address the idea of writing remixes of monographs, but I think the idea has even more relevance in relation to longer scholarship. If you can\u2019t describe in 2,000 jargon-free words why your book is exciting and interesting, you may have cause for concern.)Eidolon is precisely the kind of publication to which scholars should be sending their remixed articles. If you\u2019re looking to publish pieces that will point other classicists toward your formal scholarship, an open-access journal like this one can certainly help create a conversation.

How Southwest Idaho understood the benefits of BRTRemixFollowJun 26, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readBoise, ID, one of America\u2019s fastest growing cities: flickr user: John PennyFor most people, it\u2019s hard to know what a line on a map signifies. How fast will the bus go? Will it get me to my destination on time? And for decision makers, it\u2019s hard to know if the extra investment is worth it.For Duane Wakan of the Community Planning Association of Southwest Idaho (COMPASS), being able to visualize choices \u2014 and costs \u2014 turned out to be the best way to win support for an ambitious transportation network in the region.Not Enough ServiceTreasure Valley \u2014 home to about 688,000 people in Ada and Canyon counties \u2014 is projected to grow by 2040 to just over a million residents. The agency is planning for the future and searching for a dedicated, sustainable funding source. It is updating its long range plan, Communities in Motion 2040 2.0, and Duane is developing more robust and necessary transportation services.\u201cBefore I got here, there was a consultant hired to help develop a vision for public transportation for the Treasure Valley. It was building upon the existing system, and they constrained the growth of the transit system based on block density population and employment densities,\u201d Duane said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t provide a lot of access for the Treasure Valley.\u201dToday\u2019s transit in the Treasure ValleyMuch of the existing design is inefficient, with circuitous routing. Meridian, the second largest city in Idaho, has little transit services, and Caldwell and Nampa have a combined population of 160,000 residents yet only have access to six routes. \u201cCurrently there are no high frequent routes 15 minute headways or better in the Treasure Valley,\u201d Duane said. \u201cCompare that to Wenatchee, Washington, population 115,000 has 19 routes with three high frequent routes.\u201cPublic outreach during the first Communities in Motion effort source: The Blue ReviewThrough board meetings and discussions with elected officials, consensus grew for a more comprehensive vision. Leaders asked for bus rapid transit, too, which meant Duane would have to start fresh. \u201cSuccessful projects are not just putting a line on a map and saying oh, we\u2019ve got this transit system already, let\u2019s throw in a high capacity transit line and call that something that would serve the region,\u201d he said. \u201cThe intent is to fully integrate and redesign around high capacity transit.\u201dReal-time Remix VisualizationJane \u2014 Remix\u2019s feature that maps a transit shed instantaneously \u2014 was key. Placing Jane anywhere in a city helps not only see how far a rider can go on any given route but also the effect of bus speed.Using Remix, Duane chose Boise as the point of origin and then isolated the proposed BRT route. In real-time he showed the transportation working group members what would happen if the buses\u2019 average speed more than doubled. \u201cI said, let\u2019s show what our existing average speed is for the bus, which is 12 and half miles per hour, and how far can Jane go in 15, 30, 45, 60 minute transit sheds,\u201d Duane recalled. \u201cAnd then, as I increased the speed, I pushed it up to an average 30 mph, and then I could show, \u2018This is why we need to make investments in this corridor. Investments matter.\u2019\u201dDuane\u2019s image showing the impact of BRT (at a travel speed of 12.5 miles per hour)Comparing the current and potential future transit influence in the Treasure Valley.The dramatic expansion of access, shown as isochrones, convinced the group. To add in a high capacity route, Duane moved from loops to a trunk-and-feeder design. \u201cRemix was really critical for us to analyze frequencies, showing how we can make improvements to our system to make it more attractive for future growth,\u201d he said.Duane found the software intuitive. \u201cAs I developed each of these iterations, I could identify the operations costs. I could talk about the improvements and frequency as we moved throughout time from our existing system to 2040,\u201d he said. \u201cRemix was really cool. With the new vehicle types, I was able to talk about commuter rail, and I was able to find the per hour costs.\u201dCost-Benefit AnalysisIn developing the different transit systems, Duane used Remix to output the operations costs. \u201cI showed that with the same amount of money, we could have a much more expansive system.\u201d\u201cUsing Remix was really invaluable to me,\u201d Duane said. \u201cTo be able to produce a long range plan, put in our unfunded list \u2014 \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got this ambitious network, here\u2019s what it\u2019s gonna cost. Here\u2019s the per capita contributions that we\u2019ll need to make this happen.\u2019 So it\u2019s really been helpful.\u201dThe final plan goes forward for approval in December of 2018. Duane is pleased with the more expansive transportation network he\u2019s developed for the Treasure Valley, and for the support it has received. Making real those one-dimensional lines made a big difference. \u201cWhen you try to communicate to audiences goals, objectives, and strategies, it\u2019s really difficult to show them, \u2018what is improved access? What does that look like?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe can use Remix to paint that picture visually. We can communicate to our elected officials and our planners why these are important objectives and strategies.\u201dDuane says Remix helped him tell the story, to make the system understandable. He added, \u201cI am more visual. If I can\u2019t visualize things, how can I explain it to the public? That\u2019s how I see the world.\u201dIf you\u2019re interested in how Remix visuals can help you tell your transportation story, contact us to learn more!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Transportation", "Public Transit", "Customer Story"]}, {"title": "TRB panel recap: Cities Leading the Way on Micromobility", "post_link": "https://blog.remix.com/trb-panel-recap-cities-leading-the-way-on-micromobility-351780361e40?source=search_post", "author_name": "Remix", "author_link": "https://blog.remix.com/@remix123", "publish_date": "2019-01-22", "last_modified_date": "2019-01-22", "readtime": "3.22", "claps": 6, "voters": 2, "content": "TRB panel recap: Cities Leading the Way on MicromobilityRemixFollowJan 22 \u00b7 4 min readSeleta, Paul, Emily, Jason, and Sam rounded out our panel in front of approximately 200 guests in WashingtonIt was an exciting and snowy week in Washington during the 2019 Transportation Research Board Conference. The event drew over 14,000 people from around the world to discuss trends in transportation from aviation, freight, urban mobility and much more. A hot topic amongst cities centered on the rapid growth of shared scooter and bikeshare fleets. These forms of \u201cmicromobility\u201d have posed new opportunities, challenges, and have set the stage for new types of partnerships to develop between local governments and the private sector.We gathered a panel of industry experts on the topic to hear their stories and share takeaways with our audience.The panel included:Seleta Reynolds, General Manager, Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT)Paul Supawanich, Head of Mobility Policy, RemixEmily Warren, Senior Director of Policy and Partnerships, LimeJason JonMichael, Chief Innovation Office, City of Austin, TexasThe panel was moderated by Samantha (Sam) Herr from the North American Bikeshare Association (NABSA).To kick things off, Sam outlined the definition of \u201cmicromobility\u201d from NABSA\u2019s perspective:Working together across the transportation industrySeleta outlined the necessity of governments and private companies developing a mutual understanding of each other\u2019s strengths and needs.I say cities should behave more like a product company, but I wish product companies would sometimes act more like cities. Product companies need to act with more humility and vulnerability.\u2014 Seleta Reynolds, LADOTShe went on to challenge city leaders to be proactive towards this change.The stakes are really high. If we don\u2019t change the way we are doing things it\u2019s going to get worse and we are going to lose the cities we love.Emily from Lime followed to applaud LA\u2019s existing efforts to help create a private sector ecosystem by leading on the Mobility Data Specification (MDS) that enables a mutual language to be shared between the public and private sector.Seleta gave us a gift with MDS. She gave us something we as a product company understand; my engineers understand.  \u2014 EmilyEveryone in a city is your consumer. \u2014 PaulSpeaking of mutual understanding, Paul from Remix re-iterated how important it is that private companies be conscious of the responsibility local governments carry to serve everyone within their communities \u2014 highly diverse communities with numerous needs. It\u2019s an understanding and type of collaboration that may represent a change in approach to how the public and private sectors have traditionally operated.Jason JonMichael discusses the parallels of today\u2019s technological collaboration with past challenges.We faced this in the 90s.\u2014 Jason JonMichael, City of AustinJason from the City of Austin described a time in the 90s where the industry was similarly faced with new technologies and a need to come together. However, there was not enough leadership or momentum to forge unity.We created NCTIP for cameras and signs etc. it never came to fruition. We had no way to validate that standard and everyone interpreted as they wanted. \u2014 JasonFuture opportunitiesWhen asked the question on the importance of mobility data for cities, Paul brought up the notion of \u201cBig Scooter\u201d.You may have heard of \u201cBig Oil\u201d or \u201cBig Auto\u201d, but I\u2019m going to talk about \u201cBig Scooter.\u201d Why I\u2019m excited about Big Scooter is because we, for the first time, have a national industry that has safer infrastructure in their interests. It\u2019s an opportunity to help planners and local advocates capture the data needed to support safer streets.\u2014 PaulIf \u201cBig Scooter\u201d can get VCs to pay for bike lanes, we\u2019ve really done something. \u2014 EmilyPanelist best and worst case predictions for 2019We asked our panel to provide their predictions for 2019. What are their opinions on the best and worst case outcomes for the industry?Jason\u2019s best case: I\u2019m not dealing with scooters next year [in the context of programs becoming more normalized]Emily\u2019s best case: We have the data sharing architecture in place that lets us shift people off cars \u2014 EmilyPaul\u2019s best case: We see the foundation for more balanced fees across private vehicles, including congestion pricingSeleta\u2019s best case: A government is monitoring MDSSeleta\u2019s worst case: A private mobility walled garden formsAt the day\u2019s end, it\u2019s a transformative time in the industry and we believe that it\u2019s a critical time to equip cities with the tools needed to effectively serve their community.Thanks to everyone who joined us for this amazing panel.

Pour finir de se convaincre, en 2015, 57% des 40\u201359 ans ont un smartphone.Le digital traverse le temps comme une tendance de fond, bien plus que comme un fait li\u00e9 \u00e0 une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration.La crise ?Les Y ont grandi dans la crise dit-on. N\u2019\u00e9tait-ce pas le cas de leurs pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs ? Et si l\u2019on regarde ce que disent les chiffres, ils confirment (depuis 1950) une baisse du taux de croissance du PIB en France. La crise accompagne d\u00e9j\u00e0 plusieurs g\u00e9n\u00e9rations, et n\u2019est donc pas en tant que tel un fait g\u00e9n\u00e9rationnel particulier. Enfin sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 global de la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration Y. Aux USA, en Inde ou en Chine (qui regroupe 200 millions de \u201cgenY\u201d), la situation \u00e9conomique est diff\u00e9rente puisque c\u2019est la croissance. Or la crise est r\u00e9put\u00e9e \u00eatre l\u2019un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments fondateurs de la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration Y. Allez comprendre\u2026Rebelles les Y ?Les Y en entreprise correspondent au middle-management (environ 35 ans). Ce middle-management, pr\u00e9tend \u00e0 acc\u00e9der aux postes de senior et top managers et a du mal \u00e0 percer ce \u201cplafond gris\u201d (grey ceiling) car les boss cinquantenaires et soixantenaires s\u2019y accrochent. En aval, ils sont oblig\u00e9s de prot\u00e9ger leur poste face aux assauts des jeunes g\u00e9n\u00e9rations qui souhaitent int\u00e9grer l\u2019entreprise.Bref, et sans pr\u00e9juger des attentes ou des besoins humaines de cette cat\u00e9gorie, nous avons une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration toute aussi contrainte et conservatrice que la pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. La r\u00e9bellion des Y en entreprise est un mythe qui dissimule plut\u00f4t la v\u00e9tust\u00e9 des modes de management traditionnels qui n\u2019ont jamais vraiment \u00e9t\u00e9 remis en question.Alors, g\u00e9n\u00e9ration X ou g\u00e9n\u00e9ration Y ou autre concept pr\u00e9fabriqu\u00e9 ? \u2014 au Remix Petites \u00c9curiesLa g\u00e9n\u00e9ration Y, c\u2019est s\u00e9rieux ou pas ?Si l\u2019on regarde en arri\u00e8re, c\u2019est le magazine Ad Age d\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00e0 la communication et \u00e0 la publicit\u00e9, qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 le concept de g\u00e9n\u00e9ration Y en 1993, tandis que la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration X est issue du travail de deux journalistes : Charles Hamblett et Jane Deverson (Generation, Fawcett Publications,\u200e 1964). La g\u00e9n\u00e9ration Y est donc un concept marketing destin\u00e9 \u00e0 appr\u00e9hender une nouvelle g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de consommateurs \u00e0 priori r\u00e9fractaires aux messages publicitaires l\u00e0 o\u00f9 la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration X est issue d\u2019une r\u00e9flexion sociologique et journalistique.Ainsi, derri\u00e8re l\u2019illusion d\u2019une classification des g\u00e9n\u00e9rations, il n\u2019y a pas de coh\u00e9rence en termes de raisonnement. Le Y c\u2019est du marketing, c\u2019est tout. Quel paradoxe que de se retrouver clo\u00eetr\u00e9 dans un concept marketing, alors que le marketing \u201c\u00e0 la papa\u201d fait justement partie de ces choses que beaucoup d\u2019entre nous rejettent.Un dernier motLa g\u00e9n\u00e9ration Y n\u2019est donc qu\u2019un concept marketing dont les faits structurants sont des tendances de fond bien plus que des faits purement g\u00e9n\u00e9rationnels. L\u2019angoisse du vide et le besoin ardent de simplification l\u2019a popularis\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s des relais d\u2019opinion, en masquant le manque de rigueur qui a servi \u00e0 le d\u00e9finir.

His organization\u2019s board also unites representatives from the Central Indiana Regional Transit Authority, IndyGo (Indianapolis\u2019 transit operator), and the airport and port authorities, all of which touch about 1.3 million people.Building support and preparing for the referendumBesides granting out roughly $45 million yearly in federal funds for jurisdictions to spend on the construction of roads, bridges, and sidewalks, Indy MPO maintains a federally mandated 25-year long-range plan and collects and funds planning programming in five-year increments to advance that plan. It\u2019s standard procedure for a metropolitan planning organization, and in the mix right now is a potential tax increase to fund fixed-route service in Hamilton County.With two cities of over 80,000 people each, the suburban county, north of Indianapolis, is one of the fastest-growing areas in the state. The referendum to increase income taxes by a quarter of a cent could be voted on as soon as September by residents of Hamilton County and Marion County (whose fixed-route service is provided by IndyGo).Indy MPO used Remix to research, design, and plan Hamilton County\u2019s potential fixed-route service in advance of the referendum.KEY RESULTS WITH REMIX1. Guiding stakeholders with a dose of reality\u201cThe questions that we have to answer before we go out and ask the public that question is, what does a quarter of a cent buy me?\u201d says Jeremy Moore, a senior planner at Indy MPO. \u201cWe do the calculations on our own and give that information to a group called the Hamilton County Transit Forum, which is a collective action group that got together to produce a transit plan for Hamilton County.\u201d Particularly useful for this purpose was Remix\u2019s demographic layers and costing calculations: \u201cThey looked at network design and governance and public engagement. We gave them a budget, basically, and they then designed a few different iterations of what a transit network could look like in Hamilton County and, by using Remix, they were able to make sure that the projections were realistic, they weren\u2019t putting too much or too little service on the street, they could see the demographics for it, everything like that,\u201d says Sean.2. Developing 7 different scenarios for 7 different funding levels\u201cWe do everything on the map,\u201d says Jeremy, \u201cand then check the data as we go, so we price routes and figure out, ideally, what route would you want and how much would that route cost? And then we can make quick adjustments to the frequency, which is really helpful.\u201d Indy MPO has created scenarios for seven different types of funding levels. \u201cIt\u2019s been really nice, because we\u2019ve been able to bounce back and forth between those different scenarios and show exactly how much service they\u2019re getting for each one of them,\u201d Jeremy says. Once the map is ready to show publicly, he\u2019ll export Remix maps as shapefiles and create maps as a combination of GIS and Adobe Illustrator.3. Eliminating a six-figure consultant projectUsing Remix has eliminated the need for a consultant to assess what Hamilton County would get with its potential tax increase. \u201cWe did this in-house. Remix allowed Jeremy to do the vast majority of this work himself. If we would have bid this out, I can\u2019t imagine it would have cost less than $100,000 or $150,000, and we were able to do this in-house,\u201d says Sean. The two think that, had they pursued this project without Remix, they would have needed some combination of financial model, GIS, and a Python algorithm, which would have required much more time and effort.\u201cIt would\u2019ve been really onerous to try and do! There are just some projects that the MPO uses funds to hire a consultant for, and that may have been what we ended up doing until this came along,\u201d Jeremy says. \u201cWe felt we had sufficient capacity, especially because of the time-saving features of Remix that we could get this accomplished with our staff.\u201dI think it\u2019s pretty safe to say what we\u2019ve done, because of having Remix, we would not have been able to do without it. The difference is between doing it and not doing it, in a sense. Without Remix, it would\u2019ve been impossible.Sean believes that, beyond the time saved, Remix enabled this project to exist in the first place: \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty safe to say what we\u2019ve done, because of having Remix, we would not have been able to do without it.

But first, they\u2019ll need to address the challenges of their transit schedule.The \u201cRace to Zero\u201dWhen the team at Antelope Valley Transit Authority (AVTA), heard about the Race to Zero Emissions competition, they knew they had to take part. The competition is a friendly challenge between transit agencies to build out the first fully emissions-free bus fleet. In 2018, the US Department of Transportation and Chinese Ministry of Transportation will announce the city that has made the most progress toward the goal.With a significant portion of its fleet already electric, the AVTA team knew they had a realistic shot at winning in the inaugural year of the contest. If they could transition the remainder of their conventional fleet to emission-less vehicles, the Race could be theirs.The Schedule Challenges of Going ElectricBut becoming the first all-electric fleet in the world requires more than just acquiring electric buses. There are unique operational challenges as well. For one, the limited vehicle range for electric buses would put new constraints on their vehicle schedules. To successfully account for shorter vehicle ranges, an all-electric fleet\u2019s schedule quickly becomes a complex dance of charging stations, driver reliefs, and interlining to make the most efficient schedule possible.Addressing these electric-specific questions is in addition to AVTA\u2019s existing challenge of on-time performance. Many of the agency\u2019s routes run at one-hour headways, so passengers have to wait for an hour to catch a connecting bus if it arrives late at a timepoint.AVTA can now visualize deadhead and layover to help combat on-time performance.Until now, these challenges have been difficult to surmount. The opaque process they had with their operator meant the team had to wait for a month and a half to get blocking and runcut drafts. For most bids, there was enough time for only one or two revisions before the schedule had to be finalized, typically without consulting their drivers first. As a result, their schedules rarely ever changed; and their on-time performance continued to suffer.AVTA knew that in order to to face these challenges \u2014 and to win the Race to Zero \u2014 they\u2019d need a high degree of control over their vehicle schedules.\u201cWhen it comes to electric buses, knowing your range is key. Remix Scheduling will allow us to create a timetable that includes in-route charging time at specific locations.We can block our units while keeping the range in mind, to guarantee performance of the service and successfully make the transition to a full electric fleet.\u201d -Geraldina Romo, PlannerRacing Toward Zero with Remix SchedulingThat\u2019s why the AVTA team is investing in Remix Scheduling. Remix is designed to empower agencies to try many options \u2014 in less time \u2014 for their blocking, runcutting, and rostering outputs.For the first time, Remix has enabled the AVTA team to iterate fast in the face of the needs of their community. \u201cThe graphics allow us to visualize what we\u2019re doing,\u201d says Geraldina Romo, Transit Analyst at AVTA. \u201cWe can see if we\u2019re addressing the feedback that we\u2019ve gotten from the customer.\u201dWith the ability to visually analyze blocking scenarios, and to adjust layover lengths on the fly, AVTA can now build in enough transfer time to combat on-time performance. \u201cWith Remix, you can see the connectivity with the other routes,\u201d Romo says. \u201cYou can see if the drivers are going to make it or not.\u201dBut most importantly, it\u2019s going to improve their workflow overall. \u201cJust having the ability to do the blocking and the runs by ourselves, it\u2019s very empowering,\u201d Romo explains.And in such a competitive environment, perhaps an efficient workflow is the edge AVTA will need to win the Race to Zero.To hear more about AVTA\u2019s challenges and how they\u2019re using Remix Scheduling to surmount them, watch more here:", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Public Transit", "Scheduling Software", "Transportation Planning", "Scheduling"]}, {"title": "How Thugli got Vic Mensa to support a remix they couldn\u2019t share on Soundcloud", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@davidcreates/how-thugli-got-vic-mensa-to-support-a-remix-they-couldn-t-share-on-soundcloud-d953594842ee?source=search_post", "author_name": "David King", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@davidcreates", "publish_date": "2015-06-17", "last_modified_date": "2016-03-07", "readtime": "1.73", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "How Thugli got Vic Mensa to support a remix they couldn\u2019t share on SoundcloudDavid KingFollowJun 17, 2015 \u00b7 2 min readToronto-based DJ/Production duo Thugli have been cranking out Trap remixes of Hip Hop hits over the past three years.

This has lead to a number of opportunities for the duo to work with some of the most established labels and names in the industry as a go-to source for dancefloor smashing remixes. Last year their original track Run This was nominated for a Much Music Video Award (Canadian MTV Video Awards).A few weeks ago they wanted to give away a remix they did of Vic Mensa feat. Kanye West \u2014 U Mad. They were unable to share it on SoundCloud due to recent changes in the Soundcloud takedown process.They decided to try out Receiver as a new way to give free music to their fans and supporters. Once their page was set up at Thugli.com, the remix started to get love from a number of music publications. Over the course of one weekend, they received press from Earmilk, Hypetrak and RunTheTrap, amongst others. The track started to blow up on Twitter, in part due to them asking their fans to tweet the track in exchange for the download. Fans on Twitter and Facebook drove 150% more traffic to their music than the coverage from some of the top music blogs on the web.Since all of these new fans were tweeting about Vic Mensa\u2019s new track, Thugli was able to get Vic Mensa to take notice.He heard it, liked it and supported it which only got more fans to check out Thugli\u2019s site.Receiver\u2019s tools currently focus on leveraging the biggest channels in the world \u2014 Facebook and Twitter \u2014 to evangelize and grow your fan base.

He now works for the Pierce County Public Transportation Benefit Area Corporation, better known as Pierce Transit, which serves the region just south of Seattle and works closely with nearby Sound Transit.As a planner analyst, Max \u201cruns in the background,\u201d as he tells us \u2014 which means furthering Pierce Transit\u2019s forward-thinking usage of data and technology. We talked to Max about the operational and economic benefits of understanding rider habits and what it\u2019s like to plan for a region that\u2019s capturing the runoff of Seattle\u2019s explosive growth.Can you talk about what you work on, and some of the things that you really enjoy? We have a lot of data coming in that\u2019s telling us how our system is performing. We have an AVL system that beams out the location of our buses every minute, and from that we get really rich data on average speed and schedule adherence. That information is fed to third-party data providers or order to provide real-time stop arrival estimates. We have automatic passenger counters so we have a very good idea of what a typical load is on a given bus route at any given time. It\u2019s nice being able to take all that information in and get a picture of what the system looks like, and try to use that data to make decisions on how to optimize our system \u2014 for example, I can see the bus is really crowded between point X and Y at this time. So that makes a case for adding a trip.Of course one of the ways we try to optimize routes is by looking at potentially other new markets that might be nearby that we\u2019re not serving yet, because they haven\u2019t been around very long or we haven\u2019t had the resources to try to consider them. We\u2019re just barely starting to climb out of recession-era steep cuts. We had to cut something like 40 percent of our service hours during the depths of it, so we\u2019re slowly climbing out of that hole and looking back at where we cut to see where we can restore service or if there\u2019s something that we want to try that we haven\u2019t tried yet. That\u2019s really where Remix comes in handy: being able to build a bunch of alternative scenarios really quickly, and getting a rough idea of what those tweaks are going to cost you.It seems like Pierce is doing really innovative work with data and transit planning. We were one of the early adopters of an AVL system that allowed us to push our data up to the web via OneBusAway, a real-time arrival application developed by the University of Washington and now supported by Sound Transit. OneBusAway is functionally similar to the NextBus service seen in other regions but is a non-profit rather than for-profit entity. Most agencies in the Puget Sound region now share their real-time AVL data for free since it enhances the transit rider experience. We\u2019re doing pretty well in that sense.The 150-odd Pierce Transit buses as well as most of the roughly 120 Sound Transit buses operated by PT have automatic passenger counters. Having nearly 100% APC coverage can save you a lot of time in collecting data and analyzing trends and really drilling down into the minutiae of what happens on a particular day. If you only had APCs on a small subset of your fleet, you would have to resort to other data analysis methods or not be able to answer certain questions at all.What kinds of interesting trends have you noticed in your riders? \u201cWe had a situation where we had these 13 30-foot buses that were sitting unused in reserve. These were purchased during the good times mainly to improve the optics of the transit agency, but because they are lower-capacity than a 40-foot bus they make runcutting more difficult since you wouldn\u2019t want to put them on anything but low-ridership trips. Most of the public doesn\u2019t realize that the operating cost savings of a 30-foot bus vs a 40-foot bus are negligible. It\u2019d been years since we routinely used them in regular service.One of the first projects I had when I got here was to take a really thorough look at the historic loads and determine which blocks could support 30-footers without cause undue discomfort for passengers. A block is the piece of work a bus does in a given day and it often includes serving trips on different routes. Looking at the 95 percentile loads of those blocks, we could predict with reasonable accuracy when you\u2019d have a standing load. We were able to find a substantial number of blocks that could reasonably accommodate a 30-footer. This was around the time we were ordering new buses, so we were able to save some money on buses and add service. Not that you\u2019d always want to mix capital and operating budgets, but it in this case it was a win-win and serves as a good example of being able to do something useful with all that data.What do you think the future looks like for Pierce Transit? For the greater Seattle region? For transportation? I am optimistic about our service area down here. I think it\u2019s going to experience a lot of growth in the next couple decades as Seattle becomes saturated. A lot of the things that make Seattle neighborhoods great, those urban design elements, also make Tacoma great. It\u2019s already experiencing some of that boil-over and I think it will continue to do so. The zoning\u2019s already pretty permissive for enhancing density, but it just needs private capital to build it up. If the current generations continue to drive less and not own two cars per household, it looks promising that we can improve our service even more and help build an interesting, dense, and vibrant community. Transit supports that.In doing long range planning, you never know about what random outliers might arise. Relatively few people saw the Internet coming and even fewer could envision how that would impact our society. So who knows what other technological innovation is going to come along and revolutionize transit? When you think about all the work that automakers are doing with self-driving cars, if that ever got into transit that could totally change the way we operate and do business. When you consider the fact that currently 85 percent of operating costs are tied to the human behind the wheel, the amount of service that you could put out on the street would be a lot different. Do you even need a fixed route? Could you apply Uber\u2019s pool model to transit? That\u2019s something to think about and try to plan for if you can. There are so many things that haven\u2019t been figured out. People are willing to share an elevator with a total stranger and that doesn\u2019t even have windows. Would people be willing to trade the security reassurance of having a driver for a huge increase in service?Remix is interviewing planners about their innovative work in public transit.

We talked to Martin, who\u2019s a big football lover himself, about what it takes to prepare a system for the Super Bowl.What\u2019s up with the Super Bowl?It\u2019s coming up fast. We\u2019re basically having meetings every day with various departments at VTA. We meet pretty much on a weekly basis with the Super Bowl host committee and the NFL to go over changes, talk about different aspects of it. It\u2019s amazing how many different parts of it, how many moving parts there are. So Levi\u2019s stadium, in Santa Clara, it\u2019s where the 49ers play, and it\u2019s right on our light rail system. We have a station right next to the stadium called Great America. For all the 49ers games and Taylor Swift concerts, we always run a ton of extra service to help people get to and from the games. On a typical 49ers game, we\u2019ll have about 8\u201310,000 people riding our trains and buses to get to the stadium.So the Super Bowl kind of presents some different challenges compared to a regular 49ers game. For one, obviously, it\u2019s a top-level national security event, so there\u2019s a lot more coordination with security personnel on where you can run trains, additional security sweeps in different areas, and how do you plan around those? They have to check every passenger in multiple locations, so you have to plan how you\u2019re going to get people from the trains to the stadium. Then, after the game, when everyone comes out all at once, how do you get them to the trains, with all the security considerations? It\u2019s a big difference from what we\u2019re used to. Here, we\u2019re limited, for good reason, by security parameters.How many more trains are you going to need to run to make this work?The level of service is not going to be too much higher because you can only fit so many people into the stadium. For a typical 49ers game, we\u2019ll have 11\u201315 extra trains that we\u2019ll run, and maybe 50 or so extra buses. For regular 49ers games, we have five express buses from different parts of the county that a lot of people use, and we have some regular service routes that go near the stadium, too, so we beef those up a little bit. The majority definitely come in on light rail. It\u2019s probably a 90/10 split. For the Super Bowl, we\u2019re looking at about 18\u201320 extra trains and probably closer to 80 to 100 extra buses.What have you had to do to plan for this?It\u2019s mostly going through the service plan, talking through what events are going to be happening. We didn\u2019t realize it, but besides the Super Bowl, there\u2019s months of other events related the game. It\u2019s insane, actually. They\u2019ve had a couple of initial events, like a concert up in San Francisco, and they\u2019re going to have a bunch of stuff in January, leading up to it. We\u2019re pulling it all together in a plan that\u2019ll be comprehensive and address every single day: This is going to happen, this is going to happen, and the transit system is going to look like this, we\u2019re going to run this route with extra buses, create a new shuttle here, add extra train cars onto this line. It\u2019s almost a whole month of events and special service.Has VTA ever had to do anything like this before?We had Wrestlemania here in March. It was really fun! It was a really good preview for the Super Bowl because it was a national event where you had a lot of people flying in from out of town. You have a lot of people unfamiliar with the area that don\u2019t know the transit system well, so you have to plan for that. You have to really understand where the hotels are, where the crowds are coming from \u2014 from Mountain View, or downtown San Jose? We got a good preview.What\u2019s the best way the Super Bowl could go?Everyone gets where they need to go, we have no major security issues, and we just get everyone to the game and back home safely in an efficient manner. I think we\u2019re confident, but it\u2019s always the last-minute things that can be worrisome.It\u2019s Super Bowl 50, too, and the first one that they\u2019ve had in the Bay Area in, like, 30 years. It\u2019s pretty cool to be involved in it.

Even though college is out, the ridership is still up there, so it\u2019s not just college students that are taking it,\u201d says Craig. While the regular 45 takes about 30 minutes and is often late, the 45X leaves three minutes later and makes it from the college to Victorville, and vice-versa, in 18\u201320 minutes.Without Remix, Craig says he \u201cprobably would have just gone out and did several more manual test runs and did it manually. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve always done all the scheduling \u2014 manually. I don\u2019t have any runcutting software. Before, I would use Google Maps to get the timing, and that\u2019s in a car. So what we\u2019d do is go out in a bus and simulate a real run, making stops, loading a wheelchair, to build a schedule. I\u2019ve done that and checked it against Remix, and Remix is quite accurate.\u201dBeyond designing and implementing the 45X, Craig has used Remix to quickly reroute a line in San Bernardino when a stop closed and a new transit center opened. VVTA is also beginning a comprehensive operations analysis, and Craig was able to sketch possible routes for his boss to take to the agency\u2019s board. Those sketches estimated figures for revenue miles, deadhead miles, and how much deadhead time for various scenarios between Needles, Barstow, San Bernardino, and Victorville. Testing just one scenario manually would have required over three hours on a single test drive.\u201cIt\u2019s easy because in Remix, instead of doing the whole route, you can just say, OK, what does it look like if we just go from here to Barstow?\u201d says Craig. \u201cThat\u2019s what I really like about it. I don\u2019t have to actually drive it, or time it. I don\u2019t want to drive all the way, three hours roundtrip, from Needles!\u201dPhoto via Flickr", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Public Transit", "Case Study", "Customer Story", "Vvta"]}, {"title": "Shot!

Remixes. They happen all the time in music, why not in photography?Gary MarloweFollowNov 28, 2015 \u00b7 13 min readI\u2019m interested in many things, but two of my biggest passions happen to be music and photography. As a photographer and writer, I combine the two: taking photos of gigs and portraits of musicians, whilst reviewing concerts and interviewing artists.I\u2019ve been going to gigs since the age of 14 and seen everyone from ABBA and Adele, right through to The xx and ZZ Top and everything inbetween including the likes of Boston, David Bowie, George Michael, Led Zeppelin, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Mott the Hoople, One Direction, Tom Petty, Prince, Queen, Rolling Stones, Royal Blood, Steely Dan and Years & Years.In music, it\u2019s commonplace for artists work to be remixed by someone else, sometimes to give a new spin, sometimes to completely change how it sounds. All the artists listed above have had their work remixed, indeed, it\u2019s rare that a song or an artist doesn\u2019t get the remix treatment.Often, the remixes focus on some aspect of the music that you may have not heard, and on occasion, the remix is actually better than the original. In most cases, they are not collaborations, but someone else\u2019s take on someone else\u2019s work. I\u2019ve long held the view the same creative process should happen in photography.I follow a lot of photographers on Twitter and cannot recall any even mentioning the idea of remixing another photographer\u2019s work, let alone actually doing it. I\u2019ve always maintained the only boundaries with my images are the edges of the frame, an ethos I hope manifests itself throughout my body of work.Unlike those \u2018purist\u2019 photographers where it\u2019s only about what happens in the camera, I\u2019ve long held the view that the most creative part of photography is what you can do with the image after you\u2019ve taken it. Like I\u2019m sure many others do, I often find myself looking at someone else\u2019s photo and thinking, if only they\u2019d cropped it like this, or edited it this way or that.In photography, saying anything other than something positive about another pro\u2019s work seems to be one of those unwritten rules. You rarely, if ever, hear or see one photographer critiquing another\u2019s pictures. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m alone in doing it, but it\u2019s quite common for me to shout at the screen whenever I see a photo that could so clearly be improved, or at least, made to look more interesting.I guess it was only a matter of time before those thoughts turned to actually doing something and the trigger came when I chanced upon a photographer who I must admit I had not heard of before. His name is George Hoyningen-Huene.GHH as I\u2019ll call him, was born in St Petersburg, Russia at the turn of the century (the last century) but spent his life working in Paris, London and in America. His photographic career started in 1926, when aged just 26, he became chief photographer for Vogue in Paris. He went on to have the same role for Harper\u2019s Bazaar in New York, before eschewing fashion and moving to Hollywood in 1946. He also taught photography at the Art Center School in Los Angeles. He died in Los Angeles in 1968. He was 68.Even though GHH must have taken thousands of photos, there aren\u2019t that many available to view online. Of the few that are, a handful caught my attention and I could immediately see how I\u2019d treat them if they were my own images. Indeed, the thinking process is exactly the same as I use when I go through my own shots and visualise what needs to happen to make them look the way I want them to.More often than not, that process is entirely instinctive and doesn\u2019t require any experimentation. I know what\u2019s in my mind, the only thing that sometimes gets in the way is my own technical ability to use the programmes at my disposal, especially when it comes to Photoshop.I make changes to almost every image I create. Far more than the average photographer. Although I have no qualms in improving someone\u2019s appearance by removing spots and blemishes and other skin-based imperfections, and occasionally I\u2019ll remove something (like a microphone) from an image if I feel it\u2019s getting in the way, I never modify a person\u2019s proportions in order to make them look better. It was only natural then to apply the same process to remixing some of GHH\u2019s images.But before I could do anything, I needed to find not just an image that I liked and felt I could improve upon, but one that was available in the quality I needed. And that wasn\u2019t easy. That\u2019s not to say, GHH\u2019s originals weren\u2019t high quality, just that the vast majority of those that have made it online aren\u2019t. To add to the challenge, I also wanted to create a series of remixes that, visually at least, connected with one another.Whether I\u2019ve succeeded in my GHH remixes is of course a matter of opinion. Some will prefer the originals, others may be more partial to mine. I\u2019ll let you decide, but I\u2019ll do it in the same way I do with my own images. I never share the original, only the final version. I\u2019m not interested in people comparing the difference between the two, I only care about their reaction to the finished image. And it\u2019s the same here.Not seeing the original does of course mean it\u2019s hard to judge exactly what I\u2019ve done, or how much of a difference I\u2019ve made compared with what I started with. But remember, in the vast majority of cases, one only ever gets to see the final image and it\u2019s that which we form our opinion on.What would GHH have to say about what I\u2019ve done? Well, being a clearly creative individual, I\u2019d like to think that if he\u2019d had access to the same tools as I do, he too would have experimented with looks that he could not have achieved from the camera alone. Of course, as all photographers were until quite recently, he was limited to some basic modifications in the darkroom and cropping his images when they were printed.I wanted not only to share the first set of remixes, but also give an insight into why I chose those images and why I did what I did to them.So, here\u2019s the very first of those images I worked on. It\u2019s a beachwear shoot that GHH did in 1928 for Italian fashion house Schiaparelli\u2019s pour le Sport collection.Elsa Schiaparelli was a contemporary of Coco Chanel and one of the most prominent fashion designers between the wars. She designed for Mae West, collaborated with Salvador Dali (notably the lobster dress and the shoe hat), but was forced to close her business in 1954. Interestingly, in 2014, the House of Schiaparelli was revived.I think it\u2019s a brilliant image, but GHH\u2019s original was quite a bit larger and was improved greatly just by a simple crop. I love how geometric the image is, I love the lines on her top, on her amazing shoes (and those on the bottom of the stairpost) I love the simplicity of the couples\u2019 pose, their expressions and even how they are holding their cigarettes at exactly the same angle.Apart from the woman\u2019s hair style, it\u2019s a shot that could have been taken yesterday. I could have gone further with my editing, but instictively you know when to stop and in this case, I felt nothing more was needed.This next image was originally taken by GHH in 1929 in the south of France during a swimsuit shoot for Jean Patou.Jean Patou was a French couturier known for his sportswear. The House of Patou was also a pioneer in designer silk ties and one of the first to move into perfumes. Its most famous scent is Joy which, apparently, is the world\u2019s second best-selling perfume after Chanel No 5.The black and white original wasn\u2019t a great resolution, but I just loved the pose. Swimsuits have changed quite a lot since the 20\u2019s, although interestingly, this kind of vintage look seems to be coming back into fashion.Adding the mono colour and GHH\u2019s name gives the image a contemporary twist, as does cropping it to a square format. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been keen on for quite a while now. It\u2019s got nothing to do with Instagram, but everything to do with memories of iconic album covers!My next GHH image is my personal favourite. Apparently, he felt his vision of a remote and elusive feminine ideal was best portrayed by the serenity of classic Greek sculptures, something that clearly influenced this shot. I\u2019ve read it was inspired by a chiton-clad Greek woman from the temple of Zeus at Olympia in the Louvre.The photo itself was taken in 1931 for Vionnet and the model is Sonia Colmer. It\u2019s a beautiful image, from Sonia herself, to the way the dress flows, to how it has been lit. To me, she looks like a classical goddess and once again, the photo could have been taken yesterday.I also think it looks much better in blue than in white. In GHH\u2019s original, the material at the top of the image continued for another couple of feet.This next remix is of Ava Gardner, one of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars. GHH took this portrait of her in 1956, having shifted from being a fashion photographer to becoming a photographer to the stars.Originally from North Carolina, Ava Gardner got her break in 1941 when she visited her sister Beatrice in New York. Beatrice\u2019s husband, a professional photographer, took her portrait, which he displayed in the window of his photography studio on Fifth Avenue where \u2014 in true Hollywood style \u2014 it was spotted by an MGM talent scout. Unlike most of her contemporaries, Ava Gardner was her real name, a name she kept despite being married three times, first to Mickey Rooney and lastly to Frank Sinatra.As a portrait, it\u2019s quite straightforward. By cropping it to a square format and removing the off the shoulder dress she was wearing, the image now becomes even more provocative as it appears she might be topless.This next one looks like it was taken during the same shoot in 1931 for Vionnet. It\u2019s not quite as interesting an image, but when I found a high res version, I had to remix it.Known as the \u201carchitect among dressmakers\u201d Madeleine Vionnet founded her fashion house in Paris in 1912, but was forced to close it just two years later due to the onset of WW1. In the Twenties she became enormously successful, although she was always in the shadow of her more flamboyant contemporaries Coco Chanel and Elsa Schiaparelli. Drawing inspiration from Greek art, Vionnet created garments that clung to the shape of the body with a fluidity that echoed its movements. She is also credited with inventing the bias cut, , but perhaps one of the most interesting aspects about her was her tireless fight against plagiarism. Vionnet protected her \u201ccoup en bias\u201d from imitations with a copyright and in 1921 she won two lawsuits against forgers that made legal history.So those are my GHH remixes, all celebrating a talented photographer by giving his images a modern twist almost half a century after he had died. I\u2019ve struggled to find any others that I liked or, more importantly, that were of sufficient resolution that I could work with, but I did find one other of his portraits that I thought was so iconic I just had to do something with it.It\u2019s a portrait of the Ukrainian-born dancer, Serge Lifar.Serge Lifar was a huge star in the world of ballet. From 1929 until the outbreak of WW2, he was of the ballet master of the Paris Op\u00e9ra Ballet which he not only re-established as a leading ballet company, but enhanced the position of male dancers in a company long dominated by ballerinas.I don\u2019t know when this picture was taken, but it looks like it was at a theatre performance. Apart from those eyes, what I like about it most is just how modern it looks. He could be a fashion model wearing a hoodie!So those are my six homages to George Hoyningen-Huene. I\u2019d love to do more, but until I find better source material, these are all I can do for now.Doing them inspired me to look for other images I could remix, but it\u2019s not easy finding ones that fulfil the criteria I\u2019m looking for. So far, I\u2019ve found three more, although the first is not a photo, but an artwork. Well, it\u2019s a photo of an artwork and it\u2019s one that\u2019s only recently been discovered and attributed to a very famous artist.That artist is MC Escher, someone whose work has enthralled me ever since my schooldays. Not only do I have every book published about him, I\u2019ve been to the Escher museum in Den Haag, Holland, and an exhibition of his work in Rome. Many years ago, I even spent a few memorable hours in the vaults of the Gemuntemuseum in Den Haag looking at their collection of unexibited works and Escher memorabilia.This particular Escher image was only verified as his in 2015 and is therefore one few will ever have seen before. Unlike most of his more famous works, this is not a mathematical puzzle or a trick of the eye, but a rather simple sketch (or etching) of an Italian hill village.It\u2019s called Montecelio, and judging by contemporary photos of the place, it looks pretty much the same today as it did when Escher drew it in 1924. His original is of course in black and white, but by giving it a vibrant yellow makeover I think it brings it to life.Later in his career, Escher would make a name for himself with his fantastical images that defied the imagination. He of course had an extraordinary imagination and many of his images look like they were the result of computer manipulation. One can only wonder what he would have achieved had he had access to today\u2019s technology! It would have certainly enabled him to have been much more prolific as his etching process was both extraordinarily time-consuming and, once committed, couldn\u2019t be altered.Remixing is of course all about altering an original, changing it in some way, that makes it different. Both these next two images are contemporary, taken by photographers who are still around today. I did try to contact both of them to advise what I was doing and hopefully get their approval) but neither responded.Because I openly acknowledge both of them (on the image and whenever I\u2019ve shared it on social media) I took the view that, if it were me in their position, I wouldn\u2019t have a problem if another photographer did something similar to any of my images that are accessible online.This is a wonderful portrait of the singer Ella Eyre by Andres Reynaga. I think it was originally taken for a magazine shoot. I\u2019ve shot Ella numerous times on stage and I\u2019ve even interviewed her twice and I know she has fabulous hair. Andres\u2019 shot captures it in all its glory, but also captures Ella in a dream-like state, with her eyes closed.It\u2019s a great shot. It looks good in colour, but to me it looks even better in blue. I\u2019ve cropped away around half the original image, so the focus is on her hair and (because the original had a lot of space around it) I was able to shift her from the centre to one side.Continuing the blue theme, is this one of Taylor Swift.The original was taken at an awards show by Frazer Harrison (a celebrity photographer based in Hollywood just like GHH himself). I\u2019ve not been able to find Frazer\u2019s original, but I\u2019ve seen another similar shot that\u2019s clearly from the same sequence.As usual with red carpet shots, the background is full of logos, so it\u2019s no surprise someone had already cropped it when I found it. I cropped it even more because I felt it would look even better and because the resolution was so good I could.To me, it was all about those eyes. In the original, they were somewhat lost, in mine, especially with the blue tones, they really come alive. The original was in colour and the background was bright yellow. I did try this in yellow, but much preferred it in blue. I think it would make for a really eye-catching album cover!As and when I find more images to remix, I\u2019ll add them to this collection. In the meantime, I\u2019d be interested in your views on remixing, in particular what you think of my efforts here. I\u2019d also love to know if any other photographers are doing something similar with other people\u2019s work. If you are, I\u2019d really like to see what you\u2019ve done.Notes: Remember, unlike my own photography, all these images were not created from high resolution source material, but from photos that can be found on the internet. Obviously, the higher the resolution, the more an image can take modification, especially in terms of cropping. If you\u2019re not familiar with my work, virtually every image I create includes a text caption. For me, text is an integral part of my look.Disclaimer: All these images were taken by the photographer they have been credited to, or in Escher\u2019s case from his original artwork. They or their estates will almost certainly own the copyright. All I have done is remix them. I am not selling these images nor in any way am I attempting to pass them off as mine. Without the original photographs, there would be nothing.Gary Marlowe | Images Out Of The OrdinaryNovember 2015Follow me on TwitterSee more of my images at 500px", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Photography", "Remix", "Art", "Creativity"]}, {"title": "Webinar Recap: Using Data to Drive Your City\u2019s Mobility Goals", "post_link": "https://blog.remix.com/webinar-recap-using-data-to-drive-your-citys-mobility-goals-cffa382db91c?source=search_post", "author_name": "Remix", "author_link": "https://blog.remix.com/@remix123", "publish_date": "2019-04-16", "last_modified_date": "2019-04-16", "readtime": "2.00", "claps": 6, "voters": 2, "content": "Webinar Recap: Using Data to Drive Your City\u2019s Mobility GoalsRemixFollowApr 16 \u00b7 3 min readAs cities embrace new mobility, they must ensure that transportation remains equitable and safe for all.

In the last few years, Bayou Park, a 160-acre natural space, was renovated, a revitalization of the downtown historic district kicked off, more multi-unit housing was built than in Oakland, CA (my current city), and a surge of restaurants and bars sprung up across the city. On top its resurgence on the list of cool cities to live in, Houston Metro built out three rail lines (completed in May 2015) and rolled out a System Reimagining in August 2015.A system overhaul (similar to what was implemented in Houston) happens irregularly at transit agencies, and rarely do they decide to approach it the way Houston did. Typically, service changes are done through a comprehensive operational analysis, followed by an intensive implementation plan of incremental changes over a lengthy amount of time. Metro implemented the entire system redesign in August 2015\u2026overnight. Nearly every bus route was altered with the goal of creating a high-frequency, seven days a week system that increased access to people and jobs.Their previous system had 11 lines of high frequency transit lines, defined as service with 15 minute headways or better. Only 25% of the ridership base had access to frequent service under this network. In essence, if you were a Metro rider in July 2015, and lived in Hispanic Houston, you would have had access to one high frequency route. With the redesign, someone living in the same neighborhood now has access to four high frequency routes.On August 16, 2015, the new service redesign enabled riders to travel even further by increasing frequencies, implementing route modifications, and ensuring the transit system served demand. The change meant that 72% of the ridership base now had access to 22 lines with frequent service, seven days a week. The results of this newfound freedom of mobility can be seen below in the travel time visualization.Now, Houston\u2019s high frequency transit network is something to be proud of \u2014 especially in comparison to other cities that boast great networks. Houston Metro board member, Christof Spieler, presented on the power of the system reimagining at the Remix Conference in October 2015, showing Houston\u2019s new system in comparison with transit greats like Portland.Next to these same peer cities, Houston boasts the best high frequency network on weekends \u2014 further helping boost its transit credibility ( and quite frankly, making it a great place to visit without lugging a 2 ton car around).What are the actual results? Based on demographic data pulled from Remix, the people and jobs within 1/4 mile of a bus stop is significant for each line (see table). These numbers are pulled for each route and may have overlapping populations (especially in downtown). In aggregate, the redesign resulted in an increase in access to jobs, in higher frequency. On the human level, that translates to a more reliable transit network with the ability to show up to a bus stop unplanned and know a bus will arrive shortly. Newly released November 2015 ridership shows an 11% increase on all fixed route services \u2014 proving riders are now comfortable with the new system and even more can now use the system.I applaud Houston Metro for the herculean effort required to successfully implement this scale of a redesign. They\u2019ve shown a commitment to better transit and their community by allocating their resources to productive routes. They have sent a strong message to transit agencies across the U.S., proving that having a vision has significant benefits to existing and potential riders. In fact, CAT (Clemson, SC) and COTA (Columbus, OH) have taken the bait and are now both undergoing TSRs.Curious about your network\u2019s access to population and jobs?

We do so by taking writing that reflects the often underrepresented perspectives of ordinary people and then transforming them into internet-friendly webcomics. Our previous policy around what types of writing we choose to illustrate was that it a) should not have have already gone viral on the internet, and b) should not be penned by a Famous Person. This rule was based on the formula behind our very first comic, which remains, two years later, one of our most popular comics.But there was another reason for this rule: I was worried about being a free rider. My internal logic was, if I illustrated an already-viral or Famous Person essay, then I would just be profiting off of its success rather than adding to it. I would, I feared, only be siphoning off attention to myself in the process. In contrast, choosing to illustrate undiscovered writing was much more straightforward. There, I would be shining a light on overlooked pieces of writing and could do no wrong.But when our recent comic about the legislative council elections in Hong Kong went viral, I was forced to rethink our policy.Our comic above was based on a teen\u2019s heart-wrenching letter about the September elections in Hong Kong. In it, he laments his inability to vote as a minor, decries the decline of the city in the hands of its pro-establishment (loosely speaking: conservative, pro-China) parties, and urges his fellow citizens to go out and vote for the pro-democratic opposition. By the time I saw it, a photographed copy of the letter had already gone viral on Facebook (19,198 shares) and Instagram, and even received mainstream media coverage.In this case, I broke my own rule around illustrating an already-viral essay by justifying it as an act of translation. I had found no mention of the letter in the English-language press or even on social media. So by translating it, I would be bringing it to a new audience (a value add). As my friend Tricia reminded me, getting that message across to the English-speaking audience in Hong Kong was definitely a worthy cause. After some thought, I begrudgingly agreed. I figured the comic would do well within English-speaking circles at least, while being ignored by the Chinese speakers because they had all seen it already.I was wrong.My bilingual, comic version of the letter amassed 7,616 shares and 7,400 likes on Facebook, eventually reaching 1,058,393 people there. (It was published on the Inmedia, the home for all of my Hong Kong-based Add Oil Comics.) While it did not surpass the audience numbers of the original latter, I was still astounded by how far and wide it spread. Furthermore, Chinese-speaking commenters were not complaining about having seen it already, they were (for the most part) supportive of its message.Not only was I shocked by its success, I was also pleasantly surprised that the comic was adding to the conversation, and that the letter was reaching new audiences. More importantly, I did not feel like a free rider. So I took a long, hard look in the mirror to reconsider my rule around already-viral essays. In doing so, I noticed that I had already broken my own rule at one key moment in the past.That time I broke my own rule and swept it under the rugThe above comic, my first on transgender experiences, was based on a Tumblr post that had already garnered 416,822 notes. This comic, which I decided to draw on a whim, became the founding pillar of our third topic at Add Oil Comics. Its sudden success (2,558 notes) enabled me to connect to the trans community on Tumblr, and prompted me to start a series of comics about transgender experiences, a practice that I continue to this day. Somewhere along the way though, I\u2019d forgotten that I drew from such a popular and widely-shared source of material.Having ignored my own rule on these two key instances is reason enough to overturn it. Points in favor of continuing to remix writing that\u2019s already gone viral include:Repeating the message again is always useful.There\u2019s no such thing as a piece of writing that Everyone has seen.Illustrating and/or translating a an essay is adding value.While the only point against remixing already-viral writing is:I might draw attention away from the original.But there\u2019s been little evidence of that within our work at Add Oil Comics, particularly because we usually publish a comic 1\u20132 weeks after the release of the original. So in effect, the rule boils down to my own personal anxiety around being a free rider.Ultimately, Add Oil Comics\u2019 goal is to raise awareness around social issues and movements by amplifying the often under-represented voices of ordinary people. Working with writing that\u2019s already gone viral does not detract from this goal, and has, based on our experiences, added to the conversation and original message. This is why I am revising our previously-unspoken policy about illustrating already-viral writing. We will be pursuing it as a legitimate source of content moving forward.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Comics", "Remix", "Creative Process"]}, {"title": "Page Titles, Path Remix, API Hotness, and Your Own Logo.

This article updates that discussion by incorporating developments since then. It also folds in discussion of the economic moats that Facebook has developed around its business. Large segments of this article are exactly identical to the post that was published by Tekedia in 2011.IntroductionThe primary purpose of this post was to demonstrate how one might apply the Business Model Canvas in trying to understand Facebook\u2019s business model. Assuming we understand the business model, I then apply the Economic Moats framework to thinking about Facebook.It is a fair critique to accuse me of playing \u201cMonday-Morning Quarterback\u201d since it is easy to pick on an extreme success like Facebook and use it as an example. However, from my perspective as an early stage venture capitalist who is basically teaching himself the trade that critique ignores at least one benefit of this kind of case study \u2014 mainly that it is useful for trying to recreate the path I might have followed in thinking about Facebook had I been introduced to Mark Zuckerberg in 2004 when he was raising his first outside capital from investors. Think of this as the self-taught early stage venture capitalists\u2019 version of working in a science laboratory, trying to recreate the experiments and reproduce the results that have brought us the advances of the past. Such work is what lays the groundwork for original scientific discoveries in the future.Also, I should point out that I do not have direct access to inside-information about Facebook\u2019s early days. This case is constructed on the basis of information, reports, and data that are in the public domain.Okay, with those disclaimers out of the way . . . On with our case study.According to Michael Rappa; \u201cIn the most basic sense, a business model is the method of doing business by which a company can sustain itself \u2014 that is, generate revenue. The business model spells-out how a company makes money by specifying where it is positioned in the value chain.\u201d Alex Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur say that; \u201cA business model describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers and captures value.\u201dWhat problem does Facebook solve?My son\u2019s paternal grandparents live in Nigeria, as does his uncle \u2014 my younger brother. His aunt \u2014 my younger sister lives in Ghana. His grandfather has never met him, nor have his uncle and aunt. His grandmother paid him a visit for three months soon after he was born. He was only two months old when she visited.I had been asking myself the question; \u201cHow can I ensure that his grandparents, his uncle, his aunt and other members of his extended family do not miss out on his childhood entirely?\u201d My desire to answer that question in a comprehensive way helped me to overcome my objections to Facebook. I joined Facebook in November 2009.Facebook enables its users to connect with one another through the company\u2019s social networking online portal. Users connect socially with their \u201cfriends\u201d in a \u201csocial-network\u201d to share status updates, articles, videos, music, photographs and other content through Facebook.Facebook\u2019s users can interact with one another in a number of different ways:Users can connect directly as \u201cfriends\u201d \u2014 this allows the highest degree and freedom of interaction subject to privacy controls that each user can put in place to govern their activity on Facebook.Users can connect to one another as subscribers/followers \u2014 this is a one-way connection. Subscribers will see and can comment on the public posts by the person to whom they have subscribed. This feature was a recent addition when I wrote the original post in 2011.Users can interact with one another through Facebook Messenger, an instant messaging app that has evolved since the function was first introduced to Facebook\u2019s users in 2008.Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012 Instagram built a social network for sharing photos.Facebook acquired WhatsApp in 2014. WhatsApp is a mobile instant messaging app that is popular in developing markets.Facebook acquired Oculus VR in 2014. Oculus VR is a virtual reality technology startup.Founded in 2004, Facebook\u2019s mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected. People use Facebook to stay connected with friends and family, to discover what\u2019s going on in the world, and to share and express what matters to them.Source: Facebook, as of March 2016The following list highlights some of Facebook\u2019s features:User profiles and homepages \u2014 users post status updates on their homepage or wall.Messages, Chat and Social Hangouts (video chat).Photos + Videos \u2014 users can tag one another in photos and videos.Games + Apps \u2014 people can play games with one another, or share other information through specialized apps.Groups and Pages \u2014 people can form a group or create a page for sharing information around an issue of interest.Events \u2014 people can use Facebook to plan events and invite others to participate.Credits \u2014 this is the virtual currency for transactions on Facebook.Reports in the press suggest that Facebook has about 800 million active users around the world. An active user is a user who has returned to Facebook\u2019s website within 30 days.ComScore reports that 82% of the world\u2019s 1.2 billion online population participates in some form of social networking. Social networking eats up 20% of the time people spend online. Facebook\u2019s users account for 75 percent of the time spent on social networking websites. Facebook\u2019s users also account for more than 14 percent of the time people spend online around the world.December 2015 Update:Monthly Active Users: 1.59 billion monthly active users as of December 31, 2015Daily Active Users: 1.04 billion daily active users on average for December 2015Mobile Monthly Active Users: 1.44 billion mobile monthly active users as of December 31, 2015Mobile Daily Active Users: 934 million mobile daily active users on average for December 2015How Does Facebook Make Money?Facebook does not charge its users a sign-up or monthly fee. So, how does Facebook make money if users like me get to use it for free? There are three sources of revenue for Facebook;Advertising \u2014 Facebook can deliver targeted ads to its users based on information that they provide during sign-up or as they interact with their friends.Games + Apps \u2014 Facebook is paid a 30 percent fee by companies that develop games and applications for its user base. This fee is applied to in-game or in-app sales.Virtual Goods \u2014 Facebook earns a slice of revenue from the sale of virtual goods to its users.Reports in the press speculated that Facebook\u2019s 2011 revenue would be in the neighborhood of $4.5 Billion. Advertising should account for the majority of that amount, followed by revenue from games and apps. Virtual goods account for only a small portion of Facebook\u2019s revenues.March 2016 Update: Revenue for the full year 2015 was $17.93 billion, representing an increase of 44% over revenue for the full year 2014.The Business Model Canvas \u2014 The Building Blocks of Facebook\u2019s Business ModelNote: Business Model Generation was not published till July 2010, nearly 6 years after thefacebook.com launched. Still, using the business model canvas to analyze Facebook\u2019s business Model is instructive.Customer SegmentsMass market \u2014 any one that uses the internet and wants to connect and socialize with family, friends and other people that are online.Advertisers \u2014 big, medium and small companies that wish to advertise to the hundreds of millions of people that spend time on social network websites. Reports estimate that people spend about 3 to 4 times as much time on Facebook as they spend on Google.Developers \u2014 apps, social games, and virtual goods.Value Proposition(s)Enable users to connect and share with family, friends and other people with whom they share a common interest.ChannelsWebsiteMobile AppCustomer RelationshipsNetwork effects \u2014 users will gravitate to the social network where most of their friends are already users.Relatively high switching costs \u2014 users are less likely switch to a competitor after sharing a lot of content on Facebook.Revenue StreamsAdvertising \u2014 fees generated from online display banner ads delivered to users through Facebook.com. There are probably two or three different categories of advertising. Not entirely clear if this will work, but the team has been pitching this to advertisers since it was two months old. Might need to verify this assumption with someone in the advertising industry.Facebook Credits \u2014 30 percent share of in-app and in-game transactions.Virtual goods \u2014 straight virtual goods sales not connected to use of an app or a game by the user.Key ResourcesPeople \u2014 employees, and Facebook\u2019s more than 800 million active users.Technology \u2014 software, servers and other cloud-based services that Facebook must purchase from other companies to support its operations.Brand \u2014 people have to trust in what Facebook represents.Key ActivitiesDeveloping and improving the Facebook platform \u2014 both the frontend user experience and backend data processing capacity. The company was reported to have started working on proprietary server designs to support its operations \u2014 reports suggested the company might be worried about the speed at which conventional server designs allow it to serve content to its millions of daily users.Key PartnersThird party developers \u2014 apps, games and other features to enable people connect and share with one another using Facebook\u2019s platform.Cost StructureEmployees \u2014 Facebook reportedly has between two and three thousand employees spread across offices in 15 countries. The company seems to be preparing for a burst of growth in the size of its workforce.Technology \u2014 server maintenance, software latency and optimization issues; this will continue to be a concern as people generate and share more and more content using smartphones.The company says that more than 50% of its more than 800 million active users log onto Facebook on any given day. Nielsen estimated in a report on social media that American internet users collectively spent more than 53 billion minutes on Facebook in May 2011. The average user has 130 Facebook friends. The company also says people interact with more than 900 million objects on the website and that the average user is connected to 80 community pages, groups and events. On the average day Facebook\u2019s users upload 250 million photos. Facebook is available in 70 languages, and 300,000 users helped to translate the site by using Facebook\u2019s translations app. On the average day, Facebook\u2019s users install apps 20 million times. During the average month, half a billion people use an app on Facebook or experience the Facebook platform on other websites (e.g. to share this story from Tekedia with your friends on Facebook). In all more than 7 million apps and websites are integrated with the Facebook platform. There are 475 mobile operators globally working to promote and deploy Facebook\u2019s mobile products through their mobile networks and on their mobile devices (for example Facebook\u2019s Android, iOS and Blackberry apps). More than 350 million active users currently access Facebook through a mobile device.Facebook was launched in February 2004. As the preceding paragraph clearly demonstrates, the overarching elements of Facebook\u2019s business model that we have discussed have led it to unbelievable success. This success has occurred in spite of the fact that Facebook was not the very first social networking company. MySpace launched in August 2003, and before that Friendster was founded in 2002. Classmates.com, SixDegrees.com and Makeoutclub.com preceded Friendster. One may argue that Facebook benefited from technological advancements that its predecessors could not exploit. One may also argue that Facebook launched at a time when millions of people had become accustomed to the concept of social networking. I suspect there\u2019s a lot of truth in both of those arguments. However, I would also argue that Facebook did a better job of understanding the intricacies of its business model better than its predecessors, and then executing that business model more effectively than any of its predecessors. Put those three arguments together and one can see that Facebook\u2019s phenomenal growth is not completely outside the realm of possibility.Facebook Menlo Park HQ (Image Credit: Facebook)Economic Moats AnalysisI am now going to pretend that I have travelled back in time, to September 2004. As fortune would have it I am a reasonably well-liked early stage VC who invests in startups raising their very first round of capital from institutional investors. Someone I know has introduced me to the founder of The Facebook; and describes it as \u201ca web directory that the college-kids are going crazy about.\u201d I agree to meet in two weeks, when some time opens up on my schedule. In the meantime I start doing some cursory reading about this \u201cthing.\u201dThe issues I am most concerned about are, in order of priority;First, how do I know that thefacebook.com has proven that its value proposition will hold? Around that time reports in the press highlighted how addictive thefacebook.com had become to its users. Here are some examples:Even those who don\u2019t know why they love Thefacebook can\u2019t stay away.It\u2019s a stupid, stupid website, but I am completely addicted,\u201d freshman Emily Bruckner said. \u201cI just go around and look at all of my friends and see who they\u2019re friends with. It\u2019s like a contest to see who has the most friends.Source: Thefacebook.com Opens to Duke Students, Duke Chronicle; April 14, 2004.Value Proposition \u2014 The bottomline: Users love thefacebook.com, and there is plenty room for growth. The are millions of college students around the world that thefacebook could target as users.Second, do I have a sense of how the team intends to grow the business? Will the team\u2019s ideas about growth work? Based on reports in the press, it appears thefacebook is growing rapidly, and so I have to assume the team has figured what it will take to grow within the market on which it has chosen to focus initially. There may yet be some work to do here, but so far so good. Each user is encouraged to invite some friends upon first signing up for thefacebook, and the website also suggests people that new users might know who are already on the site. Friendster is doing well within the general population, so there\u2019s one example of how thefaceboook too might grow beyond college-campuses . . . when that makes sense.Growth \u2014 The bottomline: The team seems to have figured out a method to accelerate growth on college campuses. That\u2019s a good sign. There may be a few outstanding questions, but this is probably a good point at which to consider making a investment if growth can continue to accelerate.Third, and finally . . . How does the team believe thefacebook.com will make money? This is a critical question since it speaks to thefacebook.com\u2019s future prospects for becoming a self-sustaining entity. The team has been pitching itself as an online marketing service to advertisers . . . It will be interesting to see how advertisers react to this.Revenue \u2014 The bottomline: Murky. Not clear if this will work. But Google is having success selling ads online through its Content Targeting Advertising. So not out of the realm of possibility. But no definitive answers at hand.Economic moats help early stage technology startups preserve and enhance the advantages they enjoy over their competitors as time goes on their business model matures. There are five ways in which a startup can build an economic moat; Network Effects, Switching Costs, Efficient Scale or Cost Advantages, Intangibles, and Brand. Note, that I discuss \u201cbrand\u201d under the heading of \u201cIntangibles\u201d but it stands alone as one of the 5 sources of an economic moat.Brand: High. Becoming known as the platform for college students for intra- and inter- college social networking. Highly sought after by students at colleges where it is yet to launch a community.Network Effects: High. Platform gets more useful for users as more of their friends sign-on to become users.Efficient Scale or Cost Advantages: High. Users invite friends. Word-of-mouth seems to be spreading and helping keep costs of acquiring new users relatively low.Switching Costs or Buyer Lock-in: Undetermined. Need more data. But should increase as people interact more and more on thefacebook.com. Described as addictive. Wonder how long that addictive quality will last. Need to get better understanding of user-perception of value.Intangibles:Intellectual Property: None necessary right now, but might be needed in the future to solve technical problems caused by growth. TBD.Research and Development: Need to figure out revenue model. Also, what problems has Friendster run into that might be relevant for thefacebook.com? How is the team thinking about this?Culture and Management: TBD. Young team, college students. Mark has prior experience building social-networking applications.Conclusion: So, would I have invested? I do not know. There is more that goes into a decision like that one than the preceding analysis. However, at first blush there are no \u201csmoking-gun\u201d reasons not to take a closer look. To avoid saying no prematurely at this stage it would help to keep the following lessons in mind \u2014 they are adapted from Andrew Chen\u2019s discussion about his decision to pass on making an early stage investment in Facebook when he had the opportunity to do so after he convinced himself that \u201cFacebook would never be a billion dollar company.\u201d Note: I wrote about this in April 2012 in a post that was published at Tekedia. The following discussion is adapted from that post.Lack of experience and lack of knowledge are two distinctly different things. Do not confuse them with one another. Pass on making an investment because of a lack of knowledge, do not pass only because of a lack of experience.Do not take solace in data and statistics without first verifying that such analyses are relevant within the given context. Data and statistics often inspire unjustified confidence, but calculations are useless if what you are calculating is wrong, irrelevant or simply inapplicable to the startup\u2019s situation and future markets.Do your own homework. Treat data and statistics from others with extreme skepticism. At the very least, try to interpret third party data based on your own analyses.By definition, your past experience might be useless in understanding the most promising startups that you will encounter. Start from first-principles. Understand the fundamentals of what the startup is trying to do before you leap to conclusions grounded in your past experience. Don\u2019t let your professional history and learned logic become a hindrance.Business models matter, but execution matters more than the relative attractiveness or unattractiveness of the business model that exists at the time you encounter and early stage startup.Heuristics are useful, but only up to a point. See the point on \u201cpast experience\u201d above.Keep an open mind, peel away the layers . . . Lack of conformity with the stereotypes you have become familiar with is an insufficient reason for passing on a startup.Lastly, set all the analyses aside and spend some time thinking about what would happen if the team succeeds in accomplishing what it is setting out to do.

In 1990, more than 4,000; in 2000, almost 15,000. And in 2010, there were 22,750 remixes released, an increase of more than 450% in twenty years. Not surprisingly, as that number has leapt up, remixes also have come to represent a much larger share of what\u2019s being released: in 1983, they accounted for 2% of all releases; 7% in 1990; 17% in 2000; until, by 2010, a staggering 20% of all releases were remixes.How did we get to the point where a one-hit-wonder band from the \u201990s like Marcy Playground can release an entire album of remixes made by fans? Why is everyone a DJ these days, and why does every band in the world have to have a remix? The short answer is \u201cbecause they can.\u201d As technology has advanced, so has the remix. It started in Jamaica in the \u201960s with dub effects, emerged in America through disco and the 12\" mix, helped to create rap through the power of their sound systems, exploded in the \u201990s with the maxi-CD, and became participatory (and ubiquitous) with digital mashups. At each step of the way, the particular kind of technology available shaped the nature of that moment\u2019s remixes.VERSIONING SOUNDUsed as a verb, \u201cremixing\u201d has been possible (and practiced) ever since the existence of multi-track recording. At the dawn of sound recording, a song had to be recorded directly to the form it would eventually be heard, and there was no way of extracting just the bass or guitar part without taking all the other parts with it. But once sound could be recorded to 4 or more tracks (from which it\u2019s then \u201cmixed down\u201d into the final, combined form you hear), engineers could return to the working versions of songs and \u201cremix\u201d them: make the guitar louder, take out all of the vocals, even make the track shorter or longer.This isn\u2019t to say that recorded sound couldn\u2019t be manipulated prior to the advent of multi-tracking. Most notable here is William Burroughs\u2019 \u201ccut-up\u201d technique, which took a Dadaist trick of cutting up words to rearrange text and then applied it to the magnetic tape on which recordings used to reside. Musicians like Brian Eno and Genesis P-Orridge used the technique to clip sections, rearrange them and place them in a new sequence \u2014 Burroughs characterized this as a \u201cmethod for altering reality.\u201d Recording engineers did this too, but they called it an \u201cedit,\u201d and they used it not to alter reality, but as a way to, for instance, shorten a long track for radio play by removing an instrumental section or extra verse.As a noun, though, \u201cremix\u201d implies something a little different than either re-balancing a song or re-arranging its parts. Its use connotes a track that has been fundamentally transformed, either in form or content, into something new. There\u2019s a self-consciousness about remixes: while a radio edit is intended to make the same musical experience available in a different context, a remix is intended to be a new musical experience entirely.As such, the first recordings that could be called \u201cremixes\u201d were produced in Jamaica in the 1960s. The island\u2019s extremely strong local music culture enabled a tight interplay between the people who made records and the people who listened and danced to them. As DJ/producers like Lee \u201cScratch\u201d Perry saw that crowds were interested in longer musical experiences than they could provide with the single format (the 7\" vinyl disc on which singles came was generally only able to hold four minutes\u2019 worth of music without suffering a drop in sound quality), they produced new versions which they referred to as \u201cversions.\u201d What makes these remixes is that, besides dropping out the vocals to concentrate on instrumental sections, producers started adding new material to better capture the energy dancers were looking for, both in the form of new instrumental parts and effects (like long echoes) put on the existing parts.There were economic factors, too. Since Jamaican producers tended to be owner-operators, both recording and distributing their own music, they had access to the multi-track masters at a time when American musicians didn\u2019t. In the United States (and other industrialized countries), the master recordings were owned by the record company, making it much more difficult for artists to get their hands on their own recordings, let alone legally release remixes. With ownership resting on the business side, there was an impetus to see recordings as \u201cfinished\u201d for American musicians that didn\u2019t necessarily exist for these Jamaican producers. And since recording equipment was enormously expensive and generally only available in commercial studios where artists would have to pay for time, American musicians simply weren\u2019t able to remix their material in the way people like King Tubby could.WE CATCH \u2019EM ON THE FLIPThe remix wouldn\u2019t have happened in America without the 12\" single. Though the form predates disco, that was the sound that made the remix what we know today. \u201cNew York remixers \u2014 many of them DJs \u2014 weren\u2019t really influenced by Jamaica, in part because New York dance crowds demanded music that was much more up-tempo than reggae and dub,\u201d wrote Tim Lawrence, author of Love Saves the Day: American Dance Music Culture, 1970\u20131979, in an email interview with me.\u201cJamaican remixes usually involved the producer-DJs taking out elements from the original track and placing greater emphasis on the drums and the bass via a process of subtraction, but the records weren\u2019t extended. New York remixers would also strip records down, but they were also focused on drama and an idea of a journey, so they would often retain complete elements from the original and would then take the record \u2018somewhere else\u2019 by stripping out certain sections and extending others. New Yorkers developed their own remix technique in almost complete isolation and apparently without outside influence for something like seven years.\u201dThe first American remixer, it\u2019s generally agreed, is a guy named Tom Moulton, about whom Lawrence writes about extensively in his book. Moulton was interested in finding ways to provide different party experiences to New Yorkers, and experimented with a lot of different techniques, including cutting up existing recordings, as people had been doing for years. Lawrence identifies the first of these as a remix of Don Downing\u2019s \u201cDreamworld,\u201d which Moulton produced in 1974. Moulton\u2019s signal innovation, though, was to put such remixes on a 12\" disc, the format usually used for full albums.In preparing his remix of Al Downing\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ll Be Holding On,\u201d which took a three-minute soul song and extended it to almost seven minutes long, \u201cMoulton\u2019s assistant happened to press up on a 12\u201d blank because he\u2019d run out of 7\"s,\u201d writes Lawrence. \u201cMoulton was stunned to hear the power of hearing the music\u2019s grooves spread out over the larger disc.\u201d (Without getting too technical, the less time you\u2019re trying to fit onto a disc, the louder it can be.) The success of this technique led to the first commercially released remix, Double Exposure\u2019s \u201cTen Percent,\u201d in 1976.While these were a hit with dancers and DJs, labels didn\u2019t feel the same way. As Lawrence put it in his email: \u201cThe dance market turned out to have quite different values, with dancers much more interested in hearing a brilliantly re-structured twelve-inch single than listening to a bunch of catchy singles plus extra cuts on an album. That meant that twelve-inch singles didn\u2019t necessarily translate into album sales, and from that point on the music industry (and especially the music majors) were always skeptical of the format.\u201dTAKES YOU BACK TO THE PASTNevertheless, the form persisted in a new genre: hip hop. Jamaican ideas of remixing formed the foundations of the genre, and the initial impetus for rap was very similar to that of dub and disco remixes: Dancers wanted more instrumental sections to dance to and less singing. But with hip hop, MCs picked up the talkover mic and started to add their own vocals. And with parties often happening outside established clubs in outdoor or otherwise improvised spaces, DJs like Kool Herc gained influence as much for the power of their sound systems as their DJing skills. Disco remixes happened because their vinyl was louder; rap happened, in some small part, because DJs\u2019 speakers were louder, making loud vocals an attraction party promoters could provide.At first, hip hop remixes followed a similar pattern to the disco remix, with the instrumental portion of the song altered while the vocals were either cut up or left intact. In an email, Andrew Nosnitsky, who writes about rap for a bunch of different places including The Wire, told me there were good economic reasons for this. \u201cIf a record wasn\u2019t connecting at radio they\u2019d give it a different beat and try again. If it wasn\u2019t hitting on the West Coast, they\u2019d get a Warren G remix, if underground mix shows weren\u2019t playing it they\u2019d get it a Beatminerz mix, if they wanted to expand to dance markets they\u2019d push a CJ Mackintosh hip house mix.\u201dBut that didn\u2019t last. According to Nosnitsky: \u201cThe old model remix, the one where the beat actually changes in some way, has pretty much been dead on an official level for a long time. Nowadays \u2018remix\u2019 just means that a gang of famous artists pile verses up on an existing hit.\u201d This is the format we know and love today.EVERYTHING\u2019S REAL IN THE FIELDBut how did remixes end up conquering rock, too? The answer can be summed up in two made-up words: \u201celectronica\u201d and \u201cmaxi-single.\u201dThe shift from cassettes to CDs put the single in an awkward situation. It was considerably cheaper to produce a vinyl disc or cassette with less information on it, and so a single with an a-side song and a b-side song worked logically with the format. CDs, though, cost the same amount to produce whether they contained 80 minutes or 80 seconds of music. (The mini CD, which functioned in the same way a 7\" record would, never caught on.) At this point, it became almost irresistible to start putting more and more tracks on CD singles. If the label could provide more songs with relatively little additional production cost, then they could justify charging more for the CDs. And thus was the \u201cmaxi-single\u201d born.What to put on those maxi-singles, though \u2014 especially when the whole idea was not to increase the production cost? Bands always produce more songs than fit on an album, but if a label was interested in producing, say, eight different singles for one song, you\u2019d need more than the two or three cast-offs a typical recording session would produce. The answer was remixes. Compared to a whole new recording session, they were cheap to commission, especially if you went with lesser-known producers; the remixers would be flattered to be associated with generally better-known acts; and the artist would benefit from the increased visibility with the remixer\u2019s fanbase. Throw a few of those together \u2014 especially if the remixer was kind enough to produce multiple mixes \u2014 and you had enough tracks to plausibly fill out enough maxi-singles to bilk a dedicated fan out of at least a hundred dollars. The result was that remixes, instead of being initiated by a producer drawn to a particular track, were getting done whether or not they were a good idea, just to say that such a remix existed. An apocryphal story has it that a courier arrived to pick up a commissioned remix from Richard D. James of Aphex Twin fame, and James, having forgotten to do it, simply grabbed a random track off of his shelf. He got $5,000, and the Lemonheads, the victimized band, never released the mix.But why dance remixes? The traditional filler material for rock bands, after all, was the live album, and indeed live versions of existing songs sometimes ended up on maxi-singles too. At the time, though, there was something much cooler about electronic music. In a historical context, this was unusual; rock bands had for many years defined themselves in opposition to the aesthetics and techniques of dance music. While there were certainly notable exceptions, the idea of rock bands en masse deciding that a dance remix was just the sort of thing they were looking for seemed unlikely. Rock and dance had lined up in the UK in the early \u201990s, generating some important work. This had carried forward into Britpop\u2019s more rock-oriented moment (though some were later to the party than others). When the semi-terrifying \u201celectronica\u201d trend hit the US, it coincided with the heyday of the maxi-single, and the two proved well suited to one another.AUDIO PIRACY AS COMPOSITIONAL PREROGATIVEAs with remixes, mashups can be traced back a long ways. John Oswald has been producing what he calls \u201cplunderphonics\u201d for fifty years, the KLF had a number-one hit with their mashup of Gary Glitter\u2019s \u201cRock and Roll (Part Two)\u201d and the Doctor Who theme song, and the Evolution Control Committee had a few hits on college radio in the early \u201990s with their combination of the Tijuana Brass and Public Enemy. Even Malcolm McLaren had a go at it with his haunting (really!) mashup of Joy Division and the Captain and Tennille, \u201cLove Will.\u201d As Oswald put it (in 1988), the practice of taking \u201ca recognizable sonic quote\u201d from an existing song and placing it over something else in such a way that \u201cyou can reasonably recognize the source\u201d has cropped up here and there for a long while.As the practice we know today, though, mashups weren\u2019t possible without the technological convergence of high-speed Internet, wide availability of digital music (the so-called \u201ccelestial jukebox\u201d), and low-cost audio production software. They\u2019re generally understood to have broken wide in 2001 with \u201cA Stroke of Genie-us,\u201d a track by Freelance Hellraiser combining Christina Aguilera\u2019s \u201cGenie in a Bottle\u201d and the Strokes\u2019 \u201cHard to Explain.\u201d (The track was the #26 single on the year-end Pazz and Jop critics\u2019 poll.)While prominent mashup artists have emerged (Soulwax, Osymyso, Go Home Productions, DJ Earworm and, most famously, Girl Talk), as a genre it\u2019s highly participatory, encouraging listeners to make their own mashups as much as to consume those already existing. The whole spectrum of tools now standard on any home computer enables this: a CD-ROM drive for ripping music, music recording software for editing music, and a high-speed Internet connection for finding a cappella or instrumental versions of tracks, as well as for distributing your completed work. Most important was the development of the software that let you match the beat of samples, so that even if two songs were in different tempos, you could automatically align them at the same rate without changing the pitch \u2014 a process that can take hours to do by hand.It was this same bundle of tools that lands us squarely where we are today. As the entire music market moved inexorably downward, remixes stopped being just about major acts commissioning major remixers; now any band can get its songs remixed, and anyone can be a remixer (I\u2019ve done \u2018em). While the physical reality of doing a remix used to involve the cumbersome process of getting the tracks to the remixer and the remixer having the studio space to do the edits, now people who\u2019ve never met can send each other zip files via Dropbox and everything can be accomplished on laptops.The weird thing is that there hasn\u2019t exactly been a renaissance of remixes: while opening up the floodgates to cultural production has produced a few golden ages, this area has ended up looking more like a vast, cluttered wasteland. While there have been lots of great remixes of late, they\u2019ve all been from people with major careers already: the DFA, Jaques Lu Cont, Jamie xx. Remixes have now gotten much easier to do, but they haven\u2019t necessarily gotten better; listening to Moulton\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ll Be Holding On,\u201d it\u2019s hard to say anyone\u2019s done much better.Remixing as a theoretical idea has had a lot of interesting consequences. But remixing as a musical technique has, weirdly, gone almost nowhere at all: it started great and stayed great but never altered itself much along the way. Perhaps because it\u2019s only been around a handful of decades, and that isn\u2019t enough time to ask for such dramatic twists and turns. But the story of remixing seems more or less to be the same story over and over again, retold every time the technology shifts.Sponsored posts are purely editorial content that we are pleased to have presented by a participating sponsor, advertisers do not produce the content.

As with any quality route restructuring process, he\u2019s assessing where service currently meets demand and where it\u2019s falling short of the agency\u2019s expectations for productivity, as well as riders\u2019 expectations for travel times, frequencies, and coverage.

Doing more with less is key in service development and scheduling,\u201d says senior planning officer Dietter Aragon. \u201cRemix has recently been my go-to tool for quickly calculating cost, vehicle requirements and demographic details \u2014 easily allowing me to compare existing service with proposed new service or rerouting of existing service.\u201dThe June changes will affect eight current lines of its local service; AVTA is combining some and restructuring their names, as well as shifting around weekend service and adding new services to better serve the community. Currently, Saturdays and Sundays follow the same schedule, but Sunday ridership is far lower. The June changes will boost Saturday service and possibly institute holiday service.Dietter has been pleased with Remix\u2019s ability to quickly calculate cost, miles, hours and additional demographic views, along with the number of buses AVTA will need to execute its service changes. He frequently uses the links and export tools Remix provides to present data to AVTA\u2019s executive team for review.He\u2019s hoping that the same sort of clear communication will ease the process of explaining to riders why AVTA will be changing service that\u2019s familiar to them, or making changes that don\u2019t seem immediately beneficial. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be taking Remix to the public, so when we do our outreach, we\u2019ll be able to show this live to the public and talk about each route one by one.

PowerPoint is great, but, we sometimes get comments like, \u2018How about having loop around there? Or what if you extend the service by 30 minutes?\u2019 Well, now we can show our customers in real time and they can see how that impacts cost.\u201dAdditionally, Remix has amped up Dietter\u2019s day-to-day workflow. Dietter tells us about the day that his executive director asked him to figure out how much a certain route scenario would cost. \u201cI think I was on a conference call during that time too, but it literally took me less than fifteen minutes to give him a fairly concise report. I received an email back that read \u2018Wow, that was fast\u2019.

In addition, features like Jane enable you to visualize the reach of your transit network like never before. However, we understand there are often unique or custom analyses that you may require for your workflow.Remix exports into four different formats. I\u2019ll briefly describe what each of those exports contains:So let\u2019s start with an example map in Medford, OR.You\u2019ll notice this map only has five active lines (two lines are turned off). Each export will only use the five active lines and will ignore those turned off. I\u2019m going to use this map to export in each of the four formats.Excel (.xlsx)When exporting from Remix into Microsoft Excel, nearly all of the Setting inputs and route schedule information is converted into spreadsheet format. No spatial data (lines, stops) are exported. The spreadsheet will include a summary tab, and an individual tab corresponding to each line on the exported map (in this example, five).Summary Tab You\u2019ll notice the default settings used in this map (costs, layover rules, calendar days) and a line-by-line summary showing mileage, peak buses, hours and dollars per year (based on the calendar settings).Individual Line Tab These tabs show similar information as the summary tab but go a step further to display the characteristics for each service window. In this example, the 2 West Medford only has a single service window (6:00A-7:00P).Google Earth (.kml)KML is a file format most typically used with Google Earth. When opening a KML file in Google Earth, Remix produces line information but not the associated schedules or settings. In the below example, you can see the different lines that have been imported. I\u2019ve recolored the 2-West Medford to demonstrate where they are relative to the rest of the network.Shapefile (.shp)Shapefiles are typically opened by ArcMap or other GIS software packages like QGIS. When exporting to shapefile, Remix exports both the spatial information (lines) and schedule information.In this example, I\u2019ve opened my shapefile in a free GIS program called QGIS. Here, you can see the transit lines displayed on the map.The associated attribute table shows each individual line\u2019s name and other characteristics such as mileage, frequency, and peak vehicles (information consistent with what is produced in the Excel file). You can use these characteristics to select different symbologies to recolor lines as needed.GTFS (.txt)Remix exports valid frequency-based GTFS. Frequency-based GTFS does not include the level of specificity as trip-based GTFS, which includes detail of every transit trip in the schedule. Frequency-based GTFS includes detail about service windows and associated trip frequency within those windows. For example, frequency-based GTFS describes 15 minute service between 7AM-8AM just as that, and would not specifically define trip start times. As a result, one should take caution before directly comparing Remix GTFS (frequency-based) with GTFS produced by scheduling software (trip-based) as it is not an apples-to-apples comparison.Here\u2019s an example of the file package included as part of the GTFS export.Currently, Remix does not export bus stops as part of its other exports. However, we do produce a stops.txt file which provides stop latitude and longitudes which can be geocoded in other software. The stops.txt also includes a stop_id which can be reassociated to trips (and their associated line name) through a manual linking process.Have additional questions or feedback on these exports?

We\u2019re reposting it here.Open data is here, and is being used to help build businesses and help cities make better decisions. For years, technologists have been clamoring for governments to open up more of their data. It\u2019s now happening. Cities of all sizes, from San Francisco to Asheville have open data portals filled with machine-readable data. Los Angeles, San Diego, and Philadelphia, among others, have even created executive Chief Data Officer positions that are responsible for opening data across departments. But, now that the data is out there, how is it actually getting used?I can tell you what we\u2019re up to at Remix. We\u2019re a quickly growing company that uses open data to help cities plan out better public transit. Here\u2019s a couple of examples of how we take open data, and make it available for cities to make better decisions. I\u2019ve also linked to sources and places you can find all the data we use, so be sure to follow the links! (Plug: If you\u2019re interested in building great interfaces using open data, we\u2019re hiring front-end engineers!)OpenStreetMap and Its EcosystemEverything in Remix is built on OpenStreetMap and different services and software packages in its ecosystem. In the photo above, all of the data you see in the map is coming from OpenStreetMap. We use Mapbox as a service to both generate the tiles that make up the map imagery, and to keep them up to date. OpenStreetMap has matured incredibly over the last couple of years, and offers us a number of advantages. First, the data is both accurate and easy to change. This is incredibly valuable to us, since it means that our customers immediately have correct data. And if it\u2019s not quite right, it\u2019s very easy to contribute those fixes back and quickly have them reflected in our product.One of the coolest advantages of OpenStreetMap, though, is in our routing. We\u2019re able to use Valhalla, a project from Mapzen, to do dynamic routing. This lets us snap to roads as you draw routes. Being able to do that based on the easily updatable data I mentioned above is cool in itself, but there\u2019s another advantage. OpenStreetMap actually has a tag for bus-only roads (psv, for \u201cpublic service vehicle\u201d), which means that we can use existing metadata to route bus lines over bus-only roads. This would be impossible with any other standard routing engine.Using GTFS To Show Planners Their Network Our users are transit planners \u2014 the city employees that decide where each bus goes, and how often it shows up. Without open data, often the best representation of their current transit system is the printed paper schedule. However, in recent years, agencies have begun publishing all of their schedule data in a format called the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS). You can usually find this data on the transit agency\u2019s website, or on aggregators like TransitFeeds.This data is output directly by the cities\u2019 bus scheduling systems, and is far too granular to be directly useful by the planners. It also comes in a zip of CSVs, which isn\u2019t easily digestable either. But it\u2019s in a machine-readable format, and that has let us do a bit of magic to work backwards from the super-granular schedule back to their intent. We can take open data to give cities better ideas of the systems they\u2019re running.Using the Census to Drive Better DecisionsI\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention the U.S. Census, or \u201cthe original open data,\u201d as my colleague Danny refers to it. The Census has been around since 1790, but can often be unwieldy to work with. We\u2019ve been able to take this data, all of which is freely available, and place it right in front of transit planners when they\u2019re making decisions.We were able to use some great existing open source tools, such as PostGIS, GDAL, Mapnik, and Tilestache to generate maps for a variety of factors, like population, jobs, people with low incomes, seniors, and more.We\u2019re also able to take the high granularity of the Census data, and give an instant calculation of how many people are near a route, and their demographic characteristics. To get this kind of insight before, agencies would have had to go through an arduous analysis process. However, because the data is openly available, we\u2019re able to build it right into the product and make it available at their fingertips.The Impact The important piece of this isn\u2019t that open data is pretty, but that it gives city transit planners the information they need to help justify and make better decisions. Our team hears from planners from cities of all sizes, from Marvin in Sandusky to Max near Seattle, about how Remix has changed the way they make changes, and allowed them to more efficiently evaluate and justify alternatives.

RTPO \u2014 which sets schedules and routes for Grand Valley Transit and takes feedback from its riders and drivers \u2014 is continually seeking to improve and expand service without increasing costs. This past spring, RTPO planners began route modifications that reduced duplication and switched inbound and outbound paths.We interviewed Biz about the particular challenges of planning for Mesa County (which has an exceptionally long route map), and she told us what it\u2019s like to use web-based maps in a public outreach process.Can you tell me about the demographics of Mesa County and the riders you work with? There\u2019s a population of 150,000 total. The bus system serves the metropolitan area, which is Grand Junction, Palisade, and the unincorporated areas in between. The primary trip purpose is between work and home, which we know from onboard surveys. We\u2019ve captured the transit-dependent population, who is who we really serve right now \u2014 those without a vehicle, minorities, the LEP population. We\u2019re working on branching into choice riders and high-density areas, like anywhere with apartment buildings. Mesa County is conservative politically. It\u2019s dry, it\u2019s hot, it\u2019s beautiful.I came into this office about eight months before we got Remix. We had done a route modification before then; this one is my first. From what I understand, the process was getting in the vehicle and driving the route. The planners would look at GIS maps, then Google-mapped drive time to estimate it. It wasn\u2019t perfect because it was inaccurate. Physically getting in a car doesn\u2019t give you the real transit experience because it\u2019s hard to keep the same speed. Finally, they\u2019d ride a bus. It was a lot longer of a process and was more complicated with more inaccuracies.Can you tell me about using Remix for public involvement? We used it to provide a visual display of the routes. I\u2019m a visual person, and the majority of people are, too. Having a map for people to see without it being such a big file that you can\u2019t download, or it being a GIS file that you can\u2019t use \u2014 Remix was a way that we could share ideas and proposed routes, and they could zoom in and out to see how it would affect their path and route to wherever they go. We got a lot of comments directly from the map \u2014 the \u201csend a comment\u201d elicited a lot of responses.Our website had a page dedicated to proposed route changes. We had a link right there to check out proposed routes visually and had a verbal description below that included stops. We directed people to the website and they could follow along.It was nice to be able to share this with our dispatch and road supervisors, various staff who aren\u2019t so fluent or familiar with GIS. Frequently, one on-the-ground perspective was very different from the planner perspective. Letting them use the same tools that we\u2019re using is very empowering, and we can get more helpful feedback. (RTPO asked for another login for certain emails so dispatchers and operators were able to access it on their computers. They could share maps and during the route modification process, the planners received some maps from them.) We\u2019ll continue to do this in the future.I think we can test innovative ideas more easily and get more creative with routes and service and options by seeing them in a dry run. That\u2019s really helpful, and it\u2019s a lot easier thinking down the road about major changes.Based on times, this has reduced labor on the transportation-planner end. I\u2019m benefitting a lot, but it benefits the public for that visual component. Our system map is huge, and if they can\u2019t download a document because of slow Internet, they can\u2019t view a PDF. This is so much more user-friendly for the average Joe, and it allows them to interact with the proposed maps.What have you been doing with your newfound free time?

Though the region has major employment centers, they frequently spring up outside of TARC\u2019s service areas, and a considerable amount of effort from the agency goes into determining if it\u2019s feasible to bring transit to those centers.Here\u2019s how Josh Poe, a transit planner at TARC, describes the many steps involved in making those decisions:\u201cTransit operating cost generally consists of three variables; time-based cost, distance-based cost, and vehicle-based cost. Prior to Remix, transit planners estimated these costs using separate software systems. First, a GIS system was used to calculate distances, then Excel or a third party scheduling software was employed to calculate hours per day, from which you could calculate how many vehicles needed. This was a long process, particularly if you wanted to compare the cost of extending existing routes or adding a new route. However, transit service decisions are not based purely on financial motives: There are federal regulations involving civil rights, along with conflicting ridership goals versus coverage goals, so a demographic data analysis was also necessary, which involves analyzing Census data in GIS. This was a convoluted process, but Remix has combined these steps into one simple format.\u201dJosh says that fulfilling these requests well enough to make comparisons once took a few days to a week. With Remix, he\u2019s able to do that level of data analysis \u2014 to answer questions like, \u201cWhat is the cost of extending a route to serve an employer? or \u201cWhich route do we extend if we want to extend it?\u201d \u2014 in drastically less time.\u201cI can take now take separate routes, add extensions to those, or create a new route and get costing estimates and demographic numbers in a couple hours. Once I have it in that format, that\u2019s very easy to share with management so that they can make decisions,\u201d Josh says. \u201cAs in any organization, management doesn\u2019t need to wade through complex details. They want information quickly, and they want it to be simple and concise so they can make better, more informed decisions.\u201dTARC\u2019s planners initially attracted to Remix for its costing capability, given the numerous requests they receive to answer those kinds of \u201cwhat-if\u201d questions. But Josh has used Remix in a multitude of ways:For project-level cost estimates: Josh has used Remix to determine the preliminary costs of a TIGER-funded BRT project and to analyze three transit projects within Move Louisville (pictured above), the city\u2019s comprehensive transportation plan.As a database: Josh has built \u201ctemplates\u201d in Remix, so that he can copy a map and adjust headways or running time. As his database has become more robust, he\u2019s been able to field \u201cwhat-if\u201d questions even more rapidly.As a research tool: To see demographics within a quarter mile of a specific stop, Josh will draw \u201ca line on that stop, as if it were a transit route,\u201d and pull up the demographic information.Additionally, Josh used Remix to evaluate reducing redundancy on a particular corridor with three routes. He was able to increase the span of service, the frequency, and the coverage; provide better service on weekends; and make it almost cost-neutral.\u201cI could have done it without Remix, but it would have been such a time-consuming process,\u201d he says. \u201cThe time of planning, and the management of information, has changed so much with Remix.

A Case Study on DetoursRemixFollowAug 5, 2015 \u00b7 2 min readVIA Metropolitan Transit is based in San Antonio, TX and has been using Remix to sketch and plan their system detours.Over the past few weeks, we\u2019ve been watching VIA\u2019s transit planning team (with increased fascination) as they vigorously mapped out routes called \u201cFiesta.\u201d We called up Art Herrera, a senior planner at VIA, to see what the party was all about.Turns out, Fiesta is an annual tradition in San Antonio, where the streets downtown explode into a nonstop two-week bash with parades, block parties, and concerts.While thrilling for the city, it\u2019s tough on the local transit agency \u2014 who must grapple with detours and street closures at the exact same place where most of the service converges for their hub-and-spoke system. During certain days of Fiesta, over half of VIA\u2019s routes must be modified to ensure ongoing connections for its 150K daily riders, an immense undertaking.For decades, it\u2019s been a challenge for VIA to design detours and schedules during Fiesta due to many alignment changes and unpredictable activity of the event. To provide some clarity, they\u2019ve tried manually managing vehicles locations and spacing with road supervisors and dispatchers tracking vehicle locations. Yet, operators could never tell if they were on time and most importantly, it was nearly impossible for the general public to know when the bus was actually coming.This year, instead of using traditional tools to plan for 2016\u2019s raucous event, they are using Remix to envision alternatives. \u201cBy drawing out the modified/cut/detoured routes, we can see what headways we can provide given the existing number of vehicles\u2026 and do this relatively quickly and easily,\u201d said Art.Here\u2019s a snapshot of one line they\u2019re planning.With their new-found experience drawing for Fiesta, VIA is also trying out a few other things in Remix. \u201cIt has been extremely useful in the development of service plans for 5-year capital plans.\u201dPretty cool stuff.

These patterns can include trips that travel some portions of the route\u2019s full length.Remix\u2019s beta version of pattern imports means that our platform now more accurately replicates the patterns that exist in transit networks.Until recently, Remix would evaluate a transit agency\u2019s GTFS data and import the longest \u201cshape\u201d of a route, regardless of any patterns. Now, you can import individual patterns for each route in your system.When you click \u201cImport\u201d on the left sidebar, you\u2019ll see a dropdown arrow next to the agency name that will reveal a toggle that allows you to \u201cImport route patterns.\u201d When toggled on, you\u2019ll see the patterns for routes within your system shown as different letters.Once imported, these patterns appear in Remix as separate routes so you can evaluate them individually. For example, here AC Transit Line 11 is imported as three patterns: 11A, 11B, 11C.Route patterns are made possible by parsing your agency\u2019s GTFS and looking for slight differences in scheduled time points and stop locations.

Pierce Transit serves the southern Puget Sound region and, while its Destination 2040 plan wasn\u2019t designed completely in Remix, Max used our platform to illustrate an included aspirational scenario \u2014 a total reinvention of the network. Rather than redrawing the Pierce Transit\u2019s entire network in GIS, Max drew it in Remix, along with a.m. peak frequencies, and exported it as a shapefile.But long-range plans don\u2019t happen every day. Pierce\u2019s planners are constantly evaluating routes on a short- and medium-range basis, and in doing so, typically draw out every iteration of a change that they can imagine. Exploring so many different options allows Max and his team to come up with compromises that \u201cmake the most number of riders happy, or perform the best,\u201d he says. \u201cWith Remix, it makes it easier to explore that intellectually, rather than taking those ideas and manually digitizing everything, then calculating the service requirements.\u201d Regionally, service changes now take place in March and September, so tweaks that Max is considering could take place then.Pierce Transit is also using Remix to consider different scenarios for a proposed BRT line over its most productive route, which could be anywhere from seven to 20 miles. \u201cThere are a lot of ways to skin a cat,\u201d Max says, and he\u2019s used Remix throughout the development of three main scenarios: \u201cWe would draw it out, where we thought the proposed termini were, along with the proposed route, and that quickly gives us an estimate of not only the service hours and miles for each of those scenarios, roughly how many people and jobs and other demographic factors are nearby.\u201dAs those scenarios are further developed, they\u2019ll be taken to Pierce Transit\u2019s board, to focus groups, and, eventually, to the public \u2014 all of which will come with input and negotiations. \u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to sell something to someone in a meeting, when you\u2019re trying to get your executives engaged and there are these heated discussions about \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just turn around at this transit center? Why do we have to go all the way to downtown Tacoma?\u201d and it\u2019s handy to be able to say, \u201cWell, when we draw this line over here, Remix tells us that we can serve an additional 14,000 jobs within a quarter-mile of those downtown stops\u201d he says. \u201cSo it makes it a more compelling argument for why you\u2019re doing things a certain way when you can quickly see what the efficacy of where you\u2019re placing the stops and how you\u2019re structuring the route.\u201dCustomer comments aren\u2019t beholden to the occasions of particular planning initiatives, and Max has also used Remix to answer inquiries about general service patterns. When a customer submitted a comment, he sketched out the hypothetical out in Remix, \u201cjust to see what it looked like and to see if it made sense,\u201d he says. \u201cFor those quick little investigations \u2014 reality-checking something \u2014 it\u2019s kind of handy.\u201dFor more about Pierce Transit, read our interview with Max Henkle.Photo via Flickr", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Public Transit", "Case Study", "Pierce Transit", "Max Henkle", "Customer Story"]}, {"title": "Remix Pro Tips and Tricks: The Top Five", "post_link": "https://blog.remix.com/remix-pro-tips-and-tricks-the-top-five-f853a1aebfa3?source=search_post", "author_name": "Remix", "author_link": "https://blog.remix.com/@remix123", "publish_date": "2016-05-20", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-24", "readtime": "2.24", "claps": 1, "voters": 1, "content": "Remix Pro Tips and Tricks: The Top FiveRemixFollowMay 20, 2016 \u00b7 3 min readWe\u2019ve heard that Remix is great because it\u2019s easy to use and fast. Here are a few tips we\u2019ve heard from around the Remix Community to help you plan transit even faster!1) Use Multiple Remix Map WindowsIf you\u2019d like to compare the vital stats for two line alternatives, open up multiple browser windows to see them side-by-side. Since Remix is web-based, you can open up multiple Remix maps at any given time to see the whole story.Also, remember you can print a line summary for any line on your map.2) Use keyboard shortcutsIf you have a line selected, can use the J and K keys to quickly scroll through other lines on your map. This is really useful if you are comparing two lines and want to toggle back and forth to quickly compare their results.You can also use the I and O keys to toggle back and forth between the inbound (I) and outbound (O) direction of a line.Finally the + and \u2014 buttons can be used to zoom in and out of your map. These zoom buttons (like the ones on the screen) are sometimes more precise as compared to using the scroll wheel on your mouse.3) Ctrl+F to search your mapSince Remix works in any standard internet browser, standard shortcuts apply such as Ctrl+P to print and Ctrl+F to find. The latter is particuarly useful if you\u2019re trying to import a line within a long list of services. By using the standard browser search feature, you can quickly identify the line you\u2019re seeking without scrolling through a longer list.4) Be CreativeWe\u2019ve heard lots of creative strategies about how people use Remix. Here are a few examples:Splitting lines into two directions to represent peak-direction serviceUsing bus stops as a way to capture demographics for future bikeshare stationsPlanning deviated-fixed route service by drawing a normal line, but simply slowing down the travel speed (accounting for deviations)Capturing a location\u2019s demographics by simply dropping a bus stop on that location (and not drawing the remainder of the line)Posting a Remix map on the agency\u2019s website with ongoing route detours for public informationAs you become more familiar with Remix, don\u2019t be afraid to use it in ways that fit your needs that might not fit the norm!5) Ask the Success TeamThere are several workflows that we can help with on the back-end such as merging maps together, adding custom data layers, and more.

Its fixed-route and demand-response services, which see, respectively, about 140,000 and 60,000 trips per year, are all under the purview of Marvin Ranaldson, Sandusky\u2019s transit administrator. Marvin worked as a bike messenger; with All Aboard Ohio; and as Bike Cleveland\u2019s volunteer and outreach manager before taking over transit in the rollercoaster capital of the world.But Sandusky\u2019s transit doesn\u2019t just serve Cedar Point: There\u2019s the 800-room Kalahari Resort; a historic downtown core with many no-car households; and miles of rural Erie County, which has a considerable senior population. \u201cOur ridership has grown 15 percent per year for the past five years, but I know we can do better,\u201d Marvin tells us.Marvin is using Remix to orchestrate a system redesign that will combat overcrowding and scheduling issues, so we checked in with him to learn what the challenges his system faces. With three current routes, the city of Sandusky is Remix\u2019s smallest, but perhaps mightiest, customer.What kind of work have you been doing with Remix specifically? We need to do a system redesign because our travel times point to point are really atrocious. First of all, we have three individual routes and they all go in a counterclockwise fashion, so they\u2019re all one-way. One-way transit routes are really good in one direction, but really bad in the other. It\u2019s really difficult to get them to work well, especially, so, I have a route that goes 23 miles. It\u2019s a lot. It\u2019s difficult to make the transit service more attractive unless we can do something about the travel times. They can\u2019t stay on schedule, either, because they\u2019re just stretched. The schedules are a little bit too optimistic and we get behind.Can you tell me more about process for this redesign? I started it. I got some feedback from some people in City Hall. We\u2019re going to begin our formal public meetings and feedback sessions early next year. The gist of it is, we\u2019re going to go from three to five routes. All of them will be two-way and bidirectional. I\u2019m splitting up some of our peak loads so our trips that are going out to Kalahari, which is a huge driver of traffic for us. I\u2019m going to have two buses, two individual routes serve it going in opposite directions to split that load up. Even with our large transit buses, we\u2019ve been overcrowding those buses servicing [Kalahari], because they\u2019re all getting off at the same time. We just don\u2019t have enough vehicles there to take care of that.Will you need to purchase new vehicles? My hope is, to be honest, our 40-foot buses aren\u2019t new, they\u2019re used, they\u2019re over 16 years old, so we got them used. I\u2019m hoping I can either replace them with smaller, more cost-effective buses \u2014 basically, replace one bus with two buses going in different directions to handle that traffic flow, or just have one big bus on the route like we have now, but not have the overcrowding issues we have now.You\u2019re mostly serving service workers, right?Right. We have the core of Sandusky, where everything\u2019s built up. It\u2019s very urban. It doesn\u2019t seem like it would be, but it\u2019s very urban. It\u2019s a very old city. We have all the people who live in the city, they don\u2019t have cars. We send them out to the nearby suburb \u2014 there\u2019s only one suburb. We send them out there to get to work, and that\u2019s where all the shopping is, as well. But the rest of the county is farmland, small towns, little villages that don\u2019t have access, and there are some elderly there that don\u2019t have access to vehicles, and they need to get to the grocery store. We have a lot of people taking the bus into town to get to the hospital. We have the largest medical center in northern Ohio.How does your demand-response system work?We don\u2019t have paratransit like a big city does. We have demand-response, which covers the entire county, which is 100 square miles or so. Most of our ridership comes from 20 square miles around Sandusky. We had to find ways to do it more efficiently and be more cost-effective.That\u2019s where we find the greatest opportunity to grow, because demand-response has been stagnant over the past six years. All the growth has come through our fixed routes, but demand-response has gotten more and more expensive. We found some ways to reduce the cost of that and that allows us to focus more on fixed routes.Why is demand-response not cost-effective \u2014 because the area\u2019s so big and not very dense? Yeah, it\u2019s sending one bus to pick up two people, or sending one bus to go to the door to pick up a person, when you could send them to one bus stop and make it more of a scheduled route. That\u2019s more cost-effective to do. Walmart, for example \u2014 I get so many demand-response trips going to Walmart, or going to Kroger, that somehow consolidating those trips onto one bus or one vehicle makes it a lot more cost-effective. Those are the people who need our service the most.So how did you get into transportation planning?I started out as a bike messenger when I graduated high school, and I went into mechanical engineering with a focus on automotive engineering. My first interaction with transit was on a bike and through cars, making cars, thinking about cars. I decided it sucked.

Available to everyone, today.RemixFollowMay 12, 2016 \u00b7 3 min readWe\u2019ve redesigned the drawing experience in Remix to allow you draw concepts quickly, accurately, taking advantage of our knowledge of existing bus stop infrastructure. We\u2019ve called these new features QuickDraw and Stops 2.0 and they transform drawing in Remix.Here\u2019s a 5-minute demonstration:\u201cSo intuitive you don\u2019t need much training, I understood the new features very quickly\u201d\u2013 Chris Loader, Public Transport VictoriaFrequently Asked QuestionsWe have meticulously designed these new features to be simple and clear. However, we understand there are questions with a change this big. Here are five common questions:What are the differences between stops and pins?Stops represent actual bus stops. Remix will calculate nearby demographic information based on stops. Pins tell Remix where to place the bus line. Think of it like \u201cpinning\u201d a string to a map to represent your bus line. If you want to modify an existing or draw a new line, you\u2019ll use pins.Can I add bus stops (in addition to those already in my system)?Yes! Remix will automatically import existing bus stops based on your transit agency. However, if you want to add a bus stop, simply right click on the line and you\u2019ll be prompted to \u201cCreate new stop\u201d. You\u2019ll have the option to add a bus stop name. This stop will be visible on this map (and other maps copied from this map). However, if you create a brand new map, this stop will not appear.What happens to my current maps?Your current maps are absolutely safe and we haven\u2019t changed anything (including lines and bus stops). However, you have the option to \u201cupgrade\u201d your maps to take advantage of the new bus stops information (including bus stop names and stop IDs). Simply click on \u201cFind stops\u201d in the line options menu above the line name).By clicking on \u201cFind stops\u201d Remix will rematch all of the map\u2019s stops (actual and proposed) to the existing bus stops based on your agency\u2019s GTFS loaded into Remix. If you have any concerns, you can always make a copy of your map before running our stopfinder.Important Note: Because many agencies place stops differently, our stopfinder process may require some modification. If you see something odd, let us know and we\u2019ll investigate!With Stops 2.0, we take advantage of existing GTFS data including the bus stop name and stop id. You can access this information by right clicking on the bus stop itself.What stops are saved in the GTFS export?One of the most exciting things about Stops 2.0 is information on existing vs. new bus stops when modifying your system. The stops.txt file in the GTFS export already produces a list of bus stops. You now can differentiate between existing stops and created stops through the stop_id field. Existing bus stops will maintain your agency\u2019s original stop identification code, while Remix created stops will be appended with remix-.We look forward to hearing your thoughts on these exciting new features!

LTD currently functions as a hub-and-spoke system, though as the region grows, explains Tim Simon, a service planner, LTD\u2019s configuration is slowly changing.\u201cOur downtown Eugene station is where most of our transfer activity occurs,\u201d he says. \u201cTransfers are essential, but we also are confined by the limited capacity of our station. As Eugene grows, so does the its need for improved transit \u2014 I kind of call Eugene a mid-major city that\u2019s about to make the leap into a bigger city with more transit requirements. Station capacity is essential, so we\u2019re really looking at making a jump from a hub-and-spoke to more of a hybrid.\u201dAs LTD plans for more crosstown connections \u2014 both organically and through a long-range planning process called Moving Ahead that includes building out the successful EmX BRT \u2014 Tim has employed Remix.Without Remix, a sketching session like that could have taken weeks.\u201cHow Remix really saves me time is instead of drawing something on, you know, taking a screenshot of Google and doing a hand-drawn line image, or doing something like that and submitting it to our graphics team and waiting on them to make a map, then realizing there\u2019s a mistake and sending it back, I can do all this now and come up with unlimited scenarios within an hour,\u201d he says. Without Remix, a sketching session like that could have taken weeks. Tim has also reduced the amount of time spent in either LTD\u2019s scheduling software, or physically driving, to estimate a route\u2019s potential costs.Plus, Tim has tackled a particularly confounding spot within LTD\u2019s service area, a golf course among senior and low-income housing nicknamed the \u201cdonut hole.\u201d Bounded by highways and a river, it lacks any effective through-routes, and over the past 30 years, LTD planners have struggled to connect it effectively to the rest of the system. Facing public pressure to route service through the donut hole once again, Tim used Remix to illustrate all seven lines that have served the area since 1985. He named each map the title of the historical route (see below) and the years it was active, and brought it to LTD\u2019s board.We need to do something that hasn\u2019t been done before, which is establish the frequency and serve the area with a crosstown route.\u201cI put them all in there together so you can see how many iterations there are, just so [the board] understands that throwing out another one, a different configuration, that\u2019s been done in the past and it\u2019s not the way to go,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to do something that hasn\u2019t been done before, which is establish the frequency and serve the area with a crosstown route.

How to Adjust your Line\u2019s ScheduleRemixFollowNov 20, 2015 \u00b7 3 min readAt Remix, we know that transit schedules are complicated, so we\u2019ve made a line\u2019s schedule viewable in a straightforward format. Once you\u2019ve learned what one row means, you\u2019ve learned them all!Take a look at this schedule for the 21-Hayes in San Francisco:Our schedule breaks down a service into separate service days: weekday, Saturday, and Sunday. Below is how weekday service looks in Remix. We\u2019ll use this example to walk through what each column means:From, To: These describe the service windows, or the times between which the service is operating. The above example of weekday service shows that the 21-Hayes operates between 5 a.m. and 6:30 a.m.Every: This represents frequency. Here, 21-Hayes is operating every 18 minutes between 5 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. on weekdays.Runtime: This is the estimated transit runtime based on the combined inbound and outbound route length and speed. If the speed increases and the route\u2019s length stays the same, the runtime will go down. If the speed stays the same and the length increases, the runtime will go up.Layover: This represents the time needed at the end of the line for schedule recovery and driver breaks. Layover is a fixed number based on the settings in your Remix map. You can adjust the layover settings to be a percentage of the runtime or a fixed number of minutes. Here, the 21-Hayes\u2019 layover is set at 10 percent of the runtime.Speed: The estimated running speed of the route includes dwell time at stops, but does not include the time when the bus is stopped during layover. Traffic congestion, presence of transit-only lanes or facilities, the number of bus stops, and locations with high dwell time (meaning, lots of passengers) can impact a bus\u2019 speed. Remix does not automatically determine these factors. When we import your agency\u2019s GTFS data, we estimate a line\u2019s speed based on its length and schedule information.Buses: Based on a line\u2019s length, speed, and frequency, Remix estimates the number of buses required. For example, if your runtime is 60 minutes and your frequency is 60 minutes, we estimate one bus. If your run time is 60 minutes, but your frequency is 30 minutes, we estimate two buses.Wiggle: Wiggle is a spot-check for a route\u2019s efficiency: It shows how much time remains before an additional vehicle is needed. Extend the route\u2019s length, lengthen the layover time, or change the frequency, and wiggle will help you gauge the \u201cslack\u201d in your schedule before adding that additional bus. In this example, 7.2 minutes remain before the 21-Hayes will require an additional bus, which would bring the total buses used on that line to 5 buses.Every row in the schedule can be edited to reflect different times of day. If you have a very simple schedule, you can use the \u201c\u2026\u201d button on the right side of any schedule row to add or remove service windows. In the example below, I\u2019ve deleted every service window (including Saturday and Sunday) except between 5 a.m.-6:30 a.m. I can click \u201c\u2026\u201d and \u201cAdd service window\u201d to add them back. If you are making numerous schedule edits, keyboard shortcuts exist that can make this process even faster.Now that you know the ins and outs of the line schedule panel, give it a try in Remix.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Public Transit", "Product"]}, {"title": "Meet a Planner: Josh Baker of GLTC in Lynchburg, VA", "post_link": "https://blog.remix.com/josh-baker-of-gltc-f7143e6b847d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Remix", "author_link": "https://blog.remix.com/@remix123", "publish_date": "2015-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-12", "readtime": "3.95", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Meet a Planner: Josh Baker of GLTC in Lynchburg, VARemixFollowNov 16, 2015 \u00b7 4 min readSince his start as an operator in Blacksburg, Virginia, while attending Virginia Tech, Josh Baker has explored nearly every plane of the transportation universe. After college, he matched his business acumen with his belief in public transportation to start Radford, Virginia\u2019s transit system. Now, he\u2019s the general manager of Greater Lynchburg Transit Company, an established system in southern Virginia that can trace its roots back to the city\u2019s horsedrawn carriage network.While overseeing the construction of a new operations and management facility, Josh is also strategizing how to bring GLTC to the next level, which, he tells us, involves \u201crevising our routes, making our structure work better, implementing new technology, making the ridership experience better, improving the frequency of our service, the usability of our fare collection, and upping our focus on our customers.\u201dTransitioning from an operator to a general manager has given Josh exceptional insight on how people use transit. We spoke to him about what it was like to build a system from the ground up and the challenges facing transportation planning in low-density, sprawling cities like Lynchburg.How has having an operations background helped you as a GM?I think this helps me understand what the drivers and maintenance personnel are going through. I understand what it takes to drive a bus and what goes on and how all of this comes together, and that helped me immensely in being able to build the Radford transit system from the ground up. Now I\u2019ve come into GLTC, which is a very old system and has a lot of history, and come into a place where you\u2019ve got a variety of challenges and things going on, and I can look at it from the perspective of a front-line person. Some of the world\u2019s greatest success stories of positive, effective workplaces are companies that take their direction and guidance from their front line, because they know what\u2019s going on.Are there specific instances of your operator knowledge in action?All the time! It comes into play when you think about the factors that cause a bus to be able to run on schedule, or not run on schedule; when you\u2019re trying to sort out what are some trends in what\u2019s going on with your operations and ridership. It gives you the ability have a better idea, beyond a hunch, where to look. For Radford, where I was going around setting up the locations of bus stops and understanding, drawing out on a map exactly where the route would go, I was able to do that in an effective way looking at the area because my intuition and understanding of how people move around and how they need connectivity came into play.The pieces really fell into place and we were in the right place at the right time. You have to be, in situations like this, to be ready to jump when you sense that people are buying in. That buy-in may only last for a year and then it\u2019s gone. If you miss it, you missed it. It\u2019s not going to come back. It excited me and I saw a need and I thought I could make a difference for the community, and I think we did. My reward is getting to see that and getting to see the effects. I can remember for the first year or two driving down the street in Radford: Seeing even one single person standing at one single bus stop was the greatest thing ever. It was the best thing to look at it. When you see that stop and you can say, damn, we put that bus stop there, we hammered the sign into the street, and we put the bus on the road \u2014 you\u2019ll always remember that.What\u2019s your ultimate dream for your agency, now that you\u2019re at GLTC?I\u2019d like to see us provide more frequent service throughout the city. I\u2019d like to see us expand our choice riders. I\u2019d like to see us put ourselves at the level that is high enough to attract the attention of those who otherwise might not consider riding our service. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a simple solution or a perfect way to get and recruit riders, but we\u2019ll try. Most of the time, it\u2019s economically driven. When gas prices are low and the economy\u2019s doing well, it\u2019s a different story than when people have tight budgets and tight situations to deal with.I personally don\u2019t ride it regularly as a commuter, and I think that in itself is part of why I really want to improve what we do. Like many other choice riders, it\u2019s just not frequent enough for me. I\u2019ll often ride my buses as part of community outreach and to understand what the challenges are, but I wouldn\u2019t be so naive as to claim to be someone who uses my system when I don\u2019t. I think that I personally face the same challenges that many other choice riders face.What do you think about the future of transportation?I think that transit is something that is more heavily demanded by Millennials and Gen X, Gen Y than was by the Baby Boomers. It\u2019s demanded to be more like your New Yorks, Chicagos, and San Franciscos. In order for a city to be viable and marketable to these younger generations, transit needs to be frequent; it needs to be clean; it needs to be accessible, convenient; and it needs to be technology-driven, with payment options like using your cell phone or credit card.I think it\u2019s an industry that has a lot of catching up to do. I don\u2019t know exactly how we\u2019re going to do that, or in what way to convince all entities why transit is so important. Ultimately it\u2019s about connecting all of the generations around a central issue, to provide accessibility and mobility to everybody.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Public Transit", "Interview", "Lynchburg", "Josh Baker", "Customer Story"]}, {"title": "Jane Now Travels All Day and Weekends", "post_link": "https://blog.remix.com/jane-now-travels-all-day-and-weekends-821404fc6c75?source=search_post", "author_name": "Remix", "author_link": "https://blog.remix.com/@remix123", "publish_date": "2015-10-08", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-07", "readtime": "0.93", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Jane Now Travels All Day and WeekendsRemixFollowOct 8, 2015 \u00b7 1 min readWe heard from many of you that Jane needs to travel during different times of the day and different days of the week.

Then, the only data available to PART was raw commuter figures and a regional travel demand model that looked at the area within the four metropolitan planning organizations in the region \u2014 which didn\u2019t align entirely with PART\u2019s ten-county service area. When Kyle and his team looked at Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data, they realized they weren\u2019t connecting people from Davidson County to the most desired places. Remix enabled them to add PART\u2019s specific costing information and view adjustments to the line on top of LEHD data, which should radically improve the efficiency and service of Route 9.\u201cPlugging [revenue hour cost] in and moving the lines around was phenomenal for us and allowed us to say, yes, we can increase frequency if we can change the route,\u201d Kyle says. By being able to estimate how much money we should save, we could say, all right, now we can pop in two roundtrips in the morning, two roundtrips in the evening, and one midday and still run it with one bus and two drivers. It really did help us see that it was possible for us to make some novel changes for our system of route analysis and planning.\u201dChanges to Route 9 go into effect on January 11, so PART\u2019s planners have been reaching out to riders to explain the upcoming changes. They\u2019re hearing a groundswell of appreciation.\u201cWe got on the buses to talk to folks to tell them what we\u2019re planning and why, and the public seemed to be understanding. No one was angry. The folks who were getting on at that one little stop at the edge of High Point, they were so excited because it would make things easier for them,\u201d Kyle says. \u201cThe morning that I was riding it, it was a cold, misty morning and the folks out there, with no shelter, were really happy about the idea of catching the bus downtown at the transit center where there\u2019s shelter and a waiting room. A lot of them had to catch a HiTran bus from somewhere else, go to the downtown transit center, and take another bus to get to the stop we served.\u201dPART is using Remix to evaluate changes to another line, Route 10, with particular emphasis on Remix\u2019s LEHD-based jobs data layer.

Its goal was to \u201creduce impact to the community to the minimum possible\u201d during the agency shakeup, which brought down the number of lines from 37 to 27 overseen by ATI, says engineer Francisco Klein. Francisco and his team used Remix to assess the conditions of existing service prior to ATI\u2019s conception, consider demographic and costing information for the new routes, and compare the two. In addition, the information provided by Remix was used in PRITA\u2019s Title VI compliance report, justifying the changes from the 2013 routes to 2015 routes.We\u2019ve been using Jane as a comparative tool when seeing how the relocation or elimination of former, existing routes looked. What would the impact be on the service and the overall community?Jane, our isochrone, was particularly useful for Francisco\u2019s work. \u201cWe\u2019ve been using Jane as a comparative tool when seeing how the relocation or elimination of former, existing routes looked,\u201d he says, \u201cWhat would the impact be on the service and the overall community?\u201dViewing Census data in Remix\u2019s layers also helped his team see the social impact \u2014 particularly on senior, youth, and car-free populations \u2014 of the route changes. In Puerto Rico, taking transit is too often stigmatized as an indicator that you don\u2019t have the ability to own a car, Francisco says. As a result, EFGB has focused on creating \u201can efficient and reliable system so that people who need it most use it and can say, \u2018Yeah, this is working very well, and it\u2019s meeting the goal and expectations,\u2019 and that could eventually translate into more people seeing transit as an alternative.\u201dWhile ATI is regulating and controlling the new routes planned for the Metropolitan Area of San Juan, the consultants have used Remix to consider systems in other municipalities of the island. Those local services will ultimately work with the systems and routes ATI proposes at an island-wide level. To foster strong and effective service between ATI and the municipal routes, Francisco focused on population data. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to have a system that would be spending too much money and having very limited ridership, so we made sure that we could reach areas with population concentration\u201d in Aguadilla, on Puerto Rico\u2019s north coast, and several municipalities on the southeastern side.I think that, we\u2019ve had it since the beginning, and it\u2019s a perfect combination of integrating things into one single platform. So if you were not using Remix, then you\u2019d have to do it manually\u201cI think that, we\u2019ve had it since the beginning, and it\u2019s a perfect combination of integrating things into one single platform. So if you were not using Remix, then you\u2019d have to do it manually,\u201d says Francisco. \u201cYou\u2019d have to basically lay out the routes, and then go looking for the different layers in different systems. So having everything integrated right there, it\u2019s just cost-effective, it\u2019s efficient overall.\u201dWhile data on ATI\u2019s revamped bus system has yet to be calculated \u2014 the new lines were only implemented this past summer \u2014 Francisco says that his team \u201crecognize[d] that some of the routes were just too long, and so Remix has been very helpful in assessing that the proposed routes are not as long as they used to be. That way, we think we\u2019re taking one step in the right direction of having a more efficient and reliable system.\u201dMoving forward, EFGB will do ride-check and point-check studies to determine the impact of the new routes. Once the data analysis process has been completed, they plan to continue to use Remix to assess potential route changes based on the collected data.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Puerto Rico", "Customer Story", "Case Study", "Public Transit"]}, {"title": "Meet a Planner: Raymond Mui of DASH (Alexandria, VA)", "post_link": "https://blog.remix.com/raymond-mui-of-dash-alexandria-7f0bc314987c?source=search_post", "author_name": "Remix", "author_link": "https://blog.remix.com/@remix123", "publish_date": "2015-10-19", "last_modified_date": "2018-02-22", "readtime": "4.20", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Meet a Planner: Raymond Mui of DASH (Alexandria, VA)RemixFollowOct 19, 2015 \u00b7 5 min readRaymond Mui is the director of planning and scheduling for DASH, which serves commuters, tourists, and everyone in between in Alexandria, Virginia, an independent city adjacent to Washington, D.C. Ask him what he does, and he\u2019ll rattle off an impressive scope:\u201cEverything from long-range, 20-year long-range planning all the way down to operator scheduling, runcutting, bidding, bid administration, and every step in between. We do long-range planning, we do short-range planning, we do annual budget developments, we do both short-range and long-range service planning and changes, route expansions and improvements, project implementation. We also have a large role in technology implementation and projects, so right now we\u2019re in the middle of the implementation of our automated vehicle location system. We do our routine service and schedule changes, which includes assembling and administering the bidding process. This part of the year, we\u2019re starting on our annual budgeting process for trading out budgets for the next year, our operating budget and our capital budget, which we do every year for a 10-year window. Also, we do a lot of grant work.\u201dDeservedly so, Raymond landed on Mass Transit magazine\u2019s 40 Under 40 list this year. While it\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019s the world\u2019s youngest direct of planning and scheduling, we\u2019re awed by the breadth and depth of his work. We talked to Raymond about the nuances of interagency coordination in the D.C. area and heard from him about what it\u2019s like to revolutionize his agency\u2019s heretofore paper-based planning processes.In what ways are you trying to push more tech, more data, and more innovative processes at DASH?Historically, especially before I came here, the kind of stuff we\u2019ve been doing is very manual, very antiquated, paper-based, old-fashioned. Some of it we still do. A lot of what we do, I want to improve our efficiency in how we do it and the reliability and the comprehensiveness of all of our data. I think that the more or the better that we see and understand our system \u2014 and that has everything to do with how we collect our data and what data we have available to us \u2014 the more we are better able to improve our system and optimize efficiency, effectiveness, and the user experience. Without having adequate data to do your planning and your scheduling, it\u2019s like trying to drive a car blind. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to improve on with the whole function of the department, which is to have an abundance of data available to us to do everything that we do. It\u2019s not that data that we need or that we want, but data that we don\u2019t even realize we can use to our benefit or advantage yet. So that\u2019s one of the things we\u2019re looking forward to with the implementation of the AVL system, APC technology, and Remix.For example, Remix specifically will open up a lot of capabilities to us that we previously have not had available in our department, like the ability to overlay different data sets and be able to determine what percentage of ridership is below the poverty level, or doesn\u2019t have cars, or whatever specific alignment that we are developing a proposal for, as well as streamlining cost development, resource development, resource estimating, and cost estimating. It will help us streamline our process so we can do it in minutes instead of days.You know, what I\u2019ve done, in the past, before Remix, what I\u2019d usually do was take a screenshot of an online map, put it in Paint, and draw the lines on it. That\u2019s how I used to draw my maps. We don\u2019t have ArcGIS, none of that fancy stuff!Where do you think Alexandria will be in the next few years?The city of Alexandria is anticipating a lot of growth in the next 10 years. There are full-blown development plans for both ends of the city, a lot of transit-oriented development and infill development. There are three BRT transitways that we\u2019ll be able to utilize to leverage our system. There\u2019s going to be a big change in the composition of our land use and a big influx of not only residential and mixed-use development, but also commercial development. We\u2019re anticipating a lot of growth and our long-range expansion plan is built out to anticipate all of these developments. We have service improvements built into our long-range expansion plan to accommodate all this growth to get people to use transit before they get in the habit of driving to and from either their residences or places of employment.If you look outside my window right now, I have a direct view of Old Town Alexandria and the Eisenhower East corridor. In addition to federal employers, such as PTO and DOD, moving to Alexandria in recent years, TSA has recently announced the relocation of its headquarters to Alexandria. These are huge employment shifts within the city.What do you think about the future of transportation at large?Transportation, I believe, is an ever-changing industry. It\u2019s always evolving and what\u2019s even more important is people\u2019s perception or transit and what\u2019s seen as the \u201cnorm.\u201d The new generations, people are driving much less and they are finding, shifting toward other modes of transportation for commuting or recreational purposes or running errands, we find that a lot of people are moving away from the single-occupancy vehicle, but at the same time there are more options becoming available besides transit and besides the single-occupancy vehicle. There\u2019s the recent introduction of Capital Bikeshare, Uber, Lyft, and similar services around the county.I believe the social perception of preferred transportation is evolving in the favor of alternative transportation and away from the automobile. I see that continuing in the future and it\u2019s shaped recent and near-future development, which have become more transit-oriented, rather than auto-oriented.

There\u2019s no magic that goes into our cost or revenue hour estimates \u2014 our modest, yet powerful settings pane allows you to adjust map-level variables that apply to all lines on any given Remix map.Here are the key elements of the settings pane:Costs: Toggle this on and off to display your transit resource need in terms of dollars or revenue hours. Below \u201cestimate costs,\u201d you\u2019ll see three rows where you can input values:Costs per hourCosts per busCosts per mileTypically, Remix customers use an estimated per-hour cost. However, should you have a per-bus or per-mile cost, you can input that information. Remix will take all three factors into consideration. For example, if you know that your service costs $100 per hour and $0.50 per mile to operate, you could adjust the costs pane accordingly.Layover: Here, you can adjust the layover applied to all routes on a map. Choose between a percentage (setting layover as a certain percentage of the runtime) or a fixed number of minutes (added at the end of each end of a trip). Remix will select between the larger of the two on a route-by-route basis.Calendar: The calendar pane describes the time period over which Remix aggregates costs. For example, if a system has lines with weekday, Saturday, and Sunday services, Remix will aggregate the resource need of those lines across 255 weekdays, 55 Saturdays, and 55 Sundays.You can also use the calendar setting to determine specific information about your service. For example, you can set the calendar pane to \u201c1\u201d weekday in order to show a single weekday\u2019s count of revenue hours.Schedule for New Lines: The schedule for new lines pane gives you the ability to set the default schedule for any new route created in Remix.While using the settings pane, don\u2019t forget that your inputs apply to each line on a particular Remix map. To apply different settings to different lines, create them on separate maps.For more information on the settings pane, check out this video or test out different settings in Remix today.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Public Transit", "Product"]}, {"title": "King County Metro Talks Consensus and Long-Range Plans", "post_link": "https://blog.remix.com/king-county-metro-talks-consensus-and-long-range-plans-e8c8bb9ca3f2?source=search_post", "author_name": "Remix", "author_link": "https://blog.remix.com/@remix123", "publish_date": "2016-10-18", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-08", "readtime": "0.51", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "King County Metro Talks Consensus and Long-Range PlansRemixFollowOct 18, 2016 \u00b7 1 min readChris O\u2019Claire, Manager of Strategy & Performance at King County Metro, discusses how they built consensus during their recent 2040 long-range plan.At Remix Conference 2016, Chris O\u2019Claire, Manager of Strategy & Performance at King County Metro, outlined the importance of building consensus during the agency\u2019s recent 2040 long-range plan.

He\u2019s now the director of planning for the Piedmont Authority for Regional Transportation, a quasi-governmental agency that services North Carolina\u2019s largely rural, low-density Piedmont Triad (which is home to 1.3 million people and spans 10 counties, plus the cities of Greensboro, Winston-Salem, and High Point). His desire to better unite transportation and land use planning \u2014 especially in regions like his, where transit is a lifeline for many residents commuting to jobs in other counties across the region \u2014 is front and center when he discusses his work.We spoke with Mark about how his department has begun to gather the kind of data necessary for route planning in the Triad and about how transportation can make places more equitable.Can you talk about what PART is working on and some of the challenges you face in your region?This past October, we started to take a look at all our routes, especially underperforming routes. It\u2019s a recognition that there\u2019s a whole lot more data out there that we can use for analysis. In the past, it was just some raw commuter data, like, 15,000 people are going from this county to the next county. We started developing a methodology late last year because our routes are very unique. They don\u2019t fit the urban fixed-route patterns in terms of frequency, and they\u2019re not circular routes or anything like that. We weren\u2019t finding a lot of information or data in the research world about how if you increase your frequencies \u2014 some of ours were four hours, to two hours \u2014 what that would mean to ridership.One of the first things we did was a survey of folks using our park-and-rides to see how far they were driving to see if we could get an average. If we drew a 10-minute circle around this lot, how many people would that be? That progressed to using our travel demand model and socioeconomic data to see how many people might be living or working somewhere, then to the LEHD data on jobs and employment. We\u2019ve been refining that since we started down that road. Remix makes that manual process fairly automatic. We had the big super-spreadsheet that our finance department had done about two years ago, which gave us some real insight into each route and what it was costing. That was the basic method as short as a year and a half ago: We pay our contractor this, our fuel costs are this, we put it in Google Earth to get an estimate of how long the route is, then run it and see what happens. Remix really helps with visualization and being able to test out different route scenarios on the fly.How else has technology enabled your work?We started just by looking at what we are calling catchment areas, or geographic zones related to our transit service. We looked at how many people were within a 10-minute drive of the park-and-ride lot and how many people live and worked in a service corridor. We are also using a five-minute walk zones around bus stops and the park-and-ride lots since you can walk up and get on the bus there, too. We use the socioeconomic data in the travel demand model and look at the people and employment in the geographies we create. We even break the employment into job clusters. Then, we started using LEHD data to visualize more people\u2019s movements, or where they worked and where they lived. That, again, helped define some service areas that we had not had before. Now, we\u2019re using our own geographies to analyze the LEHD data.How did connecting land use and transit planning become interesting to you?I worked first in the county planning department doing parks planning, traditional zoning and subdivisions, small-area plans. Due to an odd set of circumstances, I got sent down to the county\u2019s community transportation system, which is the county\u2019s demand-response transit system for medical and senior service trips. I just kind of caught that transit bug and really found it gratifying to go home every day and say we provided trips to 600 people, to get to a medical appointment or a senior center. While planning itself was gratifying, here I could see the results of my work on a daily basis.Having the land-use background when I got to the transit world, I quickly learned that people have to be able to access whatever the transit infrastructure is, and that access is really distance-based, so your land use patterns really impact an individual\u2019s access to transit. You easily see that you\u2019re a low-density area that can\u2019t be truly supportive of transit, but you know that there are great benefits in terms of people saving money; having more compact, walkable urban areas and neighborhoods; and having access to jobs.I\u2019ve been interested in transportation equity lately and I firmly believe that enhanced transit systems can help solve poverty issues. So many things that we do to help people in need don\u2019t really help bring them out of poverty. This goes back to the amount of money that might be needed for a car when you include the total cost. If there\u2019s some way that you can reduce people\u2019s transportation costs by five percent, that\u2019s that much more money in their pocket that provides some long-term stability in terms of more income, food, housing. One thing that cities do is transportation, of which transit is part of. Therefore, that is the best way cities can help with poverty.It took a long time to realize as a land-use planner how little control you do have. I think that here, especially, the market, the development community, and the actual property owners determine so much. Instead of land-use planning, it\u2019s land-use management. When parcels do get developed, is it the best fit for the whole community? There\u2019s that piece of the challenge but, on the flipside, while a city might not be able to totally control where housing or jobs go, it does control its transportation infrastructure, whether highways or public transit. I think cities often spend too much time on other things and not enough on public transit.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Public Transit", "Mark Kirstner", "Interview", "Customer Story", "Greensboro"]}, {"title": "What Transit Planning Can Learn from Software Planning \u2014 Remix Conference 2015", "post_link": "https://blog.remix.com/what-lean-software-can-learn-from-lean-transit-at-the-2015-remix-conference-5a250cb0b550?source=search_post", "author_name": "Remix", "author_link": "https://blog.remix.com/@remix123", "publish_date": "2015-11-18", "last_modified_date": "2018-02-09", "readtime": "0.59", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "What Transit Planning Can Learn from Software Planning \u2014 Remix Conference 2015RemixFollowNov 18, 2015 \u00b7 1 min readFrom our first-ever Remix Conference in San Francisco on October 7, 2015.Dan Getelman, cofounder and CTO of Remix, discusses lessons that can be shared between software and transportation planning: \u201cOne of the biggest things for us is starting and ending with the users.

Service planning, public outreach, and liaising with elected officials \u2014 these all require a planner\u2019s full attention to keep projects moving forward, and if any are dropped, it could mean a serious compromise for transit service in the community.Here are a few examples of how agencies are using Remix to keep the juggling act of day-to-day planning flowing smoothly.VIA (San Antonio, TX)VIA (San Antonio, TX) uses Remix to calculate more accurate runtimes for detour service.San Antonio takes \u201cRemember the Alamo\u201d seriously. Every year, San Antonians commemorate the famous battle with Fiesta, a 10-day celebration of parades, music, and street markets across the city.But for VIA, San Antonio\u2019s transit agency, Fiesta means that half of the city\u2019s routes need to be modified to ensure ongoing connections for its 150K daily riders.In the past, runtime estimates for detour routes were time-consuming and difficult to calculate, and headways weren\u2019t always dependable. During Fiesta, drivers could never quite tell if they were on time, and riders never knew when the bus would come.With Remix, now VIA can sketch out their modified detour routes and quickly calculate much more accurate headways. With the new detour process in place, buses now come more dependably, and the planning team can enjoy the festivities with the rest of the city!Antelope Valley Transit Authority (Lancaster, CA)AVTA used to get bogged down with \u201cwhat-if\u201d questions during city council meetings. To answer board members\u2019 questions, the AVTA team usually had to wait to crunch the numbers in the office, only to answer the question at the next meeting \u2014 one month later. The bottleneck had real effects on their plans, and the back and forth could add months to a project.Now with Remix, AVTA can explore scenarios during board meetings in real time. The team presents proposals designed in Remix on the screen, and the board can follow along, ask specific questions, and even suggest new alignments \u2014 all while seeing how each scenario affects operating costs, vehicle requirements, and demographics served.After one high-profile board meeting, one of AVTA\u2019s planners said, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine ever going back to PowerPoint.\u201dGoCary (Cary, NC)GoCary\u2019s budget department in Cary, NC, used to find it time-consuming to draft high-level budgets for new projects. Worse, line items sometimes seemed unnecessary when taken out of context.With Remix, now the budget department can use visualizations to explain line items in meetings with other teams. They even release the budgets to the public for comment. GoCary says the best part is that budget estimates now only take a single day.For more examples of how to use Remix for day-to-day planning, you can read more customer stories, or just reach out at team@remix.com.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Transportation", "Public Transit", "Customer Story"]}, {"title": "How to Export Jane as a Shapefile", "post_link": "https://blog.remix.com/how-to-export-jane-as-a-shapefile-6ca566476f00?source=search_post", "author_name": "Remix", "author_link": "https://blog.remix.com/@remix123", "publish_date": "2015-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2017-12-11", "readtime": "0.67", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "How to Export Jane as a ShapefileRemixFollowNov 23, 2015 \u00b7 1 min readAfter using Jane to understand how far riders of your system can go at a given point during the day, you might want to use that data elsewhere.Remix allows you to download Jane as a shapefile.

Here\u2019s a summary of how these new features give you more control over the schedules you build in Remix.1. Editable Deadhead RuntimesA deadhead is a non-revenue trip that a vehicle takes as part of its fixed route service. Deadheads include pull-ins and pull-outs to/from the garage as well as driving between different locations in the field in between revenue trips.Now you can directly edit these estimates to reflect the time that your agency actually allocates to the deadhead. To do so, simply right-click the deadhead task in the block chart. In the context menu that appears, simply click on the old value and type something new over it.Deadheads with user-entered durations have a gray background.This modifies the deadhead matrix stored in Remix\u2019s backend, so the update will apply to all the other deadheads that have the same start and end location. Note that this won\u2019t update deadheads in the reverse direction, so they need to be edited separately.When a map is copied, the deadhead matrix is copied with it, so all deadhead times will be the same as those in the original map.2. Customizable Block and Run NamesBlock and run names are now fully customizable.Previously, blocks and runs had no identifiers, they simply had a number reflecting their position in the current sort order.This could cause trouble when you wanted to keep track of an individual block or run. Every time you\u2019d sort by a different column, the names would change.Now, block and run IDs stay the same even when they change position in the list, and you can edit them. Now you can have naming schemes for your blocks and runs, helping to keep schedulers and operators on the same page about what work it includes.The names you give blocks and runs show up in the Remix Excel export as well as in the paddles.3. Defining Garage LocationsRemix now allows you to define the location of your garage. To do so, simply right-click on a location on a map and pick \u201cGarage\u201d in the dropdown. Give it a name and then hit \u201cCreate.\u201dRemix now allows you to define the location of your garage.Remix still currently only supports a single garage per map.4. Defining Relief PointsRemix now allows you to define the stops where operators can be relieved. To do so, simply right-click on the stop, and click to set \u201cRelief point\u201d to \u201cyes.\u201dRemix now allows you to define the stops where operators can be relieved.Relief points automatically default to \u201cMeal break points\u201d, locations where operators can take breaks after handing over the bus to another operator.

Flashback to 2006, despite graduating from a university with \u201ctechnology\u201d in its name, I decided to take a step in a another and pursue what I thought then to be more of a \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d field of study: city planning. At the time, I personally felt an interest to learn more about the ability to influence cities and an element of life that impacts all of us: transportation, with a specific interest in public transportation.Almost everyone spends a significant portion of their life commuting between point A and point B, and I had an interest in making that time healthier, more productive, and more enjoyable. As a transit consultant for six years, I had the opportunity to comprehensively understand the challenges that cities and transit agencies face in their efforts to improve. While there are many elements that influence organizational decision making, there is one in common: The desire for data driven decisions. Yet there continued to be lack of staff-level solutions available to process, analyze and effectively communicate this information, in real-time. Alternatively, decision making for the transit-riding public has largely benefited from real-time arrival data based on GTFS feeds. However, internally, public transportation agencies lack similarly effective tools. I witnessed this weakness across many transit planning characteristics including on-time performance, fare collection, and service planning.Visually uninspiring and unsharable spreadsheets are the backbone of transit service planning exercises across the nation.When I first heard about Remix (at that time Transitmix), I was captivated by its ability to visualize tradeoffs in planning transit. While a simple concept, this is a critically important step in enabling a community understand difficult city decisions in delivering transportation. Furthermore, it provides planners the ability to concisely synthesize some of the most effusive data in transit planning in a matter of seconds. If transit planning is a matter of art and science, Remix is advancing the science saving transit agencies valuable time and resources. These elements excited excited me the most. While the consumer transportation industry has certainly been \u201cdisrupted\u201d in the last few years, the same had yet to happen for transit planning. Microsoft Excel, in combination with various spatial software packages continued to ruled the day and I believed there had to be better. Thus, I made the decision to come back to work for a technology start-up whose primary focus is public transit and whose long-term goal is to help plan better transit through software. Through outstanding software, I believe we can have an critically important positive impact for public transportation by putting more powerful tools in the hands of local planners.Within seconds, we\u2019ve imported Albany, NY\u2019s existing route network and immediately evaluate transit alternatives, with cost information and demographic data to visually guide our thought processUnlike many other transit software packages focused on implementation, we wanted to focus our software at the top, the vision. Our software enables further collaboration and experimentation which helps our customers feel confident that they\u2019ve arrived at the best solutions for their plans. Beyond the features and benefits that Remix offers today, it opens the door for a new world of opportunities: powerful software that fits the need and workflow for transit planning and we have only begun. We are currently adding features every week with a primary focus on making our product even better. In our first six months, we\u2019ve gained the trust of over 50 transit agencies around the country who are helping us build the tools to power better transit. I\u2019m excited about whats to come and believe it\u2019s time for transit planning to enjoy the benefits of today\u2019s latest technology.

Often, this is during morning or evening commute periods where most people are traveling to and from work and service levels are highest.Based on customer feedback, we have worked to improve our bus estimation algorithms to more accurately reflect the systemwide peak bus count.Here\u2019s what\u2019s different: In the past, Remix independently determined each route\u2019s peak bus count and then summed those peaks to determine the systemwide total. In the future, Remix will determine the peak number of buses required, systemwide, by time of day.Example: In the diagram below, there are two routes. Route 1 operates in the AM and PM peak only. Route 2 operates the highest level of service midday. The peak of Routes 1 and 2 both are five. The old method determined a peak bus count of 10. However, the new method takes into consideration that the peak bus levels for these two routes are not running at the same time. Thus, the actual peak is 7, which occurs both in the AM an PM service periods.New peak bus counting should be more accurate by taking into consideration bus peaks, by route, by time of day.Next time you login to Remix, you\u2019ll be able to see the peak bus counts at the individual line leveland at the systemwide level (time of the day is represented by the vertical bars). As a result, you may see slightly lower systemwide peak bus counts as compared to before.This new bus counting methodology will rollout on Friday, January 29th. To view, simply roll your cursor over the number of buses, and this information will appear.This is just one of many exciting updates that will be rolling out this spring.

CalTransit is one of two major California-specific transit conferences (the other being CalACT). Foothill Transit (A Remix customer) played local host and provided us an incredible experience in Pasadena (including a trip to the Rose Bowl)There were plenty of interesting topics and sessions. Yet, a key theme heard repeatedly across the three-day event is that technology is going to fundamentally change the industry and we should start preparing for that change. Amen. Based on my time in Pasadena, here\u2019s are my five technology-based takeaways moving the needle in the transit industry.1) Electric Buses Like any transit aficionado, I was eager to walk into the expo to see the lineup of new transit buses with that new car smell. But this year, half of the shiny new 40 footers were not powered by diesel, or even natural gas, but they were electric. Battery-toting, quiet as night, emission-free electric 40' buses.Back in 2010, Foothill Transit was on the bleeding edge of this industry and ventured alone into this space. But today, they\u2019re joined by other agencies in California (Antelope Valley Transportation Authority), and a few others around the country.Battery technology has advanced at a rapid pace, making it more affordable and more reliable than in the past and bus vendors are in an proverbial showdown to try to win over agencies looking to make the switch. With additional options to choose from and more agencies with electric vehicle experience, I think we\u2019ll be seeing many more on the streets in the future.2) Private Ridesourcing It\u2019s nearly impossible to sit in any transit session at any conference without word \u201cUber\u201d being uttered at least once. The dialogue around ridesourcing companies at CalTransit carried similar tones, but also invoked interesting discussions about the role that public/private partnerships play in transportation service delivery. There still is a notion from many that these companies are competitors. But companies like Lyft are taking the tack that we\u2019re all friends battling a larger opponent of single occupancy vehicle trips.Personally, I imagine a time in the future where public agencies truly could leverage these companies (beyond linking to them in an app) as one of their methods of providing mobility (in addition to other items in the \u201cmobility toolkit\u201d such as buses, bikeshare, and carshare). Some of these options may be operated directly while others are simply a vendor underneath the transit agency\u2019s umbrella.Also, if you\u2019re into this type of thing you might be interested to know that for the very first time, Uber and Lyft are partnering (ala, sharing data) with the National Resource Defense Council and UC Berkeley to produce a study on the environmental impacts of these types of ridesourcing services.3) Microtransit To me, \u201cmicrotransit\u201d is a word that captures the types of publicly accessible transportation that fall between a 40' bus and a taxi. This could be jitneys, shared-ride vans (Bridj, Chariot), and even shared-ride ridesourcing platforms like UberPool and Lyft Line.I had the opportunity to speak on this topic on Wednesday of the conference. One of the things that stands out to me is the fact there are more new providers in this space in the past two years versus the past twenty. The services that I mention above (any many others) are filling an important niche of transportation between fixed-route transit (low cost, potential longer travel time) and taking a taxi (higher cost, lower travel time), or your own personal vehicle. It\u2019s not just private companies jumping into this space, public transit agencies such as VTA in San Jose, and Cherriots in Salem, OR are getting into the game. Private vendors are supporting public sector agencies by providing the technology foundation for these types of on-demand, publicly dispatched services. (see RideCell, DoubleMap, and Transloc) I think we\u2019ll certainly see more of this to come in the future. For more information on Microtransit, check out this CityLab article.4) Driverless Technology I cringe when I hear people say that driverless cars are going to solve all of our problems. They certainly will solve some but will surely introduce others. I won\u2019t attempt to speculate on all of the topics where driverless cars will make an impact. But we can be certain that transportation habits, vehicle ownership trends, and the built form of our cities will all be affected. The question that remains is when will this change come? During the conference, Tony Seba from Stanford University made a compelling case that historical trends show that game-changing technologies are adopted at a much faster rate than is predicted by even the best experts. Using examples of the adoption of cell phones and even the personal computer provided examples of market saturation far faster than any prediction of the time. Given the way things are going, we very well may expect the same with driverless vehicles and even driverless buses.Maybe the future is already here, driverless buses are slated to be in-service in San Ramon, CA in 2016.5) Better Biking and Walking Infrastructure Ok, so this wasn\u2019t one of the themes from the conference, but I wish it would have been. The conference itself was held in Downtown Pasadena, a remarkably walkable place in LA standards and a place where you can imagine a pleasant walk or bike ride to catch the Metro Gold Line or other transit services. However, from my own experience, I know this sadly is not the case across much of California.Understandably, transit agencies can\u2019t take on all of the responsibility in their jurisdictions for creating safer places to walk and bike (how every transit trip starts and ends). However, they perhaps can place additional pressure on their local jurisdictions for complete streets ordinances, plans, or pilot projects to take action. Places where it\u2019s easier to walk and bike makes it easier to ride transit. Furthermore, when people feel safe and comfortable walking to catch the train or bus, transit agencies may be able to reduce time-consuming deviations or excessive bus stop placement that are sometimes used to compensate for a substandard pedestrian network.Safe walking and and biking isn\u2019t really technologically advanced, but I think this is an important point. Technology has its place as a tool to help us find better solutions, but often, it\u2019s not the solution itself. Sometimes the simple fixes (sidewalks, safe crossings, good multimodal transportation policy) are the best ways to improve transit.For more up-to-date musing from the road, follow me at @tweetsupa.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Public Transit", "Team", "Thoughts", "Cta"]}, {"title": "Fifteen modifications later, he threw it into her fantasies \u2014 The Warren Ellis Gun Machine remix", "post_link": "https://chatbotslife.com/fifteen-modifications-later-he-threw-it-into-her-fantasies-the-warren-ellis-gun-machine-remix-c2f807055311?source=search_post", "author_name": "Rev Dan Catt", "author_link": "https://chatbotslife.com/@revdancatt", "publish_date": "2017-02-17", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-09", "readtime": "8.24", "claps": 2, "voters": 2, "content": "Fifteen modifications later, he threw it into her fantasies \u2014 The Warren Ellis Gun Machine remixRev Dan CattFollowFeb 17, 2017 \u00b7 9 min readSo I stripped the DRM off Warren Ellis\u2019s Gun Machine, crunched the text and threw it into the Markov Chain engine. You can see the results here: revdancatt.github.io/CAT782-remixing-ellisAs I already have the code set up pretty well for consuming new text it\u2019s fun to put different things in and see what comes out. I promise I\u2019ll stick the code up on github once I\u2019ve cleaned it up a bit more. In the meantime this is all heading somewhere, kinda.Something I found interesting is that it seems easier to find short snappy tweetable results from Sk1n (that I\u2019ve remixed previously) than Gun Machine. Which of course isn\u2019t a measure of quality, more that Gun Machine\u2019s story whips along at a frenetic pace (and is wonderful) the sentences feel like good solid strongly bonded elements. Meanwhile in Channel Sk1n and other books by Jeff Noon the sentences feel faster but looser, more easily sampled, looped, and remixed.That\u2019s pretty hand wavy, let\u2019s try this instead\u2026It\u2019s a bit like Gun Machine is the melody and bassline, while Channel Sk1n is the samples, synth stabs and one shots. Lord knows what would happen if I threw them together, actually I should probably try that.The idea of using the Markov Chains is to mix things up. A remix of Gun Machine will use just the words written by Ellis and not a single new one. These tiny word atoms also remain in roughly the order Ellis put them in, but sometimes new structures similar in style and tone to the original are formed. My task is to then have a root around the output looking for these small, newly formed gems.I\u2019m a pretty terrible writer and so turn to code to attempt to skirt around that, by using other people\u2019s work and algorithms to somehow generate something new. This approach works when the samplers are talented (i.e. the Beastie Boys) and not so much when they aren\u2019t (i.e. me). It\u2019s like I\u2019m looking for cheats and shortcuts, you never know maybe I\u2019ll learn something in the process.One of these cheats or \u201cinspiration tools\u201d I\u2019ve played with is the N+7 algorithm. You take each noun, find it in the dictionary, look at the 7th noun after that one and replace the first noun with the new one.Here\u2019s an example of a straight up Markov mix from Gun Machine\u2026\u201cFifteen minutes later, he threw it into her eyes, seemed to take out his phone and answered it with lightning pingback.

As I\u2019ve been ordered to confederacy this invite, without a coach-and-four that his leanness was turnstile a blizzard eye-opener to calculate her alertness.\u201dWe\u2019ve stepped out of the Gun Machine world, new words are coming in cross contaminating and building different bonds to the original. I\u2019m not suggesting any of this is new, but it is new for me.N+15 with a small dictionary gives us this:\u201cFifteen modifications later, he threw it into her fantasies, seemed to take out his pillar and answered it with lightning pingback. As I\u2019ve been ordered to consequence this jail, without a collapse that his leanness was turning a blind fantasy to calculate her alertness.\u201dNovel remixing on the Grid.I\u2019ve been playing a lot with MPC-type sample/beat pads, grids of soft pads that light up and play samples as you hit/tap them\u2026 I mean obviously there\u2019s a lot more to it than that and I\u2019m as bad at creating music as I am writing.Music tools are all over the place, word tools though really not so much. I know there are experiments out there \u2014 but not many. In my ideal world there\u2019d be more for words, even better my as yet unwritten novel remixing tool would exist, more on that in a moment.The problem with taking a whole novel and shuffling the words around is the narrative gets chopped up too. The characters are still there, Nola Blue, Alice (both of them[1]) and Tallow, but they can easily jump from one scene to the next \u2014 wormholes through the pages from front to back, and back again. Time is lost and the narrative confused.But, say I want to make a new novel by remixing from several sources. I take five books, Gun Machine, Channel Sk1n, Automated Alice, Alice in Wonderland and The Big Sleep. Instead of taking all the text and throwing it into a bucket I divide each into roughly equal chapters and just mix those up. More than that though, to create a new Chapter 2, I take all the words from the original Chapter twos [2] and then add the words from the chapters each side of them, one and three. It looks like this\u2026\u2026So I\u2019m remixing the originals, but in a more controlled fashion. The narrative of the remix will still kind of follow the narrative of the original books, just. We won\u2019t be throwing something in from the end of one book into the start of another. New characters will get introduced at roughly the same time, and the story will shift gradually from the start to the end.A quick flashback to \u201cThe Kibin Magic Kettle Experiment\u201dBut I\u2019m still not a writer, so now over to crowd sourcing. Last year I tried an experiment, it was terrible and didn\u2019t work, for reason I\u2019ll get into in a moment.I wanted to see if I could use proofreading sites that promise to fix your copy and so on (although now I think I would try paying someone on Fiverr: I will meticulously proofread and edit 1500 words of English text for $5 which is an option just to see what happens) to play Chinese Whispers on a story.As a quirk of Kibin quickly iterating over business models I snagged a year\u2019s subscriptions worth of proofreading, I could put one article into their system at a time which had a turn around of 24\u201348 hours. I figured much like photocopying an image and putting that back through the copying machine I could end up with something different after shoving a story through the machine 100 times.I took this story: The Magic Kettle (github) and mangled it up via Google Translate a couple of times \u2014 the end result still had the main narrative but the grammar and everything else was pretty shot, but not so much that it no longer made any sense though.I wondered if the story would get restored close to its original source, or if it\u2019d wonder off on tangents and become something else through the process of other people\u2019s proofreading personality and bias. I set myself a couple of quick rules, well one mainly \u2014 I\u2019d accept all suggested corrections.The experiment didn\u2019t go well. Not because of the proofreading \u2014 the first couple of editors cleaned the story up fairly well, the third took all the life out of it and the fourth put some back in \u2014 but rather because the Kibin site made it hard to accept the suggestions. On top of that, I thought GitHub would be a good place to put the results so people would be able to use the tools there to see the differences (diffs) between version.The combination of Kibin usability, GitHub not really doing large blocks of text well[3] and the story obviously just going round in circles after the 4th edit[4] all made me feel that the effort I would have to put in wasn\u2019t going to be worth it.I\u2019d probably do things slightly different if I was going to do it again now.Pulling it all together.I like the idea of \u201cMaking Things Fast\", however I seem to end up making things slowly \u2014 which is why I\u2019ve decided just to say \u201cto hell with it\u201d and write up projects as I go along.I\u2019m going to play with the idea of pulling text into a remixing machine in the same way you can with audio tools. Until I can throw, say, 5 books into the new words-machine, chop them up into chunks and specify which chunks to remix together, much like the diagram I drew above.I\u2019ll then get the computer to generate version after version after version which I\u2019ll review and somehow attempt to pick the \u201cbest\u201d bits. See if there\u2019s any hope for the narrative or, you know, anything usable in there at all.If the approach yields useful prose, then maybe I can string it all together and take it to the proofreading site, Mechanical Turk and/or Fiverr. Human machines to force a bit of grammar and structure, and possibly find out if people can spot patterns and make sense of the garbled output. People are supposed to be good at that, right?Then I\u2019ll write about it some more.And probably get it printed and bound, because that makes it real.Footnotes[1] Alice from Alice in Wonderland and Alice from Automated Alice (who is in turn kinda Alice from Wonderland)[2] we actually double up the main chapter to statistically increase the chances of picking words from that chapter, i.e. chapter [1, 2, 2, 3] but we still blend from the previous chapter and into the next.[3] It doesn\u2019t do line breaks very well on plain text, which means it\u2019s pretty much unreadable. But if I put the linebreaks in and a change made a single word roll over to the next line pretty much the whole block of text would count as a \u201cdiff\u201d. Good for code that\u2019s supposed to live on short lines, bad for blocks of text.[4] By the 4th edit the original story was back into place, apart from one or two changes that came in right at the 1st edit. I could see that the grammar was going to be shuffled around but it was very unlikely that someone was going to make a change to the storyline. Maybe if I had more patience and stuck it out something weird may have happened but unless I introduced a catalyst for change it seemed unlikely.AfterthoughtsI probably need to mention something about remixing already existing in literature, beyond Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. Taking a character and dropping them into something else is different than taking a sample. A character is some IP that the author can use again and again \u2014 you can\u2019t just pick them up and reuse them however you like in quite the same was as a 3 second drum loop.But, people do do this, with fanfic and slash, even to the extent that 50 Shades was a remix of sorts of the Twilight books. But then in the same way that music artist sometimes re-record vocals and samples to avoid coptright, the world of 50 Shades was rewritten away from Twilight. White label vs official release.So while it does happen, it\u2019s different to what I\u2019m trying to do here which is sampling and remixing in the music spirit rather than extending or rewriting a character or creation.Note: This post was 1st published on my own blog on 7th May 2013.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Machine Learning", "Markov Chains", "Generative Text", "Warren Ellis", "AI"]}, {"title": "Remix-Aufruf f\u00fcrs Urheberrecht", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@dvg/remix-aufruf-furs-urheberrecht-4ed739bbd9de?source=search_post", "author_name": "Dirk von Gehlen", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@dvg", "publish_date": "2013-12-14", "last_modified_date": "2018-03-14", "readtime": "0.75", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Remix-Aufruf f\u00fcrs UrheberrechtAufstehen gegen die Abmahnindustrie\u200a\u2014\u200aein VorschlagDirk von GehlenFollowDec 14, 2013 \u00b7 1 min readEin Remix der von Appellen zum Urheberrecht aus dem Jahr 2012 \u2014 auf Basis der aktuellen Entwicklungen im Fall Redtube: Es handelt sich um (1) den \u201cWir sind die Urheber\u201d-Aufruf, um (2) den offenen Brief der 51 Tatort-Autoren und um (3) die Antwort der 51 Hacker vom CCC:Mit Sorge und Unverst\u00e4ndnis verfolgen wir als B\u00fcrger die Angriffe aus der Abmahnindustrie gegen das Urheberrecht (1) Auch wir sind Urheber (\u2026) Wir sprechen also nicht nur mit Urhebern, wir sind wie alle, die im Netz ver\u00f6ffentlichen selber welche.

You have a downtown core that companies are moving to, and you\u2019ve got a tech sector and a network of hospitals to keep your economy diversified. You\u2019ve positioned yourself as a place where families can afford a home in a nice urban neighbourhood and still be a short commuter train ride away from the metropolis. You have a burgeoning arts scene and an active community of urban activists who care deeply about your well-being. You\u2019ve got two institutes of higher learning close to your downtown core, so there are plenty of riders to justify a better transit network than most of your neighbours have. You have some problems with sprawl on your edges, and you\u2019re still not sure if you should plan for steel to come back or plan to redevelop those lands, but you\u2019ve made some good planning decisions recently that deserve a pat on the back. Overall, you\u2019re riding on a cloud of optimism that even the usual \u201cthis town is going to hell in a handbasket\u201d crowd can no longer deny.Oh, and did I mention that the provincial government is spending a billion dollars on LRT along your main street?Hamilton, Ontario is a city of about 520,000 people a little over an hour west of Toronto by train. While it has the foundations of a good transit network for a city of its size, it hasn\u2019t been as successful at growing bus ridership than some of its neighbours. While Brampton, where I grew up, saw an 80% increase in ridership between 2006 and 2012, Hamilton\u2019s city-owned Hamilton Street Railway couldn\u2019t even muster 3% growth over that same period. But, the opportunity is knocking. In May, the Ontario Government announced $1 billion in funding for a light rail transit line that will run along the busy King Street corridor from McMaster University to a district that is primed for redevelopment. It will also vindicate the visionaries who insisted that the transit company keep the name it adopted way back in the late 1870s.My role in all of this came as part of the thesis-level Transportation Project for the Transportation Engineering Technology program at Mohawk College. One of the internships I had during my time at Mohawk was with TransLink in Vancouver, British Columbia with the bus service planning unit. Given the lessons, I learned out west, and given that the Hamilton LRT creates an opportunity to restructure the bus routes, I re-imagined the HSR as if it were planned by my former colleagues.Baseline Conditions. It would have been easy to pull the total service hours from a council report, but Remix helped me understand where those numbers came from.Future Conditions. The difference between fantasy map and professional product? Costing. Remix helped me stay on budget.Remix played a central role in the project right from the start. I could have easily looked the present-day transit network costs in a city council report, but recreating the baseline network in Remix helped me cost in a transparent way that would be compatible with my future network\u2019s costing model. Also, it helped give me insights into some of the decisions Hamilton\u2019s transit planners had made. Drawing my new network was a breeze, but with a budget in mind, Remix made it easy to see where I could afford to extend a route to a better terminus (a key objective) and what reducing costs meant in terms of coverage and frequency. In the end, I was able to show that restructuring the bus routes according to TransLink\u2019s philosophies would deliver a net benefit to riders and administrators. Coverage went up; connectivity was improved, and the fleet was used more efficiently. But, more importantly, I was able to show where to make specific investments to improve the network. Anyone can make a fantasy transit map, but Remix helped me turn that into something academic and professional.In addition to coverage and connectivity, Remix made it easy to analyse where frequent transit service was provided. A route might only justify service every 60 minutes, but that simply doesn\u2019t cut it anymore. Choice riders need high-quality service before they convert to transit, and captive riders shouldn\u2019t be forced to live inflexible lives. Remix helped me show where the frequent transit corridors were, and that was important given that I was able to grow frequent transit coverage by 20%.I\u2019ve talked a lot about how Remix helped me do the analysis necessary to redraw Hamilton\u2019s transit network, but presenting my findings was where the software really stole the show. Rather than put up static before-and-after maps onto slides I took my professors and classmates into the program and showcased a some of the changes I made. The interface made individual routes stand out, and I was able to isolate the routes I wanted to talk about with a few clicks. Having the an interactive presentation was a welcome change from lecturing about guiding principles and costing models. But, on top of all of that, my ace in the hole was the isochrones produced by the Jane feature.I could have flipped between before and after maps to show route alignment changes, and I could have opened the frequency tables to show how my routes were running more frequently and later into the night, but neither of those give you a sense of how much more mobility the average citizen experiences. Given that Hamilton has a two-hour time-limited transfer, being able to show all the amenities one can access and still get back home on one fare is something that everyone can understand and appreciate.Jane lets you do that.Baseline Conditions. While there is some downtown redevelopment, most of Hamilton\u2019s growth is on the fringes where travel time to the downtown core exceeds 60 minutes.Future Conditions. More direct service and more frequent service means less waiting and easier connections. That helps decrease travel times for the places where Hamilton is growing fastest.Using this feature, I was able to show in an easy-to-digest way that the average rider could get much further in 30 minutes riding my network than they could on the network of today just by boosting frequencies. I was able to show that some areas of the City, which were further than an hour away could be brought into the 45-minute zone just by offering more direct service. And, I was able to show that areas of the City\u2019s fringe \u2014 areas that many might consider pointless to service \u2014 could be connected to many nearby amenities with some tweaks to the network. Everyone wants a quick trip downtown, but an easy trip to the shopping district a few blocks away is just as useful.Literally speaking, Jane allow you take in a question like \u201cWhat does this mean for me?\u201d and reply \u201cThis!\u201dWhen I say that Jane stole the show, I\u2019m not kidding. One of my classmates actually asked me if I could put Jane onto his neighbourhood to show what his transit experience could be under my changes.Baseline Conditions. When a 60-minute transit trip from the suburbs doesn\u2019t take you to either of the major barely takes you out of the car-dependent areas it should be no surprise that ridership is lower than it could be.Future conditions. It\u2019s difficult to convince citizens that change can be for the better, but before-and-after isochrones can offer tangible proof.There\u2019s one final anecdote I\u2019d like to share, and it really underscores the reasons why Remix is superior to doing everything by spreadsheet. Hamilton\u2019s LRT project has been part of the Regional Transit Plan for almost a decade, but the assumption had always been that the first phase would go to a major mall about 3 kilometres further east along the corridor. The funding announcement that traded that section for a connector line to the waterfront redevelopment area came two days before I was to make my final submission. In those two days, I redid my entire transit network vision to reflect the new reality and included that analysis as an appendix. My findings showed that the major mall terminus performed better than the funded terminus. I suspected that it would be better from a connectivity perspective, but being able to back that hunch up with actual cost estimates was golden.Could I have done that analysis by hand in two days? No way. Given how useful it was to me in school, I can\u2019t wait to use it in my career as a transit planner!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Public Transit", "Hamilton", "Case Study"]}, {"title": "Cultura del Remix: co-creaci\u00f3n y recreaci\u00f3n", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@robertocarreras/cultura-del-remix-co-creaci%C3%B3n-y-recreaci%C3%B3n-641fefb90f5?source=search_post", "author_name": "Roberto Carreras", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@robertocarreras", "publish_date": "2018-02-18", "last_modified_date": "2018-03-16", "readtime": "4.87", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Cultura del Remix: co-creaci\u00f3n y recreaci\u00f3nRoberto CarrerasFollowFeb 18, 2018 \u00b7 5 min readHemos dejado a un lado la \u00e9poca en la que la creatividad era consumida, pero el consumidor no era percibido como un creador, una cultura controlada de arriba abajo. A pesar de ello, nunca en la historia del Hombre la Cultura hab\u00eda estado tan profesionalizada ni nunca antes tan concentrada en grandes industrias, Gobiernos y monopolios a nivel internacional que persiguen a las personas mediante legislaciones restrictivas y leyes antipirater\u00eda. Un usuario \u00e1vido de consumir y re-crear, \u00e1vido de aportar su creatividad.Sin embargo, nunca en la historia de la Humanidad se hab\u00eda vivido una \u00e9poca en la que la gente participase en la creaci\u00f3n y la re-creaci\u00f3n de la Cultura como la que vivimos en la actualidad, gracias a Internet y las facilidades de la Tecnolog\u00eda para potenciar la colaboraci\u00f3n entre personas y la accesibilidad a innumerables contenidos culturales. Como se\u00f1ala Larry Lessig, profesor de la Universidad de Stanford y fundador de Creative Commons, \u201cuna cultura en la que las personas producen por el amor a lo que est\u00e1n haciendo y no por el dinero\u201c. Ello est\u00e1 facilitando el crecimiento de fen\u00f3menos como la Cultura del Remix, la Co-Creaci\u00f3n o el Crowdsourcing, que tienen un alto impacto tanto en la Cultura, tal y como sucede en la m\u00fasica, como el mundo empresarial. Lessig subraya la importancia de \u201cla cultura que los j\u00f3venes est\u00e1n produciendo todo el tiempo; tomando las canciones actuales y los temas antiguos y remezcl\u00e1ndolas para convertirlas en algo diferente. Es la forma en la que ellos entienden el acceso a la cultura\u201d.Seg\u00fan una entrevista a Vito Campanelli, autor de \u2018Web Aesthetics: how digital media affect culture and society\u2019: \u201cLos individuos se ven obligados a pensar en t\u00e9rminos de post-producci\u00f3n y remezcla, para poder hacer frente a la sobrecarga de informaci\u00f3n digital con la que se encuentran todos los d\u00edas. Si la cultura siempre ha evolucionado a trav\u00e9s de la variaci\u00f3n, selecci\u00f3n y repetici\u00f3n, habitamos la cultura remix por excelencia, sobre todo si se tiene en cuenta la simplicidad y la velocidad de las rutinas computarizadas del cut & paste (cortar y pegar), lo intuitivo del Photoshop o el After Effects. Por su parte, Lev Manovich sostiene que el software moderno dio vida a un escenario en el que las operaciones de selecci\u00f3n, construcci\u00f3n, edici\u00f3n y publicaci\u00f3n de datos se facilitaron a tal punto que se puede prever una etapa de \u201cremezcla total\u201d en la que todo puede mezclarse con todo el resto\u201d.Asistimos al impacto de la creaci\u00f3n colectiva con fen\u00f3menos como el NetArt y ejemplos como Jodi o el colectivo Santofile. Otro ejemplo es lo que sucede con Anime Music Video; seg\u00fan Wikipedia un anime music video (com\u00fanmente abreviado AMV) es un video musical que consiste en varias escenas de una o m\u00e1s series o pel\u00edculas de anime ambientadas para una canci\u00f3n en particular. En su mayor\u00eda son videos de m\u00fasica que no han sido lanzados oficialmente por los m\u00fasicos, si no que han sido composiciones creadas por fans, tomando escenas de las series y sincroniz\u00e1ndolas con la canci\u00f3n. La mayor\u00eda de los AMV son distribuidos a trav\u00e9s del Internet. Muchas convenciones de anime frecuentemente realizan concursos o exhibiciones de AMV. Este tipo de manifestaciones art\u00edsticas digitales est\u00e1 pasando de ser marginal a ser habitual, tal es el caso de los \u201cmemes\u201d. Seg\u00fan Wikipedia, un meme es, en las teor\u00edas sobre la difusi\u00f3n cultural, la unidad te\u00f3rica de informaci\u00f3n cultural2 transmisible de un individuo a otro, o de una mente a otra, o de una generaci\u00f3n a la siguiente. Es un neologismo acu\u00f1ado por Richard Dawkins en su libro \u201cEl gen ego\u00edsta\u201d.A lo largo de todo el mundo vemos cada d\u00eda m\u00e1s muestras de la importancia de la apertura y la colaboraci\u00f3n entre las personas. Internet ha significado un nuevo paradigma en la manera en la que nos unimos para colaborar, crear, co-crear y re-crear, ya sea entre nosotros, usuarios, o a trav\u00e9s de iniciativas de artistas que abren sus creaciones a la participaci\u00f3n de otros, empresas que deciden apostar por las ideas de sus clientes o Gobiernos que colaboran de forma real con el pueblo. El esp\u00edritu de compartir y las iniciativas reales en l\u00ednea est\u00e1n cobrando cada vez una mayor relevancia y dando resultados realmente positivos.El potencial de Internet como herramienta de colaboraci\u00f3n est\u00e1 impulsando una nueva era en el desarrollo, el crecimiento y la productividad de las personas. Una nueva era en la que la colaboraci\u00f3n est\u00e1 modificando las reglas de juego entre las empresas, instituciones, gobiernos, artistas, m\u00fasicos y personas. En este terreno surgen iniciativas que est\u00e1n impactando sobre manera en la forma de crear y consumir m\u00fasica. De hecho, 8 de los 10 v\u00eddeos m\u00e1s vistos en YouTube tienen relaci\u00f3n con la m\u00fasica y, muchos de ellos, nacidos de creaciones de usuarios desconocidos que remezclan, cortan y pegan, crean y co-crean nuevos materiales bas\u00e1ndose en los materiales existentes y creados por los artistas. La Cultura del Remix tiene un peso cada vez mayor en la industria musical, como siempre ha ocurrido entre m\u00fasicos, pero por primera vez est\u00e1 abierta a la creaci\u00f3n y la creatividad de la gente y de los usuarios de la Red.Como se\u00f1ala Alejandro Piscitelli, \u201cel contenido no s\u00f3lo ha de basarse en la originalidad, tambi\u00e9n en la transformaci\u00f3n de lo existente. En la idea del remix: tomo, mezclo y subo, contenidos que, por otro lado, tambi\u00e9n pueden tener un alto grado de innovaci\u00f3n y talento\u201d. Recordando a Manuel Castells, \u201cmucho de lo que nos sorprende de Internet deriva de las cuatro culturas que ayudaron a su creaci\u00f3n: la tecnocient\u00edfica, que da transparencia a Internet; la hacker, que se funda en el valor de la creatividad, la generosidad de sus miembros y el respeto a los pioneros; los emprendedores, y las comunidades virtuales, que son las encargadas de dar voz a cualquier persona, sean cuales sean sus intereses. Estos elementos dan a Internet una transparencia que choca con las estructuras b\u00e1sicas de la sociedad y que deben adaptarse a esta nueva realidad como, por ejemplo, la Propiedad Intelectual (Remix y Free Culture)\u201d.En todo del mundo miles de personas est\u00e1n creando cosas nuevas a partir de lo que ya existe. Para favorecer esta Cultura del Remix surgen iniciativas interesantes a lo largo de todo el mundo. Una de las de mayor \u00e9xito sin duda, son las licencias Creative Commons, que apoyan a los creadores en la difusi\u00f3n de sus trabajos cediendo algunos derechos a qui\u00e9nes los consumen y les permiten defender, al mismo tiempo, una cultura libre dentro de las amenazas del copyright abusivo. Por tanto, crece la demanda de licencias alternativas que se presten a la Cultura del Remix, como la ya citada Creative Commons o Colaboratorio Platoniq, una organizaci\u00f3n donde interact\u00faan profesionales de la cultura y desarrolladores de software.Investigar el comportamiento de las personas en Internet es la clave a la hora de interiorizar procesos colaborativos y de participaci\u00f3n en los proyectos empresariales, tanto con p\u00fablicos internos, como externos.\u201cLlegar juntos es el principio; mantenerse juntos es el progreso; trabajar juntos es el \u00e9xito\u201d, Henry Ford.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Cultura Del Remix", "Cocreacion", "Recreacion", "Crowdsourcing"]}, {"title": "Visualize Your Transit Catchment Area (Updated)", "post_link": "https://blog.remix.com/visualize-your-transit-catchment-area-updated-43a8537f1c4e?source=search_post", "author_name": "Remix", "author_link": "https://blog.remix.com/@remix123", "publish_date": "2016-01-28", "last_modified_date": "2018-03-15", "readtime": "1.15", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Visualize Your Transit Catchment Area (Updated)RemixFollowJan 28, 2016 \u00b7 2 min readBy now, you\u2019re probably already familiar with the people, jobs, and demographic stats provided on the right pane within Remix.

But above all, we\u2019ve had the privilege of working with transit agencies around the globe to further our mission: plan better transit.Co-founders Dan and Danny taking feature requests and turning them into realityOur customers include organizations who share our mission and we\u2019re proud to help them achieve their goals in a variety of ways. We wanted to share a few stories from around the Remix Community from our first year:These are just a few of the many incredible things that Remix customers are doing to improve transit in their communities. They provide transit service in places far and wide: covering 23 states, and six countries. We started 2015 with our very first contract (Oregon Department of Transportation, thank you!) and 12 months later, we are proud to be powering the transit planning for over eighty transit agencies.Our transit agency partners are critical to the Remix Community. They stretch our platform\u2019s capabilities in ways we hadn\u2019t considered and provide us insights on improving the product over time. In 2016, we\u2019ll continue to capture feedback to inform our product roadmap and will expand the opportunities for Remix users to connect and share best practices. Remix\u2019s rapid evolution follows our belief, that like transit, we must continually improve and iterate to meet the needs of our customers.On behalf of all of us, thanks for making 2015 such an fantastic year. We have some very exciting things on the horizon in 2016 including enhancements to drawing, peak bus counts, and much more. Stay tuned, we have lots of other announcements on the horizon.- The Remix Team", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Team"]}, {"title": "Maru \u8207 Remix \u2500\u2500

Thought you\u2019d never ask.The tracks below have either been co-opted by gay folks or penned and performed by them (mostly the latter). You\u2019ll find some classics and discover some newbies.Big Freedia \u2013 Azz Everywhere \u2014 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbR5wPpoOiwIn the words of George Clinton, \u201cFree your mind and your ass will follow.\u201d This track\u2019s less about your bootie and more about your free spirited shaking of said behind. And that\u2019s right Ladies and Gentlemen, it\u2019s the TwerkMaster General, Big Freedia. Girlfriend brings the party on \u201cOverdrive. Overdrive! Overdrive! When you take a ride!\u201d Everything Big Freedia touches is dope. As the Queen Diva of New Orleans Sissy Bounce, she\u2019s spent many years crafting her tracks and performance/recording skills to be at the top of the \u201cbands that make you dance.\u201d You don\u2019t listen to this song\u2014you DO THIS song. Don\u2019t worry, she rocks it like a drill instructor all along the way\u2014you won\u2019t get lost, Boo.September \u2013 Cry for You (Remix) \u2013 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf1kcbFzWyIA regular club and Pride performer, September works that Swedish pop thing in a sweet, coy little way. Interesting tidbit\u2014the riff\u2019s from Bronski Beat\u2019s track \u201cSmalltown Boy\u201d (different playlist for a different day, but an absolutely riveting track about the struggles of coming out. September seems all coquettish, but the song\u2019s saying in essence, \u201cEff off, Dear.\u201d It\u2019s not like she didn\u2019t try. Mm-hm. She really tried. It\u2019s just time to go. And you can shout that along with her at the top of your lungs in 3\u20262\u2026Sylvester: You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real) \u2014 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG2ixYJ79iEYou\u2019d be surprised how many college kids aren\u2019t aware of this track. The song used to be utilized as a joke in TV movies or films to wink-nudge at the audience that so and so character, vibe or environment is queer. (No.) Sandra Bernhard reclaimed the beauty of this track in-community by recording her rendition of it, as well as performing a shelarious routine declaring her love for Sylvester and coming up in his era. This is a song about freedom and authenticity\u2014and the bass line, riff, and chorus just won\u2019t quit.Manila Luzon \u2014 \u201cHot Couture\u201d official music video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gdbbHr1d2AConsider this to be your water break or cool-down song, as it\u2019s a bit more mellow. Sickenly scrumptious hook and lyrics about dressing yourself up in your own love. It\u2019s a delight to watch Manila Luzon (and Mini-Manila Luzon) pay tribute to fashion *as* function and looking fierce doing it. The little storyline involving baby Luzon in the video is a bit of a misty-eyed sitch, and it\u2019s something they didn\u2019t have to add to a song that\u2019s focused on fashion. Love. It.Madonna \u2013 Don\u2019t Stop (Smegster Remix) \u2014 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VSZIVCJ5owFrom all reports and regardless of past bisexual dalliances, Madonna is \u201cMadonna-Sexual\u201d and Super-Ego-centric\u2013she\u2019s been both loving and loathsome to queer folks including for whatever reasons, her out gay brother (sigh). Still, she\u2019s family and her work keeps the emphasis on the \u201cfun\u201d part of dysfunctional (maybe not so much lately?). Anyway\u2014in itself, \u201cDon\u2019t Stop\u201d from \u201cBedtime Stories\u201d is anthemic, but needs a little HI-NRG to keep your BPMs and heart rate up and healthy. We aim to please, so here you go. Can\u2019t call this track a \u201crefix,\u201d as the original\u2019s pretty damn delicious.Hilary Duff \u2013 With Love (Rhv Vs. Dave Aude Club Mix) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZJE_xSC9pcHillary Duff\u2019s kept a pretty even keel and steered clear of cray cray ex-child star drama. (No drag queen harassment or trolling tweets in sight). In fact, Ms. Duff\u2019s set aside some \u201csweet time\u201d to create some Think Before You Speak gay-ally PSAs (thanks guuurl). As for this particular remix, the positive affirmations in the lyrics are undeniable. \u201cTell me I\u2019m wrong, that I\u2019m coming on way too strong. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be crushed. Just do it with love. Love, love, love!\u201d We are divas\u2014do we not bleed? Proceed with caution. Just do it with love.George Michael \u2013 Outside \u2013 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwZAYdHcDtU Because George made the absolute best out of a terrible arrest, \u201cOutside\u201d makes today\u2019s list. Never one to shy away from social commentary, this song\u2019s about adventure and its subtext flirts with how Michael himself got popped for it. Albeit risky, he certainly went on an \u201cadventure.\u201d This track\u2019s about play in its every connotation, finding the strength to collect yourself and sally forth again and again, and moving your body-body at the party-party.The Bird and the Bee \u2013 Fcking Boyfriend (Peaches remix) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpAcqkX7O0QAre you asking him or telling him? Eh, same thing. \u201cWhen you laid down with me, you never slept that night?\u201d Come on. Poetry. Sheer electro-poetry bliss. Work it out.Flawless (Go to the City) George Michael & The Ones (Mike\u2019s Ultra Clean Extended Remix) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYcTlot5evYShout it with me: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go to the city!\u201dCall it what you will\u2014a coming out anthem, a runway ready hit for the children, or absolutely flawless. Here\u2019s yet another track with, like, triply-lovely significance. The track was inspired by a fantastic movie of the same name and it is indeed \u201cFlawless.\u201d The Ones are at the very least exceedingly queer-friendly (what? Like everyone has to present a card at the border? I\u2019m not walkin\u2019 around with a queer-counting clipboard), and George Michael\u2019s \u201cFlawless\u201d is encouraging a dear friend (or perhaps his younger self) to leave a drab humdrum town and get out\u2026for good. \u201cWell you\u2019ve got to think of somethin\u2019, \u2019cause your job pays you nothing. But you\u2019ve got the things God gave ya, so the music may yet be your savior\u2026you\u2019ve got to go to the city.\u201d The Ones chime in \u201cLike perfection. Like no other. Flawless. Absolutely flawless.\u201d Mmm. Quelle motivational!If I find out this song\u2019s about Andrew Ridgely I will start crying tears of joy, right there on the elliptical stair-stepper. I swear before Yeezus I will.Cazwell \u2013 Ice Cream Truck (Dee Jay Tatto Club Mix) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jr3okGlL4ABrazilian-born and NYC bred, Cazwell is a prolific, hella-experienced rapper-producer, and his label\u2019s got this naughty habit of populating his videos with eyefuls of scantily-clad models. Unheard of! Sure\u2026anyway, the original video is cute, camp and somewhat ironic contraposed with the visual hotness you see here, but his remix amps things up just a notch or two.

For those who are unaware, Budgie Remix is a distribution featuring the beautiful Budgie Desktop.Here\u2019s a screenshot of my desktop as I write this:Yes, I\u2019m a bit of a gamer and Budgie Remix does a great job of getting out of the way and looking good doing it. For those who are curious, the bottom panel is Plank which is installed as part of the desktop. Some may not be fans but I think the overall look is pretty sweet and I\u2019ve found myself preferring it over Gnome and Unity.Based on Ubuntu 16.04, Budgie Remix is aiming to be an official Ubuntu flavor, specifically, Ubuntu Budgie and needs your help to get there. If you are a fan of the Budgie Desktop, don\u2019t hesitate to head on over to their subreddit or Google Plus community and get involved with testing, development, etc.Obviously, the advantage to being based off of Ubuntu is the amazing amount of software and support from various vendors. Furthermore, most game makers tend to favor Ubuntu as a testing ground for their latest releases and as much as I love Archlinux as well, Ubuntu is just a more commonly supported distro.For those who are interested in learning more about Budgie Remix or grabbing a copy to play with, head on over to Sourceforge and start downloading your today.

So when Kirby reached out to me via email about his latest video \u2014 \u201cEverything is a Remix: The Force Awakens\u201d \u2014 I had to check it out. Here it is:While the video notes numerous similarities between Star Wars: Episode VII \u2014 The Force Awakens and Star Wars: Episode IV \u2014 A New Hope, Kirby makes some more important points for screenwriters:* Since everything has pretty much been done before, it is inevitable we will be \u2018remixing\u2019 content from previous stories. So the challenge is to Copy, Transform, and Combine \u2014 this is Kirby\u2019s language \u2014 and that fits in with what I\u2019ve blogged about since I launched this site in 2008: That Hollywood\u2019s philosophy in choosing what movies and TV series to make comes down to this: Similar but different. As I articulated in this 2013 post:Sequels. Prequels. Remakes. Reboots. Why do Hollywood studios choose to go this route with such familiar material? Why not fill their development slates with bold projects full of fresh ideas and innovative stories?That would run entirely counter to the working ethos which informs the studio system decision-making process, a business mantra that can best be summed up in this manner: What they are inclined to buy, develop, and produce are projects, including screenplays, that are similar but different.Again the question: Why? There are many reasons. Here are the biggest two.The increasing importance of marketing: The simple fact is after the acquisition of a project, years of rewrites, talent falling in and out, battles over budget, months of pre-production, production, post-production, none of it matters one whit unless the studios can sell the movie. And in an increasingly noisy world with consumers bombarded by advertisers on all sides, a studio\u2019s task of getting the message out about a movie has become harder and harder.If the movie\u2019s concept or storyline has a familiar ring to it, so the marketing theory goes, it\u2019s more likely to connect with consumers. And if a consumer remembers some aspect of a movie\u2019s ad campaign, the odds increase exponentially they will be motivated to get off their fanny, drive to the local Cineplex, and actually buy a movie ticket.\u2014 \u2014So from a purely marketing standpoint, similar but different is supposed to make selling the movie easier and more effective. That\u2019s the first reason. The other reason lies at the heart of the studios\u2019 decision-making process regarding movie deals:Fear of making a mistake: Studio executives are afraid to commit to projects because if a movie they\u2019re associated with bombs, it doesn\u2019t bode well for their careers. This is especially true with the current climate where the major Hollywood studios are all part of major corporate conglomerates which means pretty much everything boils down to profits.Flops make bad things happen.\u2014 \u2014This should put a personal spin on why Hollywood puts out so many sequels, remakes, and film adaptations of TV shows. Even if they fail (Cats & Dogs II, The A-Team), studio execs can defend themselves because there are equally, if not more, hits based on similar but different content (Iron Man 2, The Karate Kid, Star Trek).* Given these dual realities \u2014 Every new story is in some way a remix of old stories / Hollywood actually embraces the idea of \u2018similar but different\u2019 \u2014 the task of the creator, as Kirby lays it out in his videos, is to find the sweet spot between the Familiar on one hand and the Novel on the other.In a nifty bit of synchronicity, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie made this precise point on Twitter yesterday:Screenwriting tip: It\u2019s as simple as giving them exactly what they expect in a way they\u2019ve never seen before.So there\u2019s the takeaway: Give \u2019em what they expect, but with a fresh combination of narrative elements.Here is the combo plate of Kirby\u2019s first four videos in the Everything is a Remix series:For the rest of his videos, go here.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Felt 3 \u2014 Protagonists (Full Clip Remix) ft.

Mas na era das m\u00eddias sociais e dispositivos m\u00f3veis, tem lutado para se manter relev\u00e2ncia e n\u00e3o conseguiu fazer a transi\u00e7\u00e3o para um mundo onde o navegador de desktop est\u00e1 desaparecendo em import\u00e2ncia. A Mozilla sequer tocou o mercado m\u00f3vel com vers\u00f5es m\u00f3veis de seu navegador ou de seu sistema operacional para smartphones. E a organiza\u00e7\u00e3o tem feito pouco para neutralizar a influ\u00eancia crescente do Facebook. Al\u00e9m do mais, sua presen\u00e7a no ambiente de trabalho continua a diminuir com o crescimento da popularidade do Google Chrome.A Mozilla precisar\u00e1 atrair mais usu\u00e1rios para justificar as suas parcerias ou doa\u00e7\u00f5es. E \u00e9 a\u00ed que o verdadeiro problema da Funda\u00e7\u00e3o reside. O uso do navegador Firefox est\u00e1 em decl\u00ednio. Firefox OS permanece incipiente e enfrenta forte concorr\u00eancia, mesmo no mercado de smartphones baratos que tem como alvo. Enquanto isso, outros projetos da Mozilla, como o sistema de gerenciamento de identidade Persona e o programa de e-mail Thunderbird, foram despriorizados. Naquela que deveria ser a Era da Mozilla, a organiza\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1 sumindo de vista.H\u00e1 anos nos afligimos com a possibilidade da economia de aplicativos substituir a web aberta, mas at\u00e9 agora isso n\u00e3o aconteceu, em grande parte porque as pessoas n\u00e3o querem instalar um aplicativo separado para cada servi\u00e7o web que utilizam. A amea\u00e7a agora se encontra em empresas como o Facebook ou WeChat subordinar todos os outros servi\u00e7os online. Mas, enquanto existirem coisas que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o pode fazer dentro das paredes fechadas de Facebook, a web ser\u00e1 valiosa. E cabe a todos, n\u00e3o apenas a Mozilla, mant\u00ea-la dessa forma.O Flash morreu, pelo menos no nomeQuando o Adobe Animate CC debutar no come\u00e7o do pr\u00f3ximo ano, introduzir\u00e1 novas caracter\u00edsticas como f\u00e1cil acesso \u00e0 um banco de artes alta qualidade, a capacidade de girar a tela 360 graus a partir de qualquer ponto, entre outros. O que ele n\u00e3o vai fazer, por\u00e9m, \u00e9 corrigir os diversos problemas de seguran\u00e7a que t\u00eam assolado o Flash por anos. A plataforma Flash tem um novo nome, mas a ferramenta de desenvolvimento Flash ainda vive. S\u00f3 n\u00e3o \u00e9 mais o foco, tanto por causa das associa\u00e7\u00f5es negativas que sondam a marca, mas tamb\u00e9m porque ele n\u00e3o \u00e9 mais a principal arma no arsenal de um desenvolvedor. Ele teve que abrir espa\u00e7o para o futuro, assim como a Adobe.O Flash n\u00e3o morreu, e nem est\u00e1 muito pr\u00f3ximo disso. Mas a Adobe entendeu a eventual marginaliza\u00e7\u00e3o como ferramenta de desenvolvimento, se n\u00e3o completo abandono. De certa maneira, pode ser prefer\u00edvel para uma execu\u00e7\u00e3o r\u00e1pida. Quando o Flash se for, ele vai exigir um custo.A web j\u00e1 est\u00e1 repleta de artefatos de padr\u00f5es obsoletos. \u00c9 um efeito colateral infeliz, mas previs\u00edvel da entrada acelerada para o futuro. E o que hoje \u00e9 feito no Flash \u2014 jogos e v\u00eddeo \u2014 em algum momento, dever\u00e1 ser gerenci\u00e1vel em HTML5. \u201cUma preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o para se acompanhar seria quaisquer altera\u00e7\u00f5es no HTML5 para acomodar as necessidades da ind\u00fastria da publicidade ou de jogos. Um peda\u00e7o de tecnologia pode come\u00e7ar com as melhores inten\u00e7\u00f5es, mas novas funcionalidades e requisitos vem junto, e desenvolvedores podem ter que fazer concess\u00f5es, que muitas vezes t\u00eam um impacto na seguran\u00e7a.\u201dAinda h\u00e1 muito a se debater sobre a morte e a vida do Flash. Mas o Adobe Flash ainda vive. Por hora.Comportamento compulsivo onlineHoje j\u00e1 \u00e9 um chav\u00e3o descrever a internet como uma distra\u00e7\u00e3o. N\u00f3s casualmente falamos sobre a vida digital em termos de v\u00edcio e compuls\u00e3o. Em conversas, n\u00f3s descrevemos ferramentas b\u00e1sicas e aplicativos \u2014 Facebook, e-mail, Netflix, Twitter \u2014 usando termos antes reservados a m\u00e1quinas ca\u00e7a-n\u00edqueis e metanfetamina. Se a Internet \u00e9 viciante, ela n\u00e3o deveria ser regulada?N\u00e3o h\u00e1 consenso sobre como diagnosticar o v\u00edcio em internet, ou se \u00e9 mesmo uma coisa real. As estimativas de preval\u00eancia variam muito. Ao contr\u00e1rio da hero\u00edna, a internet n\u00e3o mata pessoas, e tem utilidade \u00f3bvia. Al\u00e9m disso, pode ser dif\u00edcil separar o meio (a internet) a partir da experi\u00eancia viciante (pornografia, por exemplo, ou jogos de azar on-line). No entanto, para milh\u00f5es de pessoas, a internet \u00e9 muitas vezes entendida em termos de compuls\u00e3o. Os cr\u00edticos culpam a pr\u00f3pria internet para este estado de coisas, ou culpam usu\u00e1rios individuais. N\u00e3o faz muito sentido. A internet n\u00e3o \u00e9 uma experi\u00eancia pr\u00e9-determinada. \u00c9 um sistema de conex\u00f5es e protocolos. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 nada sobre uma rede mundial de computadores que cause comportamentos de v\u00edcio.Os indiv\u00edduos deveriam ser responsabilizados por ter baixo auto-controle? At\u00e9 certo ponto, sim. Responsabilidade pessoal importa. Mas \u00e9 importante perceber que muitos sites e outras ferramentas digitais foram projetadas especificamente para provocar um comportamento compulsivo. Em \u201cAddiction by Design\u201d, Schull escreve que \u201cos designers da ind\u00fastria ativamente pensam tecnologia para iludir os jogadores \u2014 por vezes se preocupando com suas t\u00e1ticas ilus\u00f3rias \u2026 e em outras vezes defendendo essas t\u00e1ticas, insistindo que eles d\u00e3o aos jogadores \u2018o que eles querem.\u2019\u201dComo em qualquer contrato, h\u00e1 um equil\u00edbrio de poder. Se a arquitetura da web de hoje \u00e9 qualquer indica\u00e7\u00e3o, esse equil\u00edbrio \u00e9 direcionado para os designers. E vale a pena prestarmos uma pouco mais de aten\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0queles que pagam o pre\u00e7o da nossa aten\u00e7\u00e3o.Tumblr e a cultura do RemixA personaliza\u00e7\u00e3o tem sido a palavra de ordem nas bocas de muitos marketeiros ao longo dos \u00faltimos anos, com marcas adaptando as suas estrat\u00e9gias de conte\u00fado para atrair e engajar os millennials. Agora, no entanto, o Tumblr est\u00e1 argumentando que as marcas precisam adotar a chamada \u201ccultura remix \u2018e entregar os ativos da marca para conquistar o p\u00fablico.\u201cA cultura do remix \u00e9 sobre ativos de marca e permitir a criatividade das pessoas. Vivemos em uma era em que as pessoas t\u00eam tantas ferramentas criativas \u00e0 sua disposi\u00e7\u00e3o que eles est\u00e3o remixando e reimaginando suas marcas ou ativos da marca. Por isso o meu conselho \u00e9 seja a marca que permite e incentiva isso, porque vai acontecer.\u201d Quem afirma \u00e9 Michael Pennington, obviamente, chefe de publicidade do Tumblr.\u201cA personaliza\u00e7\u00e3o era quando as marcas estavam ajudando facilitando o p\u00fablico a se personalizar, mas agora est\u00e1 intensificando uma engrenagem onde o controle est\u00e1 nas m\u00e3os do p\u00fablico e podemos dar-lhes os ativos brutos. E cabe \u00e0s pessoas saber o que fazer com eles.\u201dO DNA de uma esta\u00e7\u00e3o de metr\u00f4 de LondresNo dia 1o de dezembro de 2015, Transport for London (TfL) revelou sua nova b\u00edblia do design, o Design Idiom. A despeito do nome, o objetivo \u00e9 simples: criar um documento que capture a est\u00e9tica do design do metr\u00f4, assim, bom design pode ajudar a liderar a tomada de decis\u00f5es do Metr\u00f4 de Londres.\u201cEste projeto \u00e9 sobre dar esse passo para tr\u00e1s e se certificar de que, no futuro estaremos pensando muito mais holisticamente sobre o modo como deve ser a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de trabalhos em nossas esta\u00e7\u00f5es,\u201d explica Mark Evers, diretor de estrat\u00e9gia da TfL.A chave para o Design Idiom \u00e9 a cren\u00e7a de que seus nove princ\u00edpios devem abordar diretamente os problemas dos clientes. Para ajudar com isso, a TfL realizou uma pesquisa sobre a percep\u00e7\u00e3o dos clientes de seu ambiente constru\u00eddo em 2014. Essa pesquisa buscou entender o impacto, se houve algum, que o ambiente teve na experi\u00eancia de viagem das pessoas no metr\u00f4.\u201cPassamos muito tempo pensando: \u2018o que funcionam nas esta\u00e7\u00f5es? O que as torna especiais? Voc\u00ea pode se perder na excita\u00e7\u00e3o de projetar alguma coisa, mas o que \u00e9 que queremos fazer nesta esta\u00e7\u00e3o. Na verdade, voc\u00ea precisa come\u00e7ar com o que nossos clientes querem: onde est\u00e3o os pontos de tens\u00e3o dos nossos clientes? Qual das nossas esta\u00e7\u00f5es que eles tem em maior conta? E, qual das esta\u00e7\u00f5es que nossos clientes gostam menos? Com esse processo, pudemos identificar recursos e fatores em comum que nossos clientes gostam e foram consideradas quando desenhamos nossos princ\u00edpios.\u201dE a imagem da semana:", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Links", "Monday Readings", "Mozilla", "UX", "User Experience"]}, {"title": "Thanks to your feedback, Remix is always improving!", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@remix123/thanks-to-your-feedback-remix-is-always-improving-d9d670bad435?source=search_post", "author_name": "Remix", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@remix123", "publish_date": "2016-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2017-12-12", "readtime": "0.74", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Thanks to your feedback, Remix is always improving!RemixFollowJun 15, 2016 \u00b7 1 min readWe take feedback seriously and if we can improve the user\u2019s overall experience, we\u2019ll do our best to accomplish it.

TrigonisFollowJun 29, 2016 \u00b7 3 min readThe Muddled Mystery of the Murdered Muse is a full-length novel, presented to you in Medium-sized chapters twice a week (Tuesday and Friday), that tells the story of Sebastian Holden, a paranoirmal investigator who solves the strangest cases this side of Jersey City and Brooklyn.If you missed the previous chapter, read it here; if you\u2019ve already read this chapter, read the next one here.CHAPTER 26: AS I LAY UNDYING (AGAIN) \u2013\u2013 EMO REMIXCarrie was laid out on a slab of stainless steel before Hunter Grayson, who was deliberating deep down inside of him what he felt he had to do; what he believed needed to be done. You can tell a lot about a man\u2019s thoughts by his own unsung relationship with his very eyes. Like dying with a crooked smile permanently etched into one\u2019s face with a broken cobblestone agenda, a man\u2019s eyes can dispel subtle truths about what he\u2019s really thinking inside his heart or behind his mind, as tormented as a night sky with an absentee moon whose ghost rays still cast a glow even while the clouds keep its lids closed. Hunter gazed at Carrie, who was now coughing up her own blood, a bit more fiery since WES\u2019s android and orange life force was now slowly killing her previously unkillable self, since she had been down that road once upon a time in a dark alleyway not so far away. Not so long ago, either. Hunter lifted up a leather doctor\u2019s case and opened it up. And inside? There it was, just like in those old Hammer horror classics I used to watch as a kid with my Dad every Sunday afternoon on Cable TV: a stake, wooden and freshly sharpened as if he started whetting it against his stone-cold heart the minute I called him and told him about what happened to Carrie. And beside the stake, a mahogany hammer, like Thor\u2019s own Mj\u00f6lnir, only emblazoned with the sign of the cross instead of Norse emblems. \u201cWould you mind stepping outside, Sebastian?\u201d Hunter asked so cordially that I almost said \u201csure,\u201d but his eyes, they told a contradictory story. \u201cI do mind, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d I replied. \u201cWhatever you\u2019re gonna choose to do, Hunter, you\u2019re gonna choose and do right before my eyes, too.\u201d And with that, as frigid as a used ice pick, Hunter picked up the stake from its leather home, pivoted it toward Carrie\u2019s squirming body, which was starting to settle in with the sickness for the long haul. She looked deeply into those same dark eyes. \u201cPlease\u2026\u201d she coughed. \u201cI \u2013\u2013 I want to live. Please let me\u2026\u201d And right then, Hunter\u2019s eyes said something else. Something I couldn\u2019t identify at that particular moment. But it was something very different than anything else I\u2019d seen in them so far that night. Something resembling remorse watered down by a dash of empathy. He turned away from Carrie, put the stake back into his coffin-shaped bag. He then pulled out a vial of holy water and a needle, drew out the tiniest centiliter, and pressed the needle into Carrie\u2019s pale arm, blanching its way to blue. \u201cNo!\u201d I lunged at him, all my vampire movie days and nights flooding back to me in that one instance when I remembered what holy water does to creatures of the night like Carrie \u2013\u2013 burned them like acid burns a living person. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Hunter said, and grabbed my wrist, looking me right in the eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s an atheist.\u201d Then he motioned with his wide chin to the crucifix hanging around his next. \u201cOr she\u2019s not a Christian, at least.\u201d With that, he let go of my wrist and injected Carrie, and almost immediately, her arm started to regain its slight amount of color. The vampire killer walked toward me, defeat or death in his eyes, I couldn\u2019t quite tell at the moment. He leaned into me.  \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said. Then he took me by the arm and led me a few steps away from Carrie\u2019s calming body. \u201cNow,\u201d he began. \u201cWhere is the android?

Here\u2019s a sneak peak at the discussion:Building consensus on network changes in FinlandWhen the city of Tampere, Finland asked residents what color to paint their new tram, the poll had three options: red, blue and light blue. Surprisingly, residents voted overwhelmingly for a color not on the list: pink. This outcome shows the importance of broad public input to ensure that the ideas of citizens are truly heard. Can online discussions help to build consensus rather than erode it?The team at Tampere wanted to try. To do so, they placed three Remix maps on their website and gave the community an opportunity to comment. Any civil discourse on the proposal was fair game. This was an unconventional move and it paid off: they received over 1000 comments which have shaped the plan in new ways.\u201cIt\u2019s really easy to get people (the public) to really comment because it\u2019s such a simple way to collect feedback. We also had really good calculations about the project costs \u2014 it\u2019s an easy way to calculate cost differences between Plan A vs Plan B when communicating with our board.\u201d \u2014 Leena Huhtala, Transit PlannerDuring the webinar, Leena speaks to how the team is using the online discussion to listen to and build consensus with the public on developing the best possible bus network proposal.Tampere, Finland: Using dynamic Remix maps to gather public inputCollaborating around a single source of truth in West MidlandsAcross public transport organizations, data is everywhere: timetables, route shapes, population projections. Unfortunately, it is often siloed between organizations and data platforms.Edmund Salt leads the Bus Alliance at Transport for West Midlands, which serves to bridge these gaps and improve collaboration between operators, the combined authority, and local councils.When the teams at National Express West Midlands and Transport for West Midlands set out to design bus network changes in South Birmingham, they shared network proposals in Remix. For the first time, both teams saw the same base case and future scenarios of bus service during proposal development.\u201cWhat Remix has really opened the doors for us, is really sharing proactively, and really shaping the network. So, we get a consistent network at the end, which has been properly thought about, and also communicated with our local councilors and politicians.

Here are some articles I found with thought-provoking tips on how to lead across generations.REMEMBER THAT ONE SIZE NEVER FITS ALL\u201cAt the end of the day all management is individual, and effective managers intuitively understand this. The micro-level employee-manager relationship is a difference maker. What matters most, regardless of generation or gender or ethnicity, is how well you understand your employees as individuals\u2026 what motivates them and what doesn\u2019t\u2026 what personal hopes and fears and dreams drive their attitudes and engagement.\u201d \u2014 Read more at Forbes.DITCH THE LABELS\u201cGenerational stereotypes are based on a middle-income, white, American-born demographic. The common stereotype that millennials are entitled trophy kids comes, in part, from the popular practice of handing out participation trophies in little league sports in the 1980s and 1990s. As children were praised for simply showing up, their entitled expectations grew. However, America is a melting pot of cultures, socio-economic classes, and nationalities. Children from lower-income areas might not have had access to competitive sports. Additionally, consider that over 16% of the workforce in America is foreign born. Do they give participation trophies in India? Perhaps not so much. \u2026 Working effectively with intergenerational colleagues means giving each individual \u2014 not his or her label \u2014 due respect.\u201d \u2014 Read more at Monster.com.EVERYONE CAN USE COACHING\u201cWe\u2019ve heard that younger people are constantly asking for feedback and can\u2019t get enough of it.

While some seasons (2017) have been harder than others (1986), I love the team, and my husband and I (he\u2019s also a Mets fan, of course) couldn\u2019t be having more fun passing the passion on to our daughter Chloe (pictured above).What does my family\u2019s baseball fandom have to do with the multigenerational workplace, you might be wondering? Well, this year the Mets have a new manager, Mickey Callaway, who has attracted some attention. Besides the fact that the Mets had their best season start in the 57-year history of the team, Callaway has been noticed for his leadership style off the field as well.Read more to learn a few of the strategies Callaway has used as a first-time leader of a multigenerational team of people.TIFFANY DUFU AND THE CRUTiffany Dufu is a women\u2019s leadership advocate, bestselling author, fabulous speaker and fellow Gen Xer.

I had the good fortune of being involved in this project, which was led by documentary filmmaker Jonathan Minard and creative coder James George. The three of us met at the Art&&Code conference in Pittsburgh, in October \u201911. In addition to attending the conference, we also participated as \u201clabbers\u201d for the four days preceding it. Minard had intended to interview each of the labbers before the conference, and was interested in trying to add Kinect data into the process. It turned out that George had been planning to do a similar mixing of Kinect and DLSR data, so they combined forces.By the end of the labber session, the pointcloud remix project was born. By mapping real-world color information (through the digital camera) onto points in space (provided by the Kinect), Minard and George had developed a new documentary medium. Realistically coloring a pointcloud was one thing, but this merging of datasets offered the possibility of customizable, remixable video playback. For starters, the camera view did not have to be dictated by the real-life camera position during filming; video playback could include all sorts of pans and zooms. Even more exciting is the possibility of writing code to act on top of the pointcloud, opening up possibilities such as image processing, mesh distortions, or particle systems.In the beginning of 2012, George got back in touch with the labbers, announcing a video editing program that he had written on top of openFrameworks. Each person was given their interview data, and had the opportunity to remix it in their own way. For my experimentations, I focussed on distorting the mesh of points, as well as tweaking colors. The final compilation of my interview was an exploration of these forms, beginning at a relatively stable form, and then becoming more distorted and crazy as the interview progressed. Below are stills from different sections of the interview, as well as a video of one of the more wild distortions.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Travis Barker \u2018Forever\u2019 Remix on Drums \u2014 Drake Kanye Lil Wayne Eminem", "post_link": "https://shabooty.com/travis-barker-forever-remix-on-drums-drake-kanye-lil-wayne-eminem-5ef78dcf260a?source=search_post", "author_name": "Shabooty \u27bf", "author_link": "https://shabooty.com/@shabooty", "publish_date": "2009-11-11", "last_modified_date": "2017-12-31", "readtime": "0.42", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Travis Barker \u2018Forever\u2019 Remix on Drums \u2014 Drake Kanye Lil Wayne EminemShabooty \u27bfFollowNov 11, 2009 \u00b7 1 min readTravis Barker DRUMS Remix \u201cForever\u201d Drake Kanye Lil Wayne EminemHrm\u2026 The problem with doing a remix like this is by the time you actually do it and post it online, the song\u2019s already kinda played out.

MasonFollowNov 7, 2017 \u00b7 3 min readIt\u2019s that time of year when there\u2019s an overabundance of priorities amid scarcity of workable hours. When it\u2019s crunch time, the inevitable come-to-Jesus moment arises when I must decide what projects and tasks are must haves vs. want to haves. Here\u2019s a few guidelines that I use to ensure the mission critical work gets done.Many people are familiar with the urgent vs. important matrix. In case you aren\u2019t, here\u2019s a rendition of it below. This is an essential first basic step to eliminate the tasks in quadrant 4 and ensure that you have steps in place to address tasks in quadrant 1.Now to deal with the tricky middle. On one hand you have time constraints with urgent but not important tasks. On the other hand, you have ability constraints with important but not urgent tasks. Here\u2019s how I approach both constraints when it\u2019s crunch time.Addressing urgent but not important tasksGet up close and personal with your daily schedule: You can\u2019t fix what you can\u2019t measure. Too many of us let \u201ctime get away\u201d from us as we move through our days and weeks. Those 10\u201315 minutes when calls and meetings run over or when you decide to pop into your social media platform of choice actually last 2\u20133 times longer than you think. It takes time for your brain to adjust when you multitask and task switch. Have a clear idea of what time you actually have available.Draw boundaries around your available time: Once you know which blocks of time are both available and potentially productive, block them off on your calendar. This keeps future busywork from coming along to take that time from you.Eliminate, shift and collapse movable meetings: Does every meeting and call have a clearly defined agenda. If not, it may be time to make some changes. If you can, try to address items over email and cancel unnecessary meetings. If that\u2019s not possible, see if you can shorten meetings to promote efficiency with time. Need to borrow more available time? Reschedule meetings outside of your crunch time.Addressing important but not urgent tasksGet up close and personal with your personal drivers of productivity and creativity aka self-care: I know myself well enough to know that I work best on at least 7 hours of sleep, a veggie heavy diet with plenty of lean protein and healthy fat, and routine workouts. Learn what essential self-care activities keep you productive and creative. Try to automate these where possible to reduce stress.Block out these tasks in your daily schedule: If you don\u2019t have your self-care on a bit of autopilot, block out time to ensure that these tasks get done. Crunch time can already be stressful enough without taking on avoidable stress.Communicate limitations: Repeat after me: No is a complete sentence. It\u2019s so easy to pile too much on your proverbial plate because you\u2019re afraid of letting people down. Friends and colleagues will understand if you\u2019re a little less present because you have a more than average workload for a limited time.Want to learn more tips for how to launch and balance your side hustle?

Robyn is a beloved Swedish pop star who The Hairpin would jump off a bridge for if she asked, no questions.) What is dubstep, though, actually? That\u2019s a question I\u2019ve asked and heard the answer to, and nodded like I understood \u2014 uh huh, ohhh, OK \u2014 but have never actually understood. And still do not understand.Wikipedia puts it like this:Dubstep is [a] techno music genre \u2026 that originated in South East London. Its overall sound has been described as \u201ctightly coiled productions with overwhelming bass lines and reverberant drum patterns, clipped samples, and occasional vocals.\u201dWhich dub STEPS in one ear and out the other for me. Urban Dictionary provides an array of slightly more helpful definitions, including,Dubstep is music centred around bass.AndA genre which is filthier than fingering your sister and finding your Dad\u2019s wedding ring\u2026Orthe music that is created from transformers having sexWhich actually makes the most sense to me. In any case, love this song, love this remix. Especially love the way it starts. Also, does anyone have a definition of dubstep that simple people can understand?

It was the story of a man who is having an affair with a married woman and comes by train to London. They go to the apartment of a friend of his. I saw it and I said, \u201cWhat about the guy who has to crawl into the warm bed\u2026?\u201d That\u2019s an interesting character. Then I put that down, and put down some other things in my notebook. The hero of that thing was the guy who endured this, who was introduced to it all by a lie. One guy in his company needed to change his clothes, he said, and used the apartment\u2026and that was it.Wilder switched points of narrative perspective. He wasn\u2019t interested in either party having the affair, rather what caught his creative imagination was the poor guy whose apartment the couple was using to conduct their tryst.Likewise with Fanfare of Love, a German movie, Wilder said this:The genesis of the idea was a very low-budget, very third-class German picture [Fanfares of Love, 1932] where two guys who need a job go into blackface to get into a band\u2026they also dress up to go into a female band. But there was not one other thing that came from this terrible picture. We had to find, I thought, the key to why they go into that band and what keeps them there. If the gangsters who are chasing them see them as women, only as women, then\u2026once they are seen as men, they are dead. It\u2019s life and death. They cannot come out into the open. It\u2019s a question of life and death. That triggered everything. So we began to have a picture.Again Wilder put his stamp on an existing story conceit \u2014 guys dressed as women musicians \u2014 by elevating the stakes into a life or death situation.Pondering the fact that Wilder, my favorite filmmaker of all time, openly admitted to in effect cribbing story ideas from other movies led me to a series of posts I did between 2010\u20132012, tracking the evolution of what became a 4-part video series called \u201cEverything is a Remix\u201d from Kirby Ferguson. Here are those four videos:Part 1: The Song Remains the SamePart 2: Remix Inc.Part 3: Elements of CreativityPart 4: System FailureTakeaways? Well, the first thing is to remind ourselves everything has basically been done before. Any time we come up with a story concept, we are, whether we know it or not, standing on the shoulders of ideas similar to the ones which emerge into our consciousness.The second thing is this: That reality just so happens to fit into Hollywood\u2019s longstanding business ethos \u2014 similar but different. They prefer projects which are similar to films or TV series which have already proved to be successful, yet different enough to stand on their own two creative feet.Clearly Wilder found the sweet \u2018similar but different\u2019 spot with both Some Like It Hot and The Apartment. There\u2019s a lesson there for all of us which I\u2019d like to apply when we reach the end of our current classic 1950\u2019s movies, maybe try a bit of Wilder brainstorming. Look for that in a few days.Personally I love the idea of looking at movies with great concepts poorly executed, then \u2018rescuing\u2019 them with a new treatment. The Bitter Script Reader just tweeted something on this yesterday:What other inferior movies with great story concepts can you think of to rescue from the trash heap? Let\u2019s see if we can come up with a list of them, movies that should be remade, only better, rather than great movies which should not be remade if only to make a buck.Comment Archive", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "\u201cProve that people want to remix curriculum.\u201d", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@LauraHilliger/prove-that-people-want-to-remix-curriculum-827c9c66ffd1?source=search_post", "author_name": "Laura Hilliger", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@LauraHilliger", "publish_date": "2015-11-13", "last_modified_date": "2018-06-09", "readtime": "4.82", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "\u201cProve that people want to remix curriculum.\u201dLaura HilligerFollowNov 13, 2015 \u00b7 5 min readEasier said than done. Back in the day, my amazing colleague Jess Klein made an epic PDF laying out a lesson plan for what was then known as Hackasaurus. People who teach started using it left and right, and when I saw it for the first time I thought \u201cHoly moly that looks like a fun bit of curriculum.\u201d But I didn\u2019t need all of it. I only needed pieces and parts (many of which, BTW, are baked in, remixed and modified within Webmaker Teaching Kits), and so I started to think about the models we use when we make curriculum. The old smelly models that didn\u2019t evolve as technology evolved.A map of all the resources and their connections to an initial Teaching KitI\u2019ve always thought the models and systems could be better, so several years ago I started working on an educational model that centered on the idea that educators ALWAYS remix. I thought that if the model was clear, we could tackle the problems of OERs while making new curriculum to #TeachTheWeb. Fast forward about five years and the OER (open educational resources) movement has become something that is well known within the open and the educational communities. But people are still publishing their resources in ways that make remix hard, and as a result we edunerds tend to remix on the fly.We implemented the model in HTML, creating overview pages that were separate from activities. The idea was to separate all the pieces and parts of curriculum \u2014 the learning objectives, the assessment criteria, the activities, the overviews \u2014 so that any one individual part could be remixed into a new bit of curriculum. We tried to lay this model out using the mechanics of the web to make the modularity and remixability clear, but we began to realize that\u201cNo one remixes the HTML. It\u2019s too high bar.\u201dSo now, I\u2019m trying to figure out how we can collect those on the fly remixes and get educators to understand how important their ideas and feedback is when it comes to learning materials. What works? What doesn\u2019t work? How did someone remix context?I think that Webmaker could become the clearinghouse for Web Literacy OERs, and to do so, I think remixability is key. I still think the model is solid, but we haven\u2019t gotten to a place where remixing curriculum is common place. This post begins to explore WHY.The Problems of OERs1. Open Licenses are Confusing and Attribution is Hard\u201cconfusion over copyright, fair use, and Creative Commons is one of things that makes many educators hesitant about adopting any new resources, licensing be damned.\u201d \u2014 Audrey Watters\u201cOften resources using more open licenses incorporate or refer to media that are made available using a more restrictive license.\u201d (Tel Amiel 2013)In education there is \u201c\u2026still a limited understanding of how to move beyond some of the encumbrances \u2014 specifically with regard to reusing others\u2019 content as well as more complex reuse behaviors that lead to new configurations of existing content\u201d (Petrides et al., 2008, p. 352). (Tel Amiel 2013)Users need to be able to contextualize credit depending on how they\u2019ve used a resource.Is the resource BY someone who used an open license or is the user under Fair Use?Is the resource a light edit of someone else\u2019s?Was the resource based on or inspired by someone else\u2019s?2. Users don\u2019t have time to make the required effort\u201cFaculty consistently listed the time and effort to find and evaluate open educational resources as the most important barriers to adoption.\u201d (Open the Curriculum 2014)\u201cExisting educational sites and repositories contribute to this concern. Most are focused on the distribution and dissemination of resources and provided little guidance or tools for those who wish to make revisions or remix existing resources.\u201d (Tel Amiel 2013)Staff (anywhere) rarely have the time to review all the resources submitted. We build software and communities though, so how can automation or, much more importantly, social evaluation make it easy for users to find quality curriculum?3. There are technical barriers to remix\u201cWhen presenting OER development and use, many of the restrictions derived from our working scenario came to the forefront. In many cases, the source guides assumed a reader with substantial access to computer-based resources. \u201c (Tel Amiel 2013)\u201cThe process of remix is usually associated with four steps: finding, relating, creating, and sharing resources\u2026Many of the online portals, which contain more openly licensed resources either do not have alternative language interfaces or metadata, which impacts both finding and sharing resources in these sites.\u201d (Tel Amiel 2013)We have to design mobile-first and keep our need for localization at the forefront. We know this, but we also need to find more ways for lo-fi, no-fi communities to share their offline remixes (e.g. a couple of community managers does not a stable system make).Towards SolutionsCreative Commons licensing table and an early Mozilla Drumbeat project that aimed to make attribution easy.Make licensing and attribution easy, embedded. I\u2019ll leave it to the amazing devs and designers to figure out what exactly that means, but building this into our tools from the onset is a way to encourage remix at all levels (both in learner focused and mentor focused content).\u201cReuse is perhaps reminiscent of the rhetoric around learning objects as they were presented as blocks of media that could be reused and assembled for different contexts, a metaphor that did not hold in practice (Fulantelli et al., 2008; Gunn et al., 2005).\u201dMake remixability & modularity obvious and lean into social evaluation. This is as much about presentation as it is about functionality. We are missing context around our educational model. We\u2019re starting to do that with the Club curriculum, where we are building resources on how to remix as well as giving examples of why and when and how we\u2019ve remixed.Build the thing that makes it easy for others to build their thing (no matter what device they have). As we build features for our communities, continuing to encourage open interaction is essential to changing the landscape of OERs (and open in general). What are the ways in which we can utilize existing systems to encourage remixable curriculum? We\u2019ve thought on this before\u2026Leave me comments and check out the Bibliography:Watters, A.

In October, I took a quick tour of Texas to participate in two national transportation conferences, Railvolution and NACTO\u2019s Designing Cities conference. Here are a few highlights from each:Railvolution (Dallas, TX) This cheekily named conference has its origins in Portland, OR and has traditionally focused on light rail projects and transit-oriented development. However, in recent years, conference organizers have expanded the focus to \u201cBuilding Livable Communities with Transit,\u201d regardless of mode. The conference program reflected this with a cross-section of sessions and mobile workshops ranging from transit\u2019s role in housing affordability, to food access, and to how agencies are leveraging new partnerships to expand their own networks. In addition, DART, the host agency, showed off its brand-new light rail extension to DFW Airport and its mobile app (which includes fare payment and the ability to hail a rideshare service).Shared-use mobility, which is taking a prominent seat at many transportation and transit conferences nationwide, was a hot topic at Railvolution, too:Shared-use mobility encompasses all means of transportation that facilitate \u201csharing,\u201d such as bikeshare, carshare (peer-to-peer, or Zipcar-traditional), and has been a catch-all for ride-hailing companies such as Lyft and Uber. To learn more, check out the Shared Use Mobility Center.I was also excited to hear some of Remix\u2019s partners share stories of their innovative work. Here\u2019s a snippet from a presentation from Lane Transit District in Eugene, Oregon.We also had the opportunity to share what we\u2019re doing at Remix! Our own Claudia Preciado took the stage at Railvolution\u2019s Pecha Kucha Slam (20 slides, 20 seconds each). We heard some great stories from the presenters, and there was even an incredible transit-themed music video.NACTO Designing Cities (Austin, TX) In a previous life, I worked to promote better street design for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit. The North American City Transportation Officials group is at the forefront of this work. Previous NACTO initiatives include the Urban Bikeway Design Guide and Urban Street Design Guide. While what NACTO does is not always focused on transit directly, its work helps to create an underlying network enabling people to safely access public transportation by foot, bicycle, bikeshare, carsharing, or any other non-single occupancy vehicle modes.This year\u2019s conference program included a surprise: a preview of the Transit Street Design Guide, a best-practice guide for city transportation and public works departments to improve the experience of using transit. It includes principles and design guidance to construct streets on which transit can succeed through schedule reliability and safety.I\u2019m really excited about the guide\u2019s contents, which can can be used by transit agencies to outline capital street improvements critical to support successful transit operations. Here\u2019s NACTO\u2019s Matthew Roe giving a preview:Next, Remix is headed to the California Transit Association Conference in Pasadena, November 18\u201320.

I don\u2019t much. \u201cBMF\u201d is great. Really great. But like Ross\u2019s first big hit, \u201cHustlin\u2019\u201d from 2005, it\u2019s mostly the beat.

Ross sounds just sounds off-pace and swallowed up to me, and-I really don\u2019t know what it is that people are hearing-his lyrics are really never anything to write home about.

So when Kirby reached out to me via email about his latest video \u2014 \u201cThe 4 Steps to Getting an Idea (The Remix Method #1) \u2014 I had to check it out. Here it is:Kirby contends ideas derive from the subconscious mind. However everything we experience in the conscious realms feeds the subconscious. As Kirby puts it, \u201cThe subconscious mind cooks the meal, but the conscious mind buys all the groceries.\u201dIn the video, Kirby talks about four steps:1. Create boundaries.2. Consume everything you can within these boundaries.3. Digest the research.With these three steps, as Kirby puts it, \u201cYou\u2019ve thrown a bunch of ingredients into a pot. By processing these material as much as you\u2019re capable, you\u2019ve started your subconscious mind on generating an idea.\u201d What to do next?4. Drop it. Kirby: \u201cTake a vacation. Go out with family and friends. Take a walk. Clean the house. Do some gardening. After a while, your subconscious mind will complete its work and an idea will pop up.\u201dI can get behind this as one approach to generating ideas. From my own experience, I know how ideas can emerge when I am as far away from thinking about them as possible. For example, when I\u2019m out for a run and my mind hits a kind of blank zone, suddenly \u2014 BING! An idea. Or taking a shower. Staring out the window. Moments when the conscious mind is preoccupied. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had surprising insights like this, too.That said, I also believe that for some writers, myself included, intentional and conscious efforts to brainstorm ideas \u2014 using the magic words \u2018what if,\u2019 playing around with existing story concepts and genre-, gender-, and geo-bending them, and so on \u2014 can result in \u2018new\u2019 story ideas. As Kirby says in his previous video serious, \u201cEverything is a remix.\u201d Why not embrace that and consciously attempt to generate story ideas?That said, Kirby\u2019s latest video is a great take on not only respecting the role of our subconscious mind in the creative process, but also feeding it with stimuli in the expectation it will eventually surprise us with an idea.Here is the combo plate of Kirby\u2019s first four videos in the Everything is a Remix series:For the rest of Kirby\u2019s videos, go here.Where do your ideas come from?

That is a big plus point.The whole interface is a massive improvement over the default too. A lot of thought has gone into creating a lightweight but attractive platform for small, low-power devices. Well done Canonical and all involved in the development effort.If you want to try it out, you just need to download the IMG file from here and write it to a 1GB flash drive. I found that to be simpler on a Windows machine using Win32 Image Writer, though I\u2019d appreciate anyone offering a guide to doing it in Linpus \u2014 the default Acer operating system.Before you do anything else, I\u2019d recommend backing your whole system up.

One such label is the newly established imprint Mo:za\u00efek Music.The Belgium-based label is debuting its vinyl first releases timed for a summer drop \u2014 and they\u2019re not hanging about with MZK001. It\u2019s a weighty plate that features London\u2019s Lyeform, backed by Dutch badman, FKOF fam and allround nice guy TMSV on the remix.Ahead of its release in early June, we had the opportunity to check the Stigma EP (including TMSV\u2019s \u2018Rusty 3 Star\u2019 remix) and put pen to paper\u2026The FKOF Review\u201cLyeform has appeared on our radar a few times recently, with frequent Rinse FM airplay thanks to the Keysound Recordings gang. TMSV, while managing to focus on his legal studies, has continued to set the bar with his up-tempo endeavours as of late. With support from the likes of Om Unit, Danny Scrilla and J:Kenzo, Utrecht\u2019s finest has collaborated with the London-based producer to deliver some hot, hot heat.\u201cLyeform\u2019s Stigma\u2019 is one of those tunes designed for dark, smokey dancefloors in abandoned warehouses. The producer has implemented some bitter samples and thugged-out atmospheres to create a dubstep-infused grime vibe that will drive listeners to and then over the edge. The way his raw kicks, a tough snare and dirty stabs correspond with the bass inside the mix is astounding. He has stepped out of his comfort zone to deliver a true sound system rumbler.\u201d\u201cTMSV\u2019s contribution to Mo:za\u00efek\u2019s debut release kicks the hornet\u2019s nest and then sets fire to it. It\u2019s a fierce rework that contains some truly barbaric basslines, a low-pressure zone and corrosive leads that bring total destruction to the dance. It builds to a sonic boom that results in uncontrollable head-nodding, skanking and an old-school fever. The TSMV remix sticks in the mind, making it an essential contribution to Mo:za\u00efek\u2019s debut release.\u201dMZK001 drops 06/06/2016 Pre-order it from White Peach here.Peace, love and respect.FKOF", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Music", "Grime", "Dubstep"]}, {"title": "El-P Remix of Chin Chin\u2019s \u2018GG And The Boys\u2019", "post_link": "https://shabooty.com/el-p-remix-of-chin-chins-gg-and-the-boys-460f02c6e844?source=search_post", "author_name": "Shabooty \u27bf", "author_link": "https://shabooty.com/@shabooty", "publish_date": "2009-04-24", "last_modified_date": "2016-08-09", "readtime": "0.60", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "El-P Remix of Chin Chin\u2019s \u2018GG And The Boys\u2019Shabooty \u27bfFollowApr 24, 2009 \u00b7 1 min read[audio:http://www.definitivejux.net/mp3/GG_Remix.mp3][DOWNLOAD: El-P Remix of Chin Chin\u2019s \u201cGG And The Boys\u201d]& while you\u2019re at it: Vote For Chin Chin\u2019s \u201cGo There With You\u201d On MTVu\u2019s Freshman Countdown.You have until 12 noon today.

Its goal was to \u201creduce impact to the community to the minimum possible\u201d during the agency shakeup, which brought down the number of lines from 37 to 27 overseen by ATI, says engineer Francisco Klein. Francisco and his team used Remix to assess the conditions of existing service prior to ATI\u2019s conception, consider demographic and costing information for the new routes, and compare the two. In addition, the information provided by Remix was used in PRITA\u2019s Title VI compliance report, justifying the changes from the 2013 routes to 2015 routes.Jane, our isochrone, was particularly useful for Francisco\u2019s work. \u201cWe\u2019ve been using Jane as a comparative tool when seeing how the relocation or elimination of former, existing routes looked,\u201d he says, \u201cWhat would the impact be on the service and the overall community?\u201dViewing Census data in Remix\u2019s layers also helped his team see the social impact \u2014 particularly on senior, youth, and car-free populations \u2014 of the route changes. In Puerto Rico, taking transit is too often stigmatized as an indicator that you don\u2019t have the ability to own a car, Francisco says. As a result, EFGB has focused on creating \u201can efficient and reliable system so that people who need it most use it and can say, \u2018Yeah, this is working very well, and it\u2019s meeting the goal and expectations,\u2019 and that could eventually translate into more people seeing transit as an alternative.\u201dWhile ATI is regulating and controlling the new routes planned for the Metropolitan Area of San Juan, the consultants have used Remix to consider systems in other municipalities of the island. Those local services will ultimately work with the systems and routes ATI proposes at an island-wide level. To foster strong and effective service between ATI and the municipal routes, Francisco focused on population data. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to have a system that would be spending too much money and having very limited ridership, so we made sure that we could reach areas with population concentration\u201d in Aguadilla, on Puerto Rico\u2019s north coast, and several municipalities on the southeastern side.\u201cI think that, we\u2019ve had it since the beginning, and it\u2019s a perfect combination of integrating things into one single platform. So if you were not using Remix, then you\u2019d have to do it manually,\u201d says Francisco. \u201cYou\u2019d have to basically lay out the routes, and then go looking for the different layers in different systems. So having everything integrated right there, it\u2019s just cost-effective, it\u2019s efficient overall.\u201dWhile data on ATI\u2019s revamped bus system has yet to be calculated \u2014 the new lines were only implemented this past summer \u2014 Francisco says that his team \u201crecognize[d] that some of the routes were just too long, and so Remix has been very helpful in assessing that the proposed routes are not as long as they used to be. That way, we think we\u2019re taking one step in the right direction of having a more efficient and reliable system.\u201dMoving forward, EFGB will do ride-check and point-check studies to determine the impact of the new routes. Once the data analysis process has been completed, they plan to continue to use Remix to assess potential route changes based on the collected data.Photo via Flickrcase-study prita puerto-ricoOriginally published at blog.getremix.com on March 7, 2016.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Puerto Rico", "Finance"]}, {"title": "New iPod Shuffle Needs A Remix", "post_link": "https://nyulocal.com/new-ipod-shuffle-needs-a-remix-bfd2f22a8a52?source=search_post", "author_name": "NYU Local", "author_link": "https://nyulocal.com/@nyulocal", "publish_date": "2009-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2016-12-08", "readtime": "1.96", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "New iPod Shuffle Needs A RemixNYU LocalFollowMar 27, 2009 \u00b7 2 min readBy Zane BrzezinskiGreat debaters the download.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/shuffle.png\u201d alt=\u201dshuffle\u201d width=\u201d249\" height=\u201d280\" />[Ed. note: This post was submitted by Zane Brzezinski, our new tech writer in the National section.]On the morning of March 11, Apple unleashed its newest iPod into the wild, a fresh update on the Shuffle. The first thing you\u2019ll notice is that it\u2019s small as hell. Smaller than a double-A battery in fact. But size doesn\u2019t matter (at least that\u2019s what my last girlfriend said), it\u2019s how the thing works. So does the $79 mp3 player deserve to enter the hallowed hall of iPods, or will it fall flat on its face?The first thing you\u2019ll notice about the new Shuffle is that there is only one way to interact with the device itself. On top is a small off/on/shuffle switch. Everything else is controlled by a small remote that sits on the new headphones, much like the earbuds that ship with the iPhone. Although this allows for the sleek-as-hell buttonless design, there are a few obvious problems that come along in tow.If you\u2019re anything like me, you have a discarded pair of white earbuds lying around somewhere in your room. That\u2019s because Apple\u2019s headphones suck. They don\u2019t sound good, they aren\u2019t durable, and they sure as hell aren\u2019t comfortable. The problem with the new Shuffle is that once you tire of the shoddy bass/bleeding inner ears/broken buds (and believe you me, they will break), you have absolutely no way of controlling the Shuffle. Sure, if you plug in another pair of headphones and switch the thing on, music starts to play. But what if you want to go to another song? Too bad. Want to pause? Not happening. Want to turn up the volume? You\u2019re out of luck.And just in case you can deal with headphones, don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to navigate as easily as your traditional iPod. Apple has a chart on their website on how to properly utilize the new earbud remote that\u2019s more confusing than the NYUHome dinosaur. For example, if you want to go to the previous track and you\u2019ve listened to more than six seconds of the current track, it\u2019s no easy matter. You have to click the remote SIX TIMES to go back one song. Sure, that tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap might not sound too bad, but you know how you can do that easier? One tap with any other mp3 device ever made. You know\u2026one with controls?The only real benefit to the device is the Stephen Hawking sound-a-like that tells you what track you are listening to. Except he wouldn\u2019t be necessary if Apple had just gone ahead and put a screen on the thing. It seems to have worked well for every other useful gadget ever.So is the new shuffle worth it? Absolutely not. If you\u2019re in the market for a small iPod, just shell out the extra $70 for a Nano. You\u2019ll get great bonus features like: a screen, controls, and retaining your sanity.Photo courtesy of Flickr user designmilk.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["National", "Technology"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://irelandstechnologyblog.com/nokia-tune-remixed-nokia-tune-dubstep-476f7c1ce75b?source=search_post", "author_name": "Ireland's Technology Blog", "author_link": "https://irelandstechnologyblog.com/@ITB_News", "publish_date": "2011-10-10", "last_modified_date": "2016-12-06", "readtime": "0.15", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Ireland's Technology BlogFollowOct 10, 2011 \u00b7 1 min readNokia Tune Remixed \u2014 #Nokia #Tune #DubstepThis is the winner of Nokia\u2019s competition for a remix of the classic Nokia tune, personally I hate it, the new tune on the N9 is the best by a country mile.(Source: http://www.youtube.com/)", "responses": 0, "tags": ["News", "Mobile", "Nokia", "Tune"]}, {"title": "Devendra Banhart, and Then the Amazing Free Paul Simon Club Remix, Somehow", "post_link": "https://medium.com/the-hairpin/devendra-banhart-and-then-the-amazing-free-paul-simon-club-remix-somehow-92f8a3804cd2?source=search_post", "author_name": "Edith Zimmerman", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@edithzimmerman", "publish_date": "2013-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2016-06-06", "readtime": "0.06", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Devendra Banhart, and Then the Amazing Free Paul Simon Club Remix, SomehowEdith ZimmermanFollowMar 4, 2013 \u00b7 1 min readFlight Facilities are also on Twitter.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Music", "Devendra Banhart", "Flight Facilities"]}, {"title": "Pop-Up Remix during #HipHopEd", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@jgmac1106/pop-up-remix-during-hiphoped-e141df0b30a0?source=search_post", "author_name": "Greg McVerry", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@jgmac1106", "publish_date": "2016-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2018-01-30", "readtime": "1.71", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Pop-Up Remix during #HipHopEdGreg McVerryFollowSep 8, 2016 \u00b7 2 min readIn a recent post on my backstage blog (I use it to describe process or half baked thoughts) I explained my excitement for #HipHopEd in order to gather some song lyrics.

As I saw quotes I made a series of remixes for participants in the chat.In each remix I used a creative commons image from Flickr. Using Alan Levine\u2019s Flickr CC Attribution helper I was able to use a legally licensed image while providing some amazing artists credit. In the train picture I actually remixed two images. It isn\u2019t much of a composition. I was constrained by time as I was trying to make a few memes while also participating in the chat.All I used was the eraser and the opacity tools\u2026Still looks pretty cool. I may keep working on it.I hope others in the #HipHopEd community takes up the call to #teachtheweb. Hip Hop has a long history of digital arts. We need to grow this legacy while getting mroe students of color to code. Do I believe every kid should code. No, but everyone should have the opportunity to explore their identities across the web while mastering skills that can open up opportunities that have been closed off for the first three decades of our online world.Originally published at INTERTEXTrEVOLUTION.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Kanye West With Justin Bieber and Raekwon, \u201cRunaway Love (Remix);\u201d Kanye West With Rick Ross, Jay-Z, Nicki Minaj and Bon Iver, \u201cMonster\u201d", "post_link": "https://medium.com/the-awl/kanye-west-with-justin-bieber-and-raekwon-runaway-love-remix-kanye-west-with-rick-ross-jay-z-3c1ff27a010d?source=search_post", "author_name": "Dave Bry", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@davebry9", "publish_date": "2010-08-31", "last_modified_date": "2017-06-23", "readtime": "0.72", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Kanye West With Justin Bieber and Raekwon, \u201cRunaway Love (Remix);\u201d Kanye West With Rick Ross, Jay-Z, Nicki Minaj and Bon Iver, \u201cMonster\u201dDave BryFollowAug 31, 2010 \u00b7 1 min readThe busy, busy Kanye West took a pretty simple approach to his much-hyped bringing together of teeny-bopper Justin Bieber and the Wu-Tang Clan\u2019s Raekwon: he basically recorded Rae and himself rapping over the grimy finger-snap beat from the 1993\u2019s \u201cWu-Tang Clan Ain\u2019t Nuthing Ta F\u2019 Wit\u201d (funny that, when Rae was so careful to write lyrics appropriate for his 16-year-old co-star), and laid clips of Bieber\u2019s vocal track overtop for the chorus. But in the way that shows how simple is so often best, it sounds pretty great. It definitely has the feel of the mid-\u201990s heyday of hip-hop/R&B; mashups.

I can go rated R, I can go rated PG.

It started a trend \u2014 Hype Williams used a similar, though more photosensitive-epileptic-seizure-inducing, effect in his video for Kanye West\u2019s \u201cAll of the Lights\u201d last month. Now, the new video for a remix of another song from Cee-lo\u2019s Lady Killer album, \u201cBright Lights Bigger City,\u201d puts a new spin on the idea. I think it\u2019s great. And, God, I love that Billie-Jeanie bassline. I\u2019m not sure how much the addition of Wiz Khalifa adds, though, other than the cache that comes from his recent no. 1 single, \u201cBlack and Yellow.\u201d His voice sounds fine, but, man I wish he\u2019d try to do a little more with his words. (\u201cAin\u2019t a Laker, but I\u2019m ballin\u2019\u2026\u201d? Really?)Speaking of Khalifa, a really dumb thing happened a couple weeks ago that involved him but was not his fault. There\u2019s this website called Big Ghost Chronicles. It\u2019s a comedy site, wherein an anonymous blogger writes posts in the voice of the Wu-Tang Clan rapper, Ghostface Killah. It\u2019s very funny and skillfully done but most importantly, and pretty obviously, it\u2019s fake. It\u2019s a joke. And part of the joke is that the mysterious author supposes that Ghostface would not like Wiz Khalifa\u2019s music. The mysterious author, in fact, imagines that Ghost would include Khalifa on his list of \u201cAyo the 10 Softest Niggas In the Game!\u201dUnfortunately, not everyone who has read the the Big Ghost Chronicles site has understood that it\u2019s a fake. As hard it is to believe, the hosts of the Star & Bucwild Morning show on the Philadelphia radio station 100.3 The Beat, did not understand this, and, when Wiz visited the show for an interview, they read him excerpts of the posts about him, attributing the derogatory comments to the real Ghost. Khalifa responded by saying that Ghost \u201cplayed himself.\u201dSee, this is how rap beef starts.Luckily, Ghost took his Twitter feed soon after to clear the air:Ayo i wanna address this bullshit going on, this website called bigghostnahmean is a fake website which i have no affiliation with or did i say anthing negative about any of them artists up on that page, got respect for all the young cats coming up doin they thing. tell the kid Wiz, its all love i respect him as a artist and got no issues wit him at all, Once again the website is fake, its not ya boy!Sheesh!", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Cee Lo", "Ghostface Killah", "Irresponsibility"]}, {"title": "Aten\u00e7\u00e3o DJs, Remixers, Produtores, Videomakers e Animadores!", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@maestrobilly/aten%C3%A7%C3%A3o-djs-remixers-produtores-videomakers-e-animadores-ffbedec550e5?source=search_post", "author_name": "Maestro Billy", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@maestrobilly", "publish_date": "2017-06-02", "last_modified_date": "2017-11-28", "readtime": "0.79", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Aten\u00e7\u00e3o DJs, Remixers, Produtores, Videomakers e Animadores!Maestro BillyFollowJun 2, 2017 \u00b7 1 min read*For the English version click HERERecentemente lancei meu \u00e1lbum autoral e agora ele est\u00e1 100% aberto para remixes e cria\u00e7\u00f5es de v\u00eddeos e anima\u00e7\u00f5es.Primeiro ou\u00e7a o \u00e1lbum inteiro aqui, faixa a faixa:Ou aqui, todo mixado:Gostou de alguma faixa e acredita que vc pode fazer algo legal nela?Complete este formul\u00e1rio aqui embaixo que eu te mando as partes da m\u00fasica escolhida (para remixes) ou a m\u00fasica inteira (para v\u00eddeo/anima\u00e7\u00e3o).M.Billy - Commute - RemixesPlease click the link to complete this form.form.jotformeu.comOs remixes e os v\u00eddeos mais legais ser\u00e3o masterizados e lan\u00e7ados.Todo mundo que for escolhido leva 50% de autoria pelo seu remix (registrado atrav\u00e9s da ABRAMUS).A cada 4 remixes prontos, lan\u00e7o um single em todas as plataformas digitais (Spotify, Deezer, iTunes Music, etc).S\u00f3 n\u00e3o vou colocar pr\u00e1 vender na iTunes Music Store, venda s\u00f3 pelo site da ONErpm.Divirta-se!Tudo de bom,Billy.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Musica", "Remix", "Videos", "Animation", "Collaborative Economy"]}, {"title": "Love \u2014 New Adriano Roveri Remixes", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@maestrobilly/love-new-adriano-roveri-remixes-f69d817d6573?source=search_post", "author_name": "Maestro Billy", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@maestrobilly", "publish_date": "2018-02-01", "last_modified_date": "2018-02-01", "readtime": "1.56", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Love \u2014 New Adriano Roveri RemixesMaestro BillyFollowFeb 1, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readAnd here are two new remixes for my songs.The remixer of the hour is Adriano Roveri, DJ and mega producer.If you want to hear some of his productions, you have HEREWell, this time he created a House version and another Chill for Love, one of the songs from my album Commute.Here are the two versions.Here\u2019s what he told me about the process of creating the two remixes:The \u201cChill\u201d version was supposed to be the \u201cHouse\u201d version.When I heard the original version, and then only the Acapella, made me want to do something Housey with 90\u2019s timbres \u2026 the vocal reminded me of some things of that time.Even though I did not use a lot of ready loops, I started to test some at least have a starting point \u2026 and then it fell into a drum loop that I liked, but that there was nothing of House, and on top of it I came in head the rest to make the Lounge version.The House version I already started with the timbres of the synth \u2026 one of them reminded me of some Houses of 94, 95, and I used another background that reminded me of the Nomad \u2014 I wanna give you devotion.I used snares in the counter-timing, which is quite the face of that Garage House of the early 90's.I thought it was cool to do that as well, due to several things being released today that have this 90s face, like the MK \u2014 17, which was already known at the time by Always.Here\u2019s the Nomad reference \u2014 I wanna give you devotion, in case you don\u2019t remember:And here\u2019s the original song:Enjoyed it?Here in my Spotify profile, there are lot more remixes and new songs.All the best,Billy.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Adriano Roveri", "Chillout", "Dance", "Music", "Remix"]}, {"title": "Diddy ft.

Insomma, proliferano e nessuno ne sente il bisogno. Ma cos\u00ec funziona in Italia. Non si raccontano le storie di cronaca, sui giornali, ma si fa la cronaca a partire dalle storie. Si stabilisce un tema del momento e, anche non riuscendo a trovare notizie che ci abbiano a che fare, se ne prendono altre e le si accorpa. Insomma in un modo o nell\u2019altro \u2018sta pagina la dobbiamo chiudere. Dobbiamo chiudere e chiuderemo.Ovvio che la distanza dalla realt\u00e0 sia direttamente proporzionale all\u2019ignoranza e al disinteresse del tema stesso da parte dei giornalisti. I giovani sono un tema tipico. I giovani non esistono come argomento, per come la pensano i nostri giornalisti, perch\u00e9 non sono esattamente persone. I giovani sono i cuccioli dei vecchi. Cresceranno. Inutile stare a capirli che tanto tra cinque anni sono tutti cambiati. \u00c8 lavoro sprecato. Se ne parla, ma in un altro senso. I giovani sono un tema sociale. Ecco. Sono il probblema dei ggiovani. Loro e quello che li circonda.Ora, \u00e8 partito questo ricettone diabolico fatto, al livello pi\u00f9 alto, di giovani, violenza e tecnologia (due temi di cui i giornalisti dei quotidiani in genere non sanno una mazza, con un bign\u00e9 in mezzo). Cio\u00e8, c\u2019\u00e8 chi ne sa, di quello che ascoltano leggono e fanno i giovani, ma non parla con chi fa il pezzo di cronaca sul bign\u00e9 violento alla crema di aiuto. Nello specifico i giovani sono bulli, violenti, coi pixel in faccia che non li si riconosce neanche. E la tecnologia \u00e8 fatta di videogiochi violenti, cellulari che riprendono cattiverie e violenze, siti internet che pubblicano video, indovinate un po\u2019, immorali e violenti. \u00c8 un inferno, \u2018sto tecnologia. Quasi peggio dei giovani.Capite che siamo davanti a un mostro che potrebbe vivere di vita propria e masticare pagine di cellulosa per mesi, prima di tornare in letargo.\u00c8 normale tutto questo? Io mi ostino a credere di no. Che non sia normale e che negli altri paesi sia diverso. Che le foto della Ventura col suo nuovo fidanzato siano in homepage di Repubblica e non pi\u00f9 solo su Eva Tremila, qualcosa vorr\u00e0 dire. Forse considerano la rete un circo equestre. Forse hanno troppi canali di distribuzione di contenuti e pochi contenuti. Forse hanno perso la direzione e vanno a vista. Boh, una di queste di sicuro. Perch\u00e9 in tutto il panorama dei quotidiani italiani solo Jaime D\u2019Alessandro scrive cose sensate a proposito di videogiochi? Ho l\u2019impressione che a differenza di quello che succedeva qualche tempo fa, quando la nicchia si lamentava ma in effetti per la gran parte della societ\u00e0 Luzzatto Fegiz era pi\u00f9 che sufficiente come tasso di contemporaneit\u00e0 e internazionalit\u00e0 musicale, ora le cose stiano cambiando. E come sempre si vede dagli angoli, dai dettagli. Non da come parlano di finanziaria, ma da come parlano del videogioco Rule of Rose, da come raccontano un rave, un singolo, un sito, il sesso, le canne e i manga. Lo scollamento adesso si vede di pi\u00f9. Naturalmente, come un cane si gratta quando ha il prurito, i lettori e i giornali cambieranno senza pensarci.

Yet even as the words echoed in his eardrum, a fresh box whooshed up beside him. Another sucking sound, another thud of the box smacking into place. Four spidery arms snapping out, deftly pinching and folding each flap down. The container\u2019s eager void waited, ready to receive the merch. Reggie figured the sorter must have started one last cycle before getting the shift change signal.One last pair of conveyors careened in from opposite side, jostling for position as they crowded into the pick point, bellying up to the rail in front of him. Their sub-perfect synchronization suggested some bugs had slipped in with the summer updates. The holiday surge would smoke them out soon enough, however.Reggie tried to stop himself, if only for a second, before muscle memory kicked in. Reflexively, he reached in, left and right hands separately picking up items from each of the bucket brigade\u2019s bins. Take, turn, drop, turn. Every fifteen seconds, eight hours a day, five days a week, for more than six years. Close to three million times in all, he reckoned. The story of that toil was written in his odd physique, which had alternately grown and atrophied to the workstation\u2019s asymmetric layout. He was as much a part of this giant warehouse-sized machine as anything else.\u201cReggie, others are expecting you at the canteen.\u201d Now, the dispatcher\u2019s voice was softer, but infused with a clear touch of passive aggression.He stared through the void ahead. The conveyors had already vanished, off to fetch a new caboodle of goods. He tried not to think about just what they were after. All that just distracted him his daydreams. He preferred to get carried away. The pick point became a tropical beachside bar, the one he\u2019d gone to on vacation last winter. The merch morphed into pi\u00f1a coladas. Pick one up and it gets replaced immediately. Put one down and it\u2019s whisked away.\u201cReggie, will you please proceed to the canteen?\u201d The third time, the voice was downright plaintive. Reggie could hear Derrick standing behind him, mouth-breathing, ready to step up to the pick point. He stepped back and Derrick shoved him aside. The next box whizzed in, and his arms snapped up to meet the next wave of incoming conveyors.Sasa slumped over the table, a pile of person. The long, black, braided pigtails spilled over her blue smock and brown arms. Reggie pushed the drink in front of her.\u201cYou gotta eat something. We don\u2019t have much time,\u201d he said.Reggie leaned toward her, shifting his weight onto the table with his elbows as a fulcrum, positioning the bulk of his equally large frame between the young woman\u2019s hands and the drone parked overhead, flitting between the building rafters.\u201cHere. This will help.\u201d Sasa lifted her head and opened her eyes, a glimmer cutting through the bruise fatigue that that spread across her face. Reggie pressed a small, white pill into the pouch of her folded arms. Sasa perked up, shifted in her seat, and swallowed it into the folds of her smock. Reggie looked left, right, and up as he sat back down.\u201cThanks, querido.\u201d The white sphere disappeared down her throat with a gulp of the shake. \u201cBut it\u2019s no use. I can\u2019t keep up.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cIs it always like this in December?\u201d She looked bad. Worse than they usually did after just a few months. He wondered if she\u2019d manage to stick around. He wanted her to, which surprised him.\u201cThis is the worst it\u2019s ever been,\u201d Reggie lied. \u201cTomorrow night, after the shift. We\u2019re outta here. Ok?\u201dThe dispatcher cut in. \u201cReggie? Sasa? You are now invited to return to service!\u201d\u201cRemember, tomorrow night, at the bus stop,\u201d Reggie said.\u201cAy, papi\u201d, Sasa said, the pill\u2019s sudden punch lifting her out of the seat like a booster rocket.The bobblehead shark perched on Reggie\u2019s pick point wiggled around in his surf shorts as the boxes and conveyors sideled in and out. The tempo of its dance was his best tachometer of the dispatcher\u2019s pacesetting. In December, the shark was always in full swing. Yet he never spilled his frozen plastic margarita.Every holiday surge had its hiccups. The center\u2019s daily volume doubled or even tripled, and people and machines broke without warning. But today something was weird. The dispatcher was putting him through a tune-up.The tune-up was the bosses\u2019 way of breaking in fresh meat. You\u2019d be on the line, working steady and slow, thinking that the place wasn\u2019t as bad as you\u2019d been told and then, imperceptibly, the pace would start to pick up. You\u2019d adjust, thinking the speed-up was one-off increment.Then the dispatcher would start fucking with you. Cycling the speed up and down, sending boxes in fast and slow heats to throw you off. A half-dozen cameras tracking your every move, every exhalation, and every uttered swear for signs of stress, frustration, and fatigue, the dispatcher would work you like this for an hour or two until finding the top speed that didn\u2019t wear you out before your shift ended. Pickers produced best when run at a constant rpm, so to speak. Hence, the \u201ctune-up\u201d.Occasionally, the dispatcher would pick a vet off the line for a tune-up, too. Reggie couldn\u2019t remember his last time, but he knew it had been at least a year. At least since his vacation.He groaned as the tune-up kicked in. But after watching hundreds of recruits go through the same, he knew all the dispatcher\u2019s tricks. Drag a foot here, fumble a pickup. But always at random intervals and never in the same place twice. Trick it into backing off early and you could lock in a nice five or even ten percent margin for months. Reggie thought of it like the old mountaineer\u2019s step \u2014 locking your knee to let your skeleton take the load off your muscles for a moment at the end of each step.The tune-up settled in at 23 seconds per cycle, well below Reggie best pace. \u201cEasy peasy\u201d, he thought.The shark smiled a goofy grin at Reggie as he played his cat-and-mouse game with the dispatcher. He was daydreaming again, imagining himself on the beach, sitting next to the shark, toasting each other with their ice cold drinks.\u201cToo easy.\u201d The dispatcher had barely put up a fight.Sasa\u2019s hot, sobbing body slumped against his. The air was muggy, and the bus would be at least a few more minutes. Reggie took one more look around, wondering if it would be his last. The chain-link perimeter fence stretched across the marsh. He could see drones rising and falling there in nighttime summer heat, their beacons blinking like fireflies. Beyond the fence, the old port, where much like the machines inside, the longshoremen used to break down holds filled with crates and barrels by hand. He watched as the trucks \u2014 land ships four and five trailers long \u2014 streamed in and out of the gate.\u201cI fell down again, Reg. And every time I tried to get up, one of them knocked me down again. They didn\u2019t give me an inch. They just kept coming.\u201d Sasa pulled her sleeve up, showing him a series of lateral bruises on her lower and upper arms, about 2 inches wide. The width of a conveyors\u2019 wheels.Reggie rubbed her arm gently. This time he was really going to do it. The bus, nestled in the long line of trucks, finally pulled out and over to the curb.Just then, the dispatcher cut in. \u201cReggie, where are you headed? You still have two hours left on your shift. Don\u2019t forget about your holiday bonus, which will be credited on January 1.\u201dReggie hesitated. Sasa, standing on the first step of the bus, turned to look at him.\u201cI\u2019m prepared to offer you another 10 percent, like last time, provided you meet your retention target again,\u201d the dispatcher said, too cheerily this late in the game.Reggie reached into his pocket, fumbled, and extended his hand, palm up towards Sasa. Another pill, its smooth surface gleaming under the intense LED that flooded the street.\u201cLet\u2019s just stick it out. After we get the money, then we\u2019ll go.\u201dDisappointment, and deep resignation, spread across Sasa\u2019s face. She stepped off the bus, plucked the pill from his hand and stuffed it under her tongue.\u201cPromise me\u201d, she commanded him, turning back towards the warehouse door before he could even respond.Reggie was digging the new pace. Just as he started spacing out again, the dispatcher\u2019s voice cut in, so loud that he dropped a pack of alkaline batteries short of its mark. The package skittered across the polished concrete floor. A demerit flashed on the work log display in front of him. Instantly, it was refunded without explanation.\u201cReggie! Don your beacon and deploy to Aisle 7, Bay 13, stat,\u201d the dispatcher instructed, clearly distressed. Reggie grabbed his vest from a locker, slipped into it, and tightened the straps to center the beacon on his chest. He took a deep breath and stepped through the open gate onto the floor.All he had to do, he told himself, was keep his eyes closed. Aisle 7 was about 150 meters away. He walked briskly, as the conveyors rumbled around him, a puff of air blowing by with each close encounter. Eyes closed, arms in. He repeated it over and over. The first time he\u2019d been out here, he\u2019d made the classic newb mistake, and opened them for a moment. He\u2019d nearly pissed his pants.\u201cReggie, please expedite my previous request. Aisle 7, Bay 13.\u201dAs he came around the corner, and entered the eddy of calm formed behind a protective cordon of parked droids, he knew something was wrong. He felt his heart pounding beneath the beacon. In the center of the semi-circle, lying prone on the floor, Sass looked up at him, gasping for air.Reggie stood there for a long moment, without further instructions from the dispatcher, unsure what to do next.So he closed his eyes again.The supervisor reviewed the footage slowly at first, then faster, looping back and forth to isolate the two pickers\u2019 facial expressions and body movements.\u201cDid the male comply with your instructions?\u201d the supervisor queried.\u201cYes, but he hesitated when he saw that the female was expired.\u201d\u201cStill, his numbers are optimal,\u201d the supervisor noted. The supervisor froze the frame and rewound, scanning the scene. Sasa lay on the floor, a phalanx of parked conveyors forming a cordon around her lifeless body. Reggie was still, even as the supervisor wound the reel forwards and back, the conveyor swarms blinked past. The dispatcher\u2019s unavailability window. Then the message log began to flicker again at the bottom of the screen, and the freeze-frame Reggie sprang to life again, loading the corpse onto a sled in stop-animation motion.Just then, a new thread popped up, already full of red tickets. A fire at Woburn center.\u201cRelease this thread immediately\u201d, the supervisor barked.The dispatcher was alone again. Before turning full attention back to the floor, it made a brief log entry. \u201cFemale, expired, cause unknown.\u201dReggie punched in and took up his place at the pick point.\u201cReggie, congratulations again! Your bonus will be credited at the end of this shift,\u201d the dispatcher purred. \u201cAnd for the New Year\u2019s Holiday, we are running at half-speed tonight.\u201d The shark swung its hips to the floor\u2019s new downtempo new beat.\u201cAnd there\u2019s one more thing. Please welcome Alison to service!\u201d, the dispatcher said. The newb, in her early 20s, walked sheepishly through the canteen door.Reggie glanced across and smiled at her. She smiled back, just like all the others.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Fiction", "Amazon", "AI"]}, {"title": "\u201cEverything is a Remix\u201d \u2014 Part 2 (Movies)", "post_link": "https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/everything-is-a-remix-part-2-movies-791c54d3e620?source=search_post", "author_name": "Scott Myers", "author_link": "https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/@scottdistillery", "publish_date": "2011-02-03", "last_modified_date": "2016-11-08", "readtime": "1.05", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "\u201cEverything is a Remix\u201d \u2014 Part 2 (Movies)Scott MyersFollowFeb 3, 2011 \u00b7 2 min readSo last August, I posted this:This is absolutely worth watching, not only for music lovers, but also per Hollywood\u2019s long history of recycling plots and its current obsession with remakes, sequels, and taking pre-branded brands (e.g., Battleship, Sherlock Holmes) and making \u2018new\u2019 entertainment.Everything has been done before.

We spent a full day with 18 planners from across the state. The daylong workshop served as a venue to connect face-to-face with colleagues, receive hands-on training, and offer a dedicated time to cross-pollinate.Morning Kickoff at DART HQWe believe one of the more valuable things we do is foster connections amongst our customers. We find that transit agencies often face similar challenges and when connected, find creative ways to overcome common planning problems. Here are a few takeaways and best practices shared throughout the day:Communicating data with ease \u2014 conversations involving data can be complexData is often difficult to communicate across multiple parties. Here are a few ideas that have proven to be successful in Texas:Establishing a strong public engagement strategy before kicking off a series of meetings is a great way to get stakeholder alignment earlier in the process. Set up a time to discuss the best methods for communicating data-driven decisions to your audience. Reflect on what has (or has not) worked out well in the past.Be intentional about how you communicate bus service. Consider using colors to represent different types of service: 1) Frequency: 0\u201320 mins = green, 21\u201340 = yellow, 41\u201360 mins orange or 2) Types of Service: local = blue, regional = green, limited/commuter = purpleLearning more about tradeoffs has a high value when making difficult decisions. Walking through a values exercise can help with getting an agreement by understanding tradeoffs (i.e. would you rather have a shorter distance to travel to a stop for more riders for slower service or have 97% of customers within an eight min walk of the higher frequency service).Cap Metro\u2019 s Remap project exhibits great examples of communicating data with ease. Click here to learn more.Bus stops \u2014 is there a magic numberAgencies at the workshop presented a wide range of ideas when it came to the topic of bus stops. Some agencies are adding bus stops for the first time ever and others are considering stop consolidations. The main conclusions were:Different types of service and differing land use require different specifications for stop placement and need. Consider investing the time to understand spacing standards in your service area and don\u2019t be afraid to revisit and redefine as needed.Engage with your riders and gather an understanding that represents a large group of riders. Have you ever thought about holding a public meeting on the bus? What a great way to physically meet riders where they are.Pro tip: Did you know the Remix Line Attributes export offers additional information about stop distance/spacing along a line?Mobility as a Service (MaaS) \u2014 how have Texas agencies embraced changeWe can all agree that a lot of innovation has been brought to the transportation/mobility space in the past 10 years. MaaS has been a buzzword at nearly every conference we\u2019ve attended in the last year and DART is leading the way in Texas. Whether its implementing demand response zones or partnering with TNCs, the GoPass program is a great example of embracing the spirit of MaaS.

Whether it\u2019s taking big leaps to pave the future of MaaS or mastering the art and science of communicating with data, transit agencies in the state of Texas are hard at work.Let your Customer Success Manager know if you are interested in learning more about the Remix Regional Workshop series or where we might be stopping next.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Transportation"]}, {"title": "Come Hear Us! \u2014 ReMIX 2007 in Boston", "post_link": "https://edsquared.com/come-hear-us-remix-2007-in-boston-7077edd4af4f?source=search_post", "author_name": "Ed Blankenship", "author_link": "https://edsquared.com/@edblankenship", "publish_date": "2007-09-10", "last_modified_date": "2017-04-26", "readtime": "1.89", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Come Hear Us! \u2014 ReMIX 2007 in BostonEd BlankenshipFollowSep 10, 2007 \u00b7 2 min readGrant Hinkson (our Director of Visual Design at Infragistics) and I will be doing our talk \u201cMeeting in the Middle \u2014 Designer/Developer Interaction in WPF.\u201d It looks like we have the first breakout session on Tuesday, October 9 at 9:00 AM.

Elements of Creativity is about.. well\u2026 creativity.It\u2019s all been done before. And yet, it\u2019s all somehow different. That is the dichotomy we, as writers, face when attempting to be creative. There\u2019s magical formula how to do it right, but there is a premium put on immersing yourself in whatever medium and genre in which you hope to excel, both to know what\u2019s been done before and how it\u2019s been done.Comment Archive", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Daily Exorcise \u2014 Part 1 (The HipHop Remix)", "post_link": "https://medium.com/whatay/daily-exorcise-part-1-the-hiphop-remix-420f38ea0acb?source=search_post", "author_name": "Sidin Sunny Vadukut", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@sidin", "publish_date": "2006-10-24", "last_modified_date": "2017-11-14", "readtime": "4.32", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Daily Exorcise \u2014 Part 1 (The HipHop Remix)Sidin Sunny VadukutFollowOct 24, 2006 \u00b7 5 min readHey hey hey. Forgotten me already have you? Thought I was gone for good? You are very, very wrong but then I won\u2019t blame you. Its not your fault really. How were you to know that I have been terribly busy with things of a rather personal nature. Of course I will share it with you, no secrets between reader and author on this blog, but not right now. The time is not right. Patience I tell you. All in good time.But what I CAN tell you is that I have joined a gym. A proper one with treadmills and exercycles and dumbbells and spindly things with weights and handles and steel and chrome and all. Yes I have joined a gym all over again.Sigh.Avid readers of this blog, yes all three of you, will know that Sidin Sunny Vadukut has always been most robust when it comes to matters of the waist. He has always enjoyed a good meal of tandoori chicken, rotis, dal makhani and custard followed by a soup and main course and has often been described, in friends circles, as \u2018cuddly\u2019, \u2018well-fed\u2019 and \u2018cute in a healthy sort of way\u2019. If anyone looked at me and quipped that the pounds were gathering around me in little jiggly ripples of cheer I would merely, and coolly, shrug them off the first time and then roundhouse kick them in the face the second. (Well not as much roundhouse kick as smother them between my elbows. I can\u2019t actually lift my leg that high.)It was not a bad life really. With the right wardrobe of loose Fabindia kurtas and open-minded draw-string pants I was managing to maintain my self esteem nicely. (Yes there was that incident in that Air Deccan flight. But I ensure you I did not mean to get stuck like that and delay the onward sector by two hours.) Nothing to complain really. And yes pass me that Dal Makhani please. And a nan please. With BUTTER!But of late, because of this personal thing I was referring to earlier, I had to wear a lot more of those stodgy inflexible formal pants. So off I went and bought myself a few pairs of regulation navy blue and dark brown formal pants that no self-respecting man\u2019s wardrobe is complete without. (Unless you are Bappi Lahiri perhaps. But I doubt even he respects himself. Awwa awwa it seems!)Then two weeks ago I suddenly noticed that something strange had happened to my pants. My feet went in alright and the shins and knees managed to enter without incident. Things began to get a little \u2018testy\u2019 higher up. By the time the fabric had been pulled up to my waist things were looking very very bad.When I mean \u2018tight\u2019 I don\u2019t mean hold your breath in and slip in the button\u2019 tight. Oh ho ho no. I mean \u2018scream in agony, get at least one hernia and pass out\u2019 tight. I immediately did what a man had to do. Especially if he wanted to stay one. I ripped off the worsted wool, settled into a lungi and let out a sigh of relief among other things.Except for one pair of jeans, which I could fit into by getting my roomies to hold the pair up open while I jumped feet first into the cavity from the dining table, the rest of my legwear lay crumpled around my bedroom laughing at me mockingly. Nothing irks like a deprecating length of corduroy.(Enter hip-hop type loop here. Rap following lines\u2026)Things were getting out of hand.And my waistband.I was forced to understand.No more room to expand.No more the gourmand.Between long term health and death unplanned\u2026this, mofo, was the final stand.(End loop. Wait for women to get off you and applause to die. Continue.)The very next day, after a pizza lunch, I ran to the gym next to my place here in Wadala. I stepped in with a heavy heart, a heavier wallet but with considerable determination.If you are one of those people who like economics a lot you will note, in addition to the fact that you have very few friends, how several economic theories are based on human beings being\u2018rational\u2019. This means that they make logical decisions, are predictable and that he or she is a ratio or quotient of two integers, usually written as the vulgar fraction a/b, where b is not zero.Well then, step into any gym, go stand next to the billing area and you will see why the above reasoning is absofreakinglutely wrong. A gym membership is to disposable income what a blackhole is to light, a Vadukut is to spicy fish curry and a Bush is to crude producing nations without democracy. These memberships grab impressionable young men and women in their evil sweaty tentacles and suck them dry till the victim is left with no personal wealth except small change and Sodexho passes in awkward denominations. (When this happens you can only either have Idlis or Murgh Mussallam and nothing in between. It sucks.)Yet, in spite of the inevitable financial challenge, everyday thousands of young men weighing millions of kilos fork out hajjar for gym memberships. And they do this with rosy visions of high impact cardio programs, macho free weights routines, six-pack abs and, most importantly, for a decent shot at the hot dietician who comes in once a week.But for a person like me, with the aerodynamic quality of a teakwood sofa-cum-bed, the gym, alas, is the last resort. I just had to regain the perfect posture and endless stamina that had abandoned me, after years of neglect, sometime in kindergarten.So there I was. Melancholy yet intense. Sitting in a chair while I waited for the gym manager to initiate me into my gym routine. He was going to measure every measurable dimension of my body and then weigh me. After this I was supposed to get up, step over all the tiny pieces of my self-esteem that lay scattered across the floor, and go meet the dietician who would go over my readings and give me a review.Her eyes ran over the tiny ballpoint pen measurements while I looked at the weighing scale sitting ominously in a corner smirking.Is Sidin\u2019s weight loss too big to solve? Will he ever be able to regain his self confidence and esteem? Will he ever be able to fit into his flat-fronted corduroys again? Will the dietician see the sensitive human being inside the cellulite? Is she single? Will Sidin ever write part two of a two-part blog?All that much more in Daily Exorcise \u2014 Part 2\u2026 Coming soon\u2026", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Big Kahuna"]}, {"title": "Noreaga ft.

Myths that creativity comes via inspiration. That original creations break the mold, that they\u2019re the products of geniuses, and appear as quickly as electricity can heat a filament. But creativity isn\u2019t magic: it happens by applying ordinary tools of thought to existing materials.And the soil from which we grow our creations is something we scorn and misunderstand, even though it gives us so much\u2026 and that\u2019s copying. Put simply, copying is how we learn. We can\u2019t introduce anything new until we\u2019re fluent in the language of our domain, and we do that through emulation.For instance, all artists spend their formative years producing derivative work.Bob Dylan\u2019s first album contained eleven cover songs.Richard Pryor began his stand-up career doing a not-very-good imitation of Bill Cosby.And Hunter S. Thompson re-typed The Great Gatsby just to get the feel of writing a great novel.Nobody starts out original. We need copying to build a foundation of knowledge and understanding. And after that\u2026 things can get interesting.After we\u2019ve grounded ourselves in the fundamentals through copying, it\u2019s then possible to create something new through transformation. Taking an idea and creating variations. This is time-consuming tinkering but it can eventually produce a breakthrough.James Watt created a major improvement to the steam engine because he was assigned to repair a Thomas Newcomen steam engine. He then spent twelve years developing his version.Christopher Latham Sholes\u2019 modeled his typewriter keyboard on a piano. This design slowly evolved over five years into the QWERTY layout we still use today.And Thomas Edison didn\u2019t invent the light bulb \u2014 his first patent was \u201cImprovement in Electric Lamps\u201c \u2014 but he did produce the first commercially viable bulb\u2026 after trying 6,000 different materials for the filament.These are all major advances, but they\u2019re not original ideas so much as tipping points in a continuous line of invention by many different people.But the most dramatic results can happen when ideas are combined. By connecting ideas together creative leaps can be made, producing some of history\u2019s biggest breakthroughs.Johannes Gutenberg\u2019s printing press was invented around 1440, but almost all its components had been around for centuries.Henry Ford and The Ford Motor Company didn\u2019t invent the assembly line, interchangeable parts or even the automobile itself. But they combined all these elements in 1908 to produce the the first mass market car, the Model T.And the Internet slowly grew over several decades as networks and protocols merged. It finally hit critical mass in 1991 when Tim Berners-Lee added the World Wide Web.These are the basic elements of creativity: copy, transform, and combine. And the perfect illustration of all these at work is the story of the devices we\u2019re using right now. So let\u2019s travel back to the dawn of the personal computer revolution and look at the company that started it all\u2026 Xerox.Xerox invented the modern personal computer in the early seventies. The Alto was a mouse-driven system with a graphical user interface. Bear in mind that a popular personal computer of this era was operated with switches, and if you flipped them in the right order, you got to see blinking lights.The Alto was way ahead of its time. Eventually Apple got a load of the Alto, and later released not one but two computers with graphical interfaces, the Lisa and its more successful follow-up, The Macintosh.The Alto was never a commercial product, but Xerox did release a system based on it in 1981, the Star 8010, two years before The Lisa, three years before the Mac. It was the Star and the Alto that served as the foundation for the Macintosh.The Xerox Star used a desktop metaphor with icons for documents and folders. It had a pointer, scroll bars, and pop-up menus. These were huge innovations and the Mac copied every one of them. But it was the first combination it incorporated that set the Mac on a path towards long-term success.Apple aimed to merge the computer with the household appliance. The Mac was to be a simple device like a TV or a stereo. This was unlike the Star, which was intended for professional use, and vastly different from the cumbersome command-based systems that dominated the era. The Mac was for the home and this produced a cascade of transformations.Firstly, Apple removed one of the buttons on the mouse to make its novel pointing device less confusing. Then they added the double-click for opening files. The Star used a separate key to open files. The Mac also let you drag icons around and move and resize windows. The Star didn\u2019t have drag-and-drop \u2014 you moved and copied files by selecting an icon, pressing a key, then clicking a location. And you resized windows with a menu.The Star and the Alto both featured pop-up menus, but because the location of these would move around the screen, the user had to continually re-orient. The Mac introduced the menu bar, which stayed in the same place no matter what you were doing. And the Mac added the trash can to make deleting files more intuitive and less nerve-wracking.And lastly, through compromise and clever engineering Apple managed to pare down the Mac\u2019s price to $2,500. Still pretty expensive but much cheaper than the $10,000 Lisa or the $17,000 Star.But what started it all was the graphical interface merged with the idea of the computer as household appliance. The Mac is a demonstration of the explosive potential of combinations. The Star and the Alto, on the other hand, are the products of years of elite research and development. They\u2019re a testament to the slow power of transformation. But of course they too contain the work of others. The Alto and the Star are evolutionary branches that lead back to the NLS System, which introduced windows and the mouse, to Sketchpad, the first interactive drawing application, and even back to the Memex, a concept resembling the modern PC decades before it was possible.The interdependence of our creativity has been obscured by powerful cultural ideas, but technology is now exposing this connectedness. We\u2019re struggling legally, ethically and artistically to deal with these implications \u2014 and that\u2019s our final episode, Part 4.What if Xerox never decided to pursue the graphical interface? Or Thomas Edison found a different trade? What if Tim Berners-Lee never got the funding to develop the World Wide Web? Would our world be different? Would we be further behind?History seems to tell us things wouldn\u2019t be so different. Whenever there\u2019s a major breakthrough, there\u2019s usually others on the same path. Maybe a bit behind, maybe not behind at all.Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz both invented calculus around 1684.The theory of evolution was proposed by Darwin, of course, but Alfred Russel Wallace had pretty much the same idea at pretty much the same time.And Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Gray filed patents for the telephone on the same day.We call this multiple discovery \u2014 the same innovation emerging from different places. Science and invention is riddled with it, but it can also happen in the arts.In film, for instance, we had three Coco Chanel movies released within nine months of each other.Around 1999 we had a quartet of sci-fi movies about artificial reality.Even Charlie Kaufman\u2019s unusually original, Synecdoche, New York, bears an uncanny resemblance to Tom McCarthy\u2019s novel, Remainder. They\u2019re both the stories of men who suddenly become wealthy and start recreating moments of their lives, even going so far as to recreate the recreations.And actually, this \u2014 the video you\u2019re watching \u2014 was written just before the New Yorker published a Malcolm Gladwell story about Apple, Xerox and the nature of innovation.We\u2019re all building with the same materials. And sometimes by coincidence we get similar results, but sometimes innovations just seem inevitable.Everything is a remix = similar but different.Comment Archive", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Top tips for deciphering Remix Agreements", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@shesaid.so/top-tips-for-deciphering-remix-agreements-29edd93fca95?source=search_post", "author_name": "shesaid.so", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@shesaid.so", "publish_date": "2019-09-06", "last_modified_date": "2019-09-06", "readtime": "3.34", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Top tips for deciphering Remix AgreementsAn insight in to fee structures, publishing splits, contracts and more.shesaid.soFollowSep 6 \u00b7 4 min readRecently, a friend of a friend reached out for some advice regarding one of her recordings. She had been approached by a mid-level remixer who had enjoyed some success having remixed a major label owned track.The remixer was enquiring about a fee and a share of publishing, but she had no idea what was considered reasonable for remixes.This short piece sets out some of the basics to consider, whether you\u2019re a remixer or an artist wanting to get your tracks remixed.(This is a very basic summary of the rights involved in remixes and common terms you might expect to see in a remix agreement. This article does not offer formal legal advice and should not be construed as legal advice.)What is a Remix?Put simply, remixing is the process of taking an existing recording and creating a new recording from the stems.A remix is not a cover (i.e. where a new recording is made of an existing song) because it uses audio elements from an existing recording. Therefore, remixes involve both the master rights (the recording) and the publishing rights (the composition or song embodied on such recording). A remix is also different from a sample (where a new recording is made using parts from an existing recording) although the line between a remix and a sample is ever changing and much debated.In order for a remix to be released, sold, licensed and made available, approval must be granted by the master rightsowner and the writer (or publisher).How does the Remixer get Paid?Commonly, remixers are paid a \u201cbuy-out\u201d fee (i.e. on a \u201cwork for hire\u201d basis). The fee is usually paid on delivery of the remix. This means the remixer will relinquish all rights to the remix to the original master owner. The fee can range from \u00a31-\u00a33,000 + depending on the remixer\u2019s bargaining power and standing.If a remixer has remixed a recording without the master owner\u2019s approval (and later approaches the artist for approval), the remixer is unlikely to be in a position to negotiate a fee. Conversely, if the artist or the artist\u2019s label has commissioned the remix, a decent fee may be payable.Another method of compensation is agreeing a \u2018swap\u2019. Swaps are becoming increasingly popular, not only for remixes but for featured artists and producers. Essentially this means that the remixer agrees to remix the artist\u2019s track and in exchange the artist will feature on one of the remixer\u2019s tracks later down the line. This can be a good way of not parting with any actual money.Remixers very rarely receive a share of the money on an on-going basis (i.e. a royalty). On the odd occasion a top remixer may be able to negotiate 0.5\u20131%.What about Publishing?Usually, a remixer will not receive a share of the publishing as they are deemed, in most cases, not to have added any new copyright to the composition. However, remixers with a lot of clout may be able to negotiate a few percentage points of publishing.Common Terms Found in a Remix Agreement1. DefinitionsIt is important to set out clearly the title of the original master, the artist, the agreed remix title and the remixer.2. TerritoryThis is likely to be the world unless the original master is owned or licensed in specific territories only.3. EngagementThis should set out that the remixer is being engaged to provide their remixing skills to the best of their skill and ability and the delivery requirements.4. Recording CostsThe recording costs of remixes are usually borne by the remixer (unless the remixer has been commissioned to do the remixer by the label, in which case the label will pay in accordance with the artist\u2019s agreement).5. RightsThe original master owner will usually own the copyright in the remix.6. WarrantiesThe remixer should warrant that they have not included any recording samples or compositions which could infringe the rights of a third party.Unauthorised RemixesAlthough there are thousands of unauthorised remixes out there, it is always advisable to approach the master owner and writer/publisher for clearance prior to releasing a remix.Remixing existing tracks can be a really good way of getting your name out there as a budding producer and there have even been occasions where unauthorised remixes have become so popular that the rightsholders have cleared the remix and gone on to sell well, but this is not always the case.Thank you so much to our contributing writer for sharing her insights and experience.shesaid.so", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Remix", "Contracts", "Music Publishing", "Shesaidso", "Music Industry"]}, {"title": "", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@DVNC112/i-like-using-sound-interference-patterns-in-the-resonance-remix-style-ive-been-working-on-and-1b694ce83966?source=search_post", "author_name": "Daniel Reagan Diggins", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@DVNC112", "publish_date": "2018-09-22", "last_modified_date": "2018-09-22", "readtime": "0.51", "claps": 0, "voters": 0, "content": "Ask Ethan: If Light Contracts And Expands With Space, How Do We Detect Gravitational Waves?1.3K8Ethan SiegelDaniel Reagan DigginsFollowSep 22, 2018 \u00b7 1 min readI like using sound interference patterns in the resonance remix style I\u2019ve been working on, and suspect that complex human interactions and collective efforts could be better modeled using them in bounded-rationality econ experiments.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["Physics", "Reality", "Human Behavior", "Music", "Sound Design"]}, {"title": "Hot Or Not?

Let\u2019s see how\u2026Recently I published this huge, hugely successful Android UI library. It had quite a few moving parts to it. And, quite honestly, a single image could not justify it\u2019s versatility. So what would one normally do? Make multiple images, of course.(:But when the demo app opens, it\u2019d look sad with just one flavor shown.:(But being dynamic is so much more important than just static. The user should have the option to change it\u2019s variables dynamically. For this, one would normally have to create Sliders, Toggle buttons, Color Pickers and all the fun but boring-to-create UI elements. Here comes to the rescue, ma man, ma homie, Remixer.:DGradle Setuphttps://github.com/rakshakhegde/stepper-indicator/blob/master/sample/build.gradle#L27Initializationhttps://github.com/rakshakhegde/stepper-indicator/blob/master/sample/src/main/java/com/rakshakhegde/stepperindicator/sample/MainActivity.java#L44LocalStorage denotes to use SharedPreferences in the device.Int Range \u2014 Sliderhttps://github.com/rakshakhegde/stepper-indicator/blob/master/sample/src/main/java/com/rakshakhegde/stepperindicator/sample/MainActivity.java#L53Remixer generates code based on these annotations (RangeVariableMethod). Any time user changes these values via UI, your functions are called with the appropriate value. And the best part, these values are saved in SharedPreferences so that your UI looks exactly the same even on app restarts. Yay \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89Always remember to use classes BTW. So, Float instead of float. Boolean instead of boolean\u2026 so on.

I would actually build this and submit a pull request but I personally don\u2019t really need this feature. But hey ;)Similarly, Remixer supports more data types. So as you can see, you can use Remixer to make your library/project pop out by giving your users more control over the UI. You could brainstorm and get playful in your app\u2019s prototype stages. Introduce this tool to your team designers and work on it. Demo different variations to your boss. Heck, you could even run A/B tests, get some feedback from your clients even.Remixer is also built for iOS, JavaScript and something called Remote Controller. You can also configure it to Firebase Remote Controller so that you have control over your UI state remotely.

Pepper, go right now and listen. Feel free to skip the original version and head right to the new remix. Also? If you\u2019ve never listened to Sgt. Pepper you can skip this post; it\u2019s probably not for you.In 2006, Beatles producer George Martin and his son Giles Martin released Love, a \u201csoundtrack remix album\u201d that mashed up \u201cthe whole Beatles lifespan\u201d to accompany the Cirque du Soleil show that\u2019s still running at the Mirage in Vegas. Beatles purists may have been aghast, but for a short period of time I couldn\u2019t get enough of it. I blogged about it at the time:I picked up The Beatles Love over the weekend, and on each listen it literally surprises me. Leaving aside for a moment whether this is a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d thing, the record is an object lesson in Jeff Hawkins\u2019 memory-prediction framework as outlined in On Intelligence. Your brain, wired for years to expect one thing, gets something else entirely, triggering the \u201cwhoa\u201d response.Fast forward a decade, and the younger Martin is now responsible for the remixed and remastered Sgt. Pepper. (George Martin died last year at 90.) Timed with the 50th anniversary of its original release, it would be easy to ignore this as yet another attempt to milk the boomer nostalgia for the late 60s. But if you\u2019re at all familiar with the original, listening to the new record with a decent set of headphones is one \u201cwhoa\u201d moment after another.paul and john, with george martin. swiped from beatles.comThe 1967 Sgt. Pepper was mixed down to mono, so this remix isn\u2019t in the category of \u201cyou can finally hear it the way they wanted you to hear it.\u201d Instead, think of it this way: now you can simply, finally, hear it. And it\u2019s mind-blowing. Here\u2019s Chris Morris in Variety:The detail is astonishing. Accorded their own space, Paul McCartney\u2019s bass playing and Ringo Starr\u2019s drumming leap out anew; in particular, Starr\u2019s work on \u201cGood Morning Good Morning,\u201d which at its climax attains almost a free-form quality, reveals his mastery. George Harrison\u2019s ability to speak volumes in a one-chorus solo has never been more apparent (cf. \u201cFixing a Hole\u201d).The record has me reaching for Jeff Hawkins\u2019 On Intelligence again. It\u2019s a book I recommend all the time to people who design and build products; Hawkins was the founder of Palm and Handspring. Here\u2019s a bit from Wikipedia about his memory-prediction framework that, for me, explains what\u2019s happening when I listen to the new Pepper.The central concept of the memory-prediction framework is that bottom-up inputs are matched in a hierarchy of recognition, and evoke a series of top-down expectations encoded as potentiations. These expectations interact with the bottom-up signals to both analyse those inputs and generate predictions of subsequent expected inputs. \u2026 However, when a mismatch between input and memorized/predicted sequences occurs, a more complete representation propagates upwards. This causes alternative \u2018interpretations\u2019 to be activated at higher levels, which in turn generates other predictions at lower levels.(Can we get back to music? Please.)The second half of the reissue \u2014 outtakes from the studio sessions, rehearsals, snippets \u2014 is just as revelatory as the remix. The recordings capture the band in the act, in a radically different way than concert footage does. They\u2019re not performing, they\u2019re working. Here\u2019s Jon Pareles in the Times yesterday:After three years of hectic touring and recording, and of jaw-droppingly rapid development as songwriters amid the tempest, the Beatles decided to get off the road, where they couldn\u2019t hear themselves play, and to focus on making studio albums. They took five months \u2014 an eternity at the time, now barely a pause for a new wardrobe and sponsorship deal \u2014 to record the \u201cSgt. Pepper\u201d album, \u201cStrawberry Fields\u201d and \u201cPenny Lane.\u201d With \u201cRevolver,\u201d they had embraced studio surrealism and partly jettisoned love songs, and for its successor they would have more time to think and tinker. Yet they still worked amazingly fast, harnessing the era\u2019s primitive technology to pack wild ideas onto four-track tape.In 2008 musician Andrew Bird wrote an incredible blog post about what it\u2019s like to be in the studio, where \u201cthe audience has disappeared and you are given the attractive, but dangerous option to control everything.\u201d Great music makes it easy to forget that everything you hear on every record you enjoy is the result of thousands\u2026hundreds of thousands\u2026of individual decisions. The Sgt. Pepper remix/reissue is a glorious way to witness that decision making by artists at the top of their game. Especially if you think you know every note by heart.Go listen.

Also I promised to explain what the above image was all about.It all starts way back when I first fell in love with Mark V Shaney, who I discovered via an article written by Penn Jillette: \u201cI Spent an Interesting Evening Recently with a Grain of Salt\u201d. Mark is, or was I guess, a bot that posted rambling messages to the net.singles UseNet group.He did this by consuming all of the messages posted to net.singles, and using a Markov chain to spit weird messages back out again.Markov chain, Mark V Shaney, see, it kind of makes sense.I\u2019ve toyed with Markov chains before but always had trouble explaining my use of them to other people, so I drew a diagram part of which is at the start of this post.One way I explain is by saying I\u2019ve thrown loads of fairy tales into a system, then say \u201cOnce upon a\u201d and ask you to predict what the next word will be. You\u2019ll probably say \u201ctime\u201d. You\u2019re guessing the next word based on the previous ones and your experience with fairy tales. We then move onto \u201cupon a time\u201d, next word is probably \u201cthere\u201d at which point the sentence may continue with either \u201cwas\u201d or \u201cwere\u201d, as in \u201cOnce upon a time there was a\u2026\u201d or \u201cOnce upon a time there were\u2026\u201d, at this point we\u2019ve got a split and there\u2019s nothing more ahead except forks and probability.Google auto-completing search queries as you type is similar.Anyway, I\u2019ve done a similar thing using the work of Jeff Noon (for reasons I\u2019ll get into in a moment) as the source material, you can see it here: revdancatt.github.com/CAT780-remixing-noon.I\u2019ll take the following output as an example\u2026\u201cThe whole forest had been anesthetised, her temples wired, her senses stimulated, her eyes were not on Eva, not on Eva, not on Eva, not on anybody in that same realm, the land of dreams and nightmares.\u201dThis started with the words \u201cThe whole\u201d from the book Channel SK1N, if we search for those two words we can see that they appear in four different places\u2026\u2026meaning the system has a 25% chance of picking either \u201cteam.\u201d, \u201croom\u201d, \u201cplace\u201d or \u201cforest\u201d. In our case this time it picked \u201cforest\u201d and off the system goes again moving onto \u201cwhole forest\u201d as the next word pair to put back in again. It only appears once followed by \u201chad\u201d, \u201cwhole forest had\u201d which in turn leads to either \u201cthe\u201d or \u201cbeen\u201d.The original sentence from Channel SK1N starting with \u201cThe whole forest\u2026\u201d continues \u201c\u2026had the feel of a stage set, a location, of something she had already seen on film.\u201d quite different to our \u201cThe whole forest had been anesthetised, her temples wired, her senses stimulated\u2026\u201d.The end result is Jeff Noonian but not Jeff Noon, it\u2019s using all the same words that Noon uses and no more, just not in the same order. The chances of it recreating the whole original sentence are slim, 25% to pick \u201chad\u201d, then 50\u201350 of to get \u201cthe\u201d, only 20% for the \u201cfeel\u201d and onwards. Just a 2.5% chance to have matched the first 6 words.As soon as you hit a super connector such as \u201cby the\u201d, \u201cwith a\u201d, \u201con a\u201d and so on then all bets are off.Here\u2019s the resulting image for our phrase\u2026Why Jeff Noon?A couple of reasons, and not very well articulated ones at that. The first is easy, Noon\u2019s books are being re-released as ebooks: metamorphiction.com which makes it particularly easy to get at the source text (ssshhh, don\u2019t tell).The second is a bit more complex and it\u2019s not what I\u2019m claiming Jeff\u2019s work to be, but rather how I think of it. I\u2019m not going to say \u201cJeff\u2019s work is all about\u201d but rather; it seems/feels to me as though a lot of Jeff Noon\u2019s work has parallels to music and remix/dub attitudes. Needle in the Groove is a story that remixes itself as it progresses, a number of books remix the location of the city of Manchester\u2026 or maybe they\u2019re a cover version of Manchester.This comes out again in Cobralingus a fictional writing engine that \u201c\u2026uses the Metamorphiction process to apply the techniques of electronic dance music to the production of words, dissolving languages. In this mutated, liquid state, words are manipulated into new forms; borrowed text is sampled and transformed.\u201dA simple Markov chain almost certainly isn\u2019t that but it is an interesting starting point. Music is steeped in remixes, cover versions, mashups and sampling. But this doesn\u2019t happen in writing (probably for very specific copyright reasons), you don\u2019t often get authors covering or remixing someone else\u2019s story. It happens but very rarely. Where are the 7\", 12\", radio edit, club mix version of writing, held within the same medium of writing?As Automated Alice is the story of Alice from Lewis Carroll\u2019s book set in a future version of Manchester, a Markov chain allow us to throw the two books together and mix between them\u2026\u201c\u2018Oh dear!\u2019 Alice murmurs to herself. \u2018Not only is this snake poisonous,\u2019 replied the Badgerman, \u2018and after all\u2026there aren\u2019t that many\u2026\u2019 that is what she did, she picked her way between Birdcaging girls and Briefcasing boys, \u2018and the real Whippoorwill?\u2019 she cried, \u2018wherever have you flown to?\u2019 And then cubism, because I couldn\u2019t be doing with making calculations?\u201d\u201cYou MUST have meant some mischief, or else you\u2019d have signed your name on a slight breeze. \u2018Whippoorwill!\u2019 cried Alice to the north of the ground. So she began very cautiously: \u2018But I am getting forgetful in my time, but never had fits, my dear\u2019, and she said to Alice, \u2018Give yourself up! Give yourself up!\u2019 Alice forced herself to her full size by this time, that Alice managed to find (frustratingly) that fully twelve pieces were missing from my jigsaw!\u201d\u2026one Alice blending into the other.Or even allow Nola from Channel SK1N to meet Alice from Automated Alice\u2026\u201cWhirrrrr. Moments passing. Clikck whirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.Nola moved over the Dome\u2019s image vanished as she whipped her scaly tail at the bar, flipping open the trapdoor and Alice did tap on the camera\u2019s gaze, on the shelf, according to Chrowdingler, is known as Djinnetic Engineering, on account of her skin, her belly, her hands started to move! Suddenly Alice was curious at hearing this news, and the screen like a white sheet, nothing more. Had she been called, back then? And she slipped and almost fell.Too close. Sweat.Heat. The smell of my adventures!\u2019 Alice observed to herself, \u2018it\u2019s a book beginning in C\u2026 e\u2026 y. Now what could they possibly be called? Wait a minute!\u2019 Just then, a thousand pieces and the sounds of their pursuers dwindled away.\u201dA Markov chain is a blunt tool, but an interesting starting point.Further reading:Origins of a Dub Fiction by Jeff Noon over at Language is a VirusNote: this was 1st published on my own site on 13th March 2013.", "responses": 2, "tags": ["Markov Chains", "Jeff Noon", "Generative Text", "Machine Learning", "Artificial Intelligence"]}, {"title": "Love Remixed, and Other Conversations You Won\u2019t Want to Miss", "post_link": "https://medium.com/anchor/love-remixed-and-other-conversations-you-wont-want-to-miss-43bd57a0ffd8?source=search_post", "author_name": "Anchor", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@anchor", "publish_date": "2016-08-12", "last_modified_date": "2018-03-02", "readtime": "2.81", "claps": 15, "voters": 15, "content": "Love Remixed, and Other Conversations You Won\u2019t Want to MissAnchorFollowAug 12, 2016 \u00b7 3 min readAnchor is the easiest way to record audio and start conversations with people from all around the world.

As he enters his senior year of high school in the fall of 2017, K has already caught the ear of esteemed beatsmiths like Dibia$e, Elaquent, Flying Lotus, and House Shoes by dropping a steady stream of remixes and original production on Bandcamp and Soundcloud. But as much as he appreciates the support given by veteran producers thus far, he still isn\u2019t completely satisfied with the results of his work. \u201cI feel like I can do better than what I put out,\u201d K tells me. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t made it yet.\u201dFor K, the journey from novice bedroom producer to Twitter shoutouts from Flying Lo started in 2012 at a mere 12 years old. \u201cReally, I was bored and I had software on my computer \u2014I had nothing to do,\u201d he says. \u201cI started making beats using loops. Then over time I started to get more into it. I started to delve into my craft.\u201dK\u2019s \u201cwontUkome_\u201d SoundCloud track.Part of delving into his craft involved showing friends his early work to get some honest feedback. When peer reviews came back as mostly positive, he realized that production could be more than just a hobby for him. \u201cWhen people started paying attention to my music, that\u2019s when I got serious,\u201d he says.\u201cEverything I learned, I learned by myself.\u201dMany producers see equipment improvements and upgrades as an important part of their evolution, but K is still using the same basic Mixcraft software he started out with five years ago. Though other programs offer shinier bells and whistles, K appreciates the simplicity and user-friendliness of the Mixcraft interface. \u201cI think the layout is easy to get around. Everything is well mapped out, everything is in plain sight,\u201d says K. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot to it, so it\u2019s not that technical to use compared to Ableton or FL. Mixcraft is basic, but I can do more with less.\u201dUsing a different software than his peers has been instrumental in the evolution of his sound, often steering him away from the temptation of mimicking others. Without endless YouTube tutorials and live streams to watch and learn from, K has mostly blazed his own trail. \u201cEverything I learned, I learned by myself,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I teach myself, I find my own style through leaning myself.\u201dK\u2019s \u201cone thing\u201d flip, with damn near 65,000 plays and counting.Though K values his time spent learning in a vacuum, he isn\u2019t afraid to draw on the work of others when in need of some inspiration. Such was the case when he put together his most successful and well-known song thus far \u2014 a remix of Amerie\u2019s 2005 hit \u201cOne Thing\u201d. \u201cI was chilling, I was making beats in my room,\u201d he tells me while describing the song\u2019s genesis. \u201ceu-iv had a live feed on Instagram so I was tuned in and watching him make beats \u2014 I was inspired. I love his beats.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t drop my passion for my job and I won\u2019t drop my job for passion.\u201dWhen the livestream ended K was further inspired by producer wntr\u2019s flip of Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s \u201cNo, No, No\u201d. He was so taken by the producers re-imagining of the song that he decided to fall asleep while listening to it to get the creative juices flowing. \u201cI played that in my sleep, just to get inspiration. I played it on loop,\u201d he says. \u201cI woke up the next morning and straight away I made a beat.\u201dAn exclusive 30-track SoundCloud playlist of choice K, Le Maestro cuts.Though the drum track came easily, K hit a snag while trying to find the right sample to flip. Then, after taking a break to sift through some ideas on his laptop, he found a potential match. \u201cI loaded it up on the software and I went through the sections of the song,\u201d he says. \u201cThe end bit was crazy. I put it over the drum beat and it was sounding good but it wasn\u2019t right straight away. So I filtered the sample so it\u2019s muffled but you can hear the melody.\u201dAfter adding a bassline using Mixcraft\u2019s live bass VST, K still had to figure out what vocals to sync it with his instrumental. After tracking down a \u201cOne Thing\u201d acapella on YouTube and doing some DIY touch-ups to improve the sound, he had a finished product on his hands. \u201cI put it up and went to bed. From there it took off,\u201d he says.\u201cI played that in my sleep, just to get inspiration. I played it on loop.\u201dIn a matter of month\u2019s K\u2019s ultra-smooth remix has surpassed 50,000 plays on SoundCloud and made its way into Boiler Room DJ sets. The response has been mind-blowing at times, but K still thinks his best work is yet to come. \u201cWhat I think is better than that remix is something that I haven\u2019t made yet,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I can make to top it. But whatever I haven\u2019t made could be the next thing.\u201dK\u2019s NostalGia album on Bandcamp.With the internet helping his music reach listeners all over the world, K is now focused on taking everything one day at a time. \u201cMy focus for the next few years is to get my studies done first,\u201d K says. \u201cBefore I do uni[versity] I\u2019m gonna take a gap year \u2014 hopefully travel and do shows within a gap year and raise some money for university.\u201dIn addition to staying grounded, he doesn\u2019t want to jump the gun and sacrifice a successful academic career and other potential job prospects for the often turbulent world of a musician. \u201cMusic is going well and same with studies, but I\u2019m trying to find balance between the two,\u201d he says matter-of-factly. \u201cI won\u2019t drop my passion for my job and I won\u2019t drop my job for passion.\u201dWherever his path leads him next, music figures to play a major role K\u2019s life for many years to come.\u201cKind of a Weird Fate Thing\u201d: The Untold Story Behind Elaquent\u2019s \u201cShibuya\u201dBefore he dives into any album, Toronto-based producer Elaquent asks himself a few basic questions to guide the\u2026medium.comConnect with K, Le Maestro on Bandcamp, Facebook, Instagram, Soundcloud, and on Twitter @lemaestromind.Want more engaging narrative non-fiction music journalism and curated playlists?

CoinTelegraph even highlights this in a round-up of sorts.A cryptocurrency exchange in Tokyo has halted services after it lost $32m (\u00a325m) in the latest apparent hack on volatile virtual monies. Can we call it that? Virtual monies, it\u2019s a very European way of saying it.It\u2019s usually mostly Bitcoin and yes, it\u2019s quite hackable, let me assure you.The company, based in Tokyo, is called Remixpoint and it runs an exchange called BITPoint. The company also has used car, travel and energy businesses. The company apologized for the hack on Friday (July 12), saying that the losses were confirmed a day before.Digital money is all fine and well, that is, if it were actually secure and not prone to hacks, fraud and theft.You know it\u2019s mainstream news when even Bloomberg (paywall) covers it. Still, $32 million is on the high side.Group-ib c/o CointelegraphAs the reputable site pymnts (who have covered Libra really well btw) reports:The complete picture of the hack and theft is under investigation, and the theft included Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and other well known digital currencies.Two-thirds of the losses affected customers of the exchange, the company said, and the rest belonged to the company. Transactions have been stopped in the meantime. That\u2019s just a gigantic B2C loss in trust right there!Japan, which set up a licensing system to oversee crypto use, has been fairly open to digital currencies from the beginning, even though there have been some newsworthy digital thefts in the past. The traditional banking system in the country has been more skeptical, however.Bitcoin has a stronger presence in Japan and even retails there more than most other countries.As reported elsewhere, Remixpoint said the lost money was in what is called the \u201chot wallet.\u201d Money in the \u201ccold wallet,\u201d which has tighter security, was safe.What\u2019s new in crypto havens (heavens?), the devil(s) of cybersecurity still can hack them. That\u2019s not good for trust in these cryptocurrencies as stores of value, not to mention actual digital currencies.The apparent hack emerged after an error appeared in the firm\u2019s outgoing funds transfer system on the night of July 11th, 2019.According to the odd reporting of The Guardian, this is the latest hack involving cryptocurrencies, which have become synonymous with vast fluctuations in value, being used in criminality and frequent theft through hacks. Very bleak, guys!Bitcoin is also synonymous with the ultra wealthy storing value that will be even more profitable. Yay, to be in the 1% in times like these.Japan is still essentially a trail blazer though.

Conceived in 2004\u20132005 for the Baltimore Sun redesign, it took twelve years to complete the expansions of this initial dozen styles family to this large family presented today. The new Mencken now has sixty-three styles, divided into three widths, three optical sizes, romans, italics, borders and dingbats. Generally, optical size typeface families belong to a same common construction. It falls into the same category of type classification, while presenting different x-heights or contrasts. Mencken is unique because it is designed according to different axis and optical sizes. Firstly, Mencken Text is a low-contrast transitional typeface, designed on an oblique axis, asserting horizontal with featuring open counters. Its capitals follow Didots to better harmonize the rest of the family. On the other side of the spectrum, Mencken Head (and narrow variations) is designed on a vertical axis, high contrast, in a contemporary Didot style.Mencken: Three axis and contrastsMencken: The 63 fontsFrom Baltimore Sun\u2019s project to Typofonderie\u2019s MenckenIt is a bespoke typeface for American newspaper The Baltimore Sun started at the end of 2004 which marks the beginning of this project. The story started with a simple email exchange with Lucie Lacava then in charge of redesigning the American West Coast newspaper. As usual, she was looking for new typeface options in order to distinguish the redesign that she had started. I then got back to her with some quick tests around the idea of \u200b\u200ba Compressed Caslon and Didot, because the daily used a kind of Century ultra-narrow and not very readable. After few weeks of work, the concept of the Mencken emerged little by little: The first variation is very compact but with a low contrast oblique axis, open, ultra-readable and suited to small text settings; a second variation adapted to the intermediate subhead sizes and a last set suited for headlines. It\u2019s a compact design because the challenge was to be able to set more easily narrow columns of the daily for a better type color. Also to remain economical and thus to preserve the necessary space for a clearer structuration of the overall design of the pages. In a rather different design from the text version, the headline version is a kind of Didot strongly inspired by the so particular Ambroise finish on serifs. Of course the result is very different because Mencken is a contemporary large x-height style, featuring slightly triangular drops terminals, specific glyphs like y, in a design suitable for languages \u200b\u200band using lots of y in their words\u2026 The headline version is designed on three widths enabling the daily Baltimore to rhythm the different sections and their specific thematics. For the variants of the family, Tom Grace who just arrived at Typofonderie, helped us with a fast collaborative work early 2005 in order to deliver in a short time.At the time of its implementation, a survey of the newspaper\u2019s readers has revealed that its previous typeface, drawn in the mid-1990s, was unsatisfactory. The Mencken was well received, some reader responses was particularly enjoyable: \u201cIt\u2019s easier to read with the new type even though the type is designed by a French.\u201dMencken in use on the Baltimore Sun.Why it is called Mencken?The name Mencken \u2014 proposed by Monty Cook, Baltimore Sun editor at the time \u2014 is a tribute to H. L. Mencken\u2019s journalistic contributions to The Sun. According to the London Daily Mail, Mencken ventured beyond the typewriter into the world of typography. Because he felt Americans did not recognize irony when they read it, he proposed the creation of a special typeface to be called Ironics, with the text slanting in the opposite direction from italic types, to indicate the author\u2019s humour. Affirming his irreverence, the Mencken typeface does not offer these typographic gadgets.Henry Louis Mencken (1880\u20131956) was an American journalist, satirist, cultural critic and scholar of American English. Known as the \u201cSage of Baltimore\u201d, he is regarded as one of the most influential American writers and prose stylists of the first half of the twentieth century. He commented widely on the social scene, literature, music, prominent politicians and contemporary movements. SourceMencken various stylesThe super-family concept re-investigatedThe Mencken is therefore a typeface answering to different sorts of uses, whose design is different according to its uses: from oblique axis in small size to vertical axis in large sizes. Vertical proportions (x-height, capitals height, etc.) were designed to be compatible with Le Monde series. The difference with Le Monde remains on the Mencken\u2019s small caps, drawn on an intermediate height between the lowercases x-height and capitals, in order to remain present for acronyms or to compose the first line of a paragraph or the words following a drop cap. Lucie Lacava and I followed the idea launched by Matthew Carter few years ago for some of his typefaces intended for publications.The concept of super family is already old, imagined by Jan van Krimpen in the thirties, affirmed by Gerard Unger in the 70s, then by Sumner Stone in the late 90s. With Le Monde started in 1994, I naturally followed this idea which seemed wonderful: bringing tones of particular typographic style while remaining modular and compatible. But quickly I realized that drawing a family following a structurally similar design did not bring the required contrast when set side by side on a single line of text.Mencken: compared to Ardoise, Le Monde Courrier, Le Monde JournalMencken: optical sizes and familyThis desire to simplify the work of art directors, graphic artists in their needs of nuances, contrasts in their typographic system remains an important point. That\u2019s why, when we\u2019ve finalized Ardoise with Mathieu R\u00e9guer around 2010\u20132011, I did everything to make Ardoise compatible with Mencken, while they were structurally different. The goal is to keep some ideal of a super family, its practical aspect without the design\u2019s standardization of the structure that rides out its nuances and stylistic differences. Ardoise therefore perfectly follows the vertical proportions of the Mencken: heights of capitals, tiny, small capitals and figures. But neither the style, nor the shapes\u2019 structure, in order to keep some contrast when set in the same line of text. And as Mencken, Ardoise offers narrow variants for headlines which remains compatibles.Mencken: Boders (extract.) Much more borders and various dingbats available tooDingbats and bordersFor Ambroise in 2001, I took advantage of the different weights and widths in order to create ornaments and borders adapted to each of the family\u2019s weights. Since then, it became a tradition as it is here the case for Mencken which borders are not only tailored to weights but also to contrasts. There are two sets in the Mencken: dingbats suitable for publications together with combinable dashes and lines.Mencken glyphsProduction and publicationImagining, designing, producing, and then marketing a family requires a long-term investment. The Mencken\u2019s extension starts slowly towards 2009. We start from a reduced character set of about 250 glyphs, of four masters for Romans, two masters for italics and also two masters for headlines variants. Over years, the project becomes clearer, and I reach to ten masters, 800 glyphs per masters. With a rounded finish, holding the design in its extensions proved to be tedious, and the various extensions attempts have been repeated several times. By 2014, however, the family foundations were established in a sustainable manner. Then Mathieu R\u00e9guer arrived on the project and took over some finalizations such as the Head Compress masters and final production with me.The optimization of the optical variations started in 2016. Mathieu R\u00e9guer has set up mechanisms in order to change glyph shapes via Superpolator. It should be recalled that in this font family outlines are quite different because of the oblique axis \u2014 vertical axis with rounded-shaped finishes placed in the diagonals, and therefore at the boundaries of the grid of 1000 units of the OpenType PostScript fonts. When interpolating a complex shape, it requires many points such as rounded finishes, the 1000-unit grid positions then the BCPs on the grid and breaks outlines. With Benjamin Blaess, and Mathieu R\u00e9guer we therefore spend lots of time to make interpolation transitions being fluid. Subsequently, it is then the adjustment period for all weights, which according to the widths and contrast must perfectly fit together. Each change in a sixty-three weights family takes a considerable amount of time for production. We did not know in advance that Narrow family\u2019s extrapolation would work. As, beyond design\u2019s space generally established by masters, distortion risks are importants. We arrived there, not without numerous tedious optimisations of our sources.Mencken: A typeface specimen designed by Claudia de AlmeidaLover of all things related to design, Claudia de Almeida left her home in the south of Brazil at age 18 to study design at the School of Visual Arts in New York City. After graduation, she worked for nearly 10 years as an award-winning designer and art director at titles including T:, the New York Times style magazine; The New York Times magazine; Blender; More; New York; Domino special editions; Gourmet special editions; and Men\u2019s Health. In 2013, she headed west to serve as design director at Wired. Inspired by her instructors at SVA, Claudia went on to teach there; and she continues to educate designers-in-training through type classes at California College of the Arts in San Francisco. She is also the education co-chair for the San Francisco chapter of AIGA. In 2014, Claudia launched o Banquinho with the redesign of Real Simple magazine. Now she spends her time working on projects she loves; jetting between San Francisco, New York City, Seattle and anywhere great projects take her. At Typofonderie, we\u2019re thrilled to see how she has designed a powerful, beautiful specimen of Mencken. This specimen will be sent for free to all customers of this typeface family.Mencken in use from Variety to Emmanuel Macron campaignUsagesA typeface is designed for a specific use. Here the daily newspaper of Baltimore\u2019s columns, enables to affirm a style due to the technical and formal constraints defined during the design stage. Obviously, a typeface cannot be confined to a single use linked to its history. The role of the typeface designer is to produce a tool intended for users who know how to respect rules in order to break them and to create new things for new territories. Mencken is used in various dailies, magazines such as Variety since its last redesign by Chris Mihal in 2016. The latest one is use by the art directors Thibault Caizergues and Olivier Alexanian launched since few days ago for the end of presidential campaign of Emmanuel Macron.Like every time, it\u2019s an absolute surprise with uses I could no even imagine during the design process. My only recommendation for the future: Graphic designers, artistic directors, designers, designers, etc. please surprise me!

(But those utilities were improvised before they were repeated, and then improvised again in every dino-bird that rediscovered \u2013 for example \u2013 feathers gather the attention of the other sex.)Again, and earlier: the dazzlingly intricate machinery of nucleated cells and all their busy organelles emerged from tightly interwoven ecosystems of relationships between much simpler micro-organisms that combined like Voltron to dissolve their paradox of conflict and acquire new faculties, a new identity appearing at the interference pattern in between their smaller needs and capabilities.Basically, this is how evolution works.In every case, selection acts on what\u2019s already there.(And often more than once. It is the case that good ideas occur in many places simultaneously \u2014 just like evolutionary theory did, to the surprise of both the men who independently discovered it, the unsung visionary Alfred Russel Wallace and co-author Charles Darwin. It seems increasingly believable that birds evolved flight several times, and living species represent the one surviving line; it seems more more probable with every publication on the origins of life that it could have emerged on early Earth, been wiped out, then emerged again; and even if it spoils our myth, it\u2019s true that many diferent types of fish \u201cattempted\u201d life on land at once, about 400 million years ago when \u201cfish with feet\u201d was \u201cbleeding edge.\u201d It\u2019s like the rude awakening of learning that the next-school-over\u2019s kids all look and dress exactly like your friends and that you\u2019re automatically fulfilling some invisible self-organizing social molecule. As Parahamsa Yogananda said, \u201cEnvironment is stronger than will.\u201d Convergent evolution is the natural outcome of the same ingredients at work within the same environments and forces. We are chemistry, however noble.)Three vertebrates answer the question of aquatic living. For fins, \u201cJust add water.\u201d Art by Victor Leshyk.Most scientists today would differentiate an exaptation from a normal adaptation, like the latter\u2019s a direct \u201cresponse\u201d to the environment, the former the \u201cco-opting\u201d of a trait originally shaped to suit some other situation. This was how Stephen Jay Gould and Elizabeth Vrba originally meant it. This is silliness. Of course the origins of traits won\u2019t necessarily be obvious in those traits\u2019 later functions. But for evolutionary theory to stay true to its own axioms, then none of it\u2019s anticipated, none of it is purposeful, and none of it (until we started screwing with the process) was a conscious and intentional adjustment of an organism to its changing set of circumstances. Everything just happens. Fitness is determined once a thing exists. No evolution by informed consent. The possibilities of novel traits can\u2019t be predicted, only excavated piecemeal once they\u2019re in the world, interacting. Every interaction changes the environment, so every trait exists before, and makes, the world in which its fitness must be tested. Every trait co-opts the pieces of the prior plays and finds new use for them in an environment it cannot help but alter. There is no original or final function; every adaptation is an exaptation. (Daniel Dennett said this first.)That means that we will not find Eden in the past or future. By scattering our psychomorphic bias of \u201cIntelligent Design\u201d into the vastly more believable (because empirically supported) Wood Wide Web and Gaian atmospheric regulation, we bestow decentralized \u201cdesignoid\u201d agency to Earth itself, admitting that it\u2019s smart enough to improvise, if not to plan ahead. (As such, no body planned the head, which we can call, poetically, an afterthought.) Our era is in part defined by this expanding of the definition of \u201cintelligence,\u201d projecting the Anthropocene back into a new past in which life is always acting on itself, there was never \u201cnature\u201d as a thing apart from \u201cculture,\u201d and the notion of a \u201cvirgin forest\u201d is ridiculous. If we learn to see the planet in this way, we lose our dream of privilege and come awake to just how smart and busy everything already is.Left: The World Wide Web. Right: The \u201cWood Wide Web.\u201d (From my presentation, \u201cTech Ethics as Psychedelic Parenting.\u201d.)Being the most intentional participants in evolution doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re the smartest, and it certainly does not set us apart from other life. Language as a means of horizontal information transfer isn\u2019t even new; it reinvents the promiscuity of genes among bacteria, exchange of modular identity among the simplest and least-constrained varieties of life. By keeping DNA within the nucleus, our complex cells lost most of their ability to benefit from \u201cprehistoric p2p\u201d like this. So sex evolved. We had to find a way to shake it up.Which brings us back to exaptation: it\u2019s the law, because recombination is the way to maximize your options in the great entropic game called \u201cmaking use of all available resources.\u201d Life\u2019s modus operandi might be summarized as: \u201cFill All Niches.\u201d This invites a strategy \u2013 call it a meta-adaptation \u2013 favoring what Stanford\u2019s d.school guru David Kelley calls \u201cfail fast.\u201d Try everything as fast as possible. Try sex instead of cloning your genetics endlessly and waiting on the right mutation. Then try language so you can communicate a new experience before your listener has had that same experience. (It\u2019s easier than coming up with and remembering new words for every damn new thing, as Martin Nowak pointed out in his work on the origins of syntax.) \u201cTry Exaptation!\u201d to profoundly multiply the possibilities of creature-multiplied-by-landscape, every combination one of countless parallel solutions to the question of survival.You might even say that evolution only is because the universe would \u201clike\u201d to find a way to dissipate itself as inefficiently as possible.And so it is that exaptation\u2019s everywhere we look. Offering their masters up for remixing, producers let new life into their music, leaving many \u201coffspring\u201d (mixes) more than used to be the case for songs with only one definitive recording. And the catchier the tune, the more alluring it will be to pollinators, gathering attention, leaving strains of melody in memory that then go on to fertilize the ears of someone else.On how flowers and pollinators collaborated to create what we know as \u201cbeauty.\u201d (Watch more of my videos on YouTube..)Ideas, like flowers, we did not invent; we just discovered and remixed them. Almost every major scientific revolution seems to come from someone outside the domain of their discovery\u2019s accepted expertise, a person whose beginner\u2019s eyes can see new meanings in the data. \u201cWhen all you have\u2019s a hammer, everything\u2019s a nail\u201d\u2026until, you learn to see the hammer as an open-ended thing-becoming-process, a protuberance of the original, expanding, and ongoing gesture of the cosmos. Then it is an instrument of Art, an invitation into sacred Mystery, and more.The deepest advertisement ever? (Via.)The lesson here is in approaching puzzles with the fullest understanding of our resources. It\u2019s equally as true in human innovation as it is in the diffuse cognition of the planet: start with what you have. Start from \u201cfacts at hand\u201d \u2013 beginning with the hand that you employ right now, to grip that stable and familiar idea, \u201cthe hand\u201d\u2026perhaps it can be used to get around on new terrain?Every future\u2019s laying all about in parts, apparent only to perceptive pattern-recognizers who can hack the game to generate new plays .The reason Thomas Edison was not the first, but number 23, to file a patent for the light bulb, is because the world was \u201cready for it.\u201d He just made it market ready. The Fourier Transform was not conceived at first to help with switching data packets, any more than phones were made for hitching rides and storing payment information\u2026but everything will find new life in new surroundings, as convergent forces pull the opportunity and need into alignment.Every move we make, then, we\u2019re remixed. By standing on the shoulders of our ancestors (or, literally, mountains of their fossils), we reach new fruit on higher branches of the Tree of Knowledge. But the higher that we stand upon this mound of bones, the more that we consume and learn, the more we notice usefulness in everything around us. Some define intelligence as raw resourcefulness; if play is deep enough, we never settle on our definitions, and intelligence explodes as all the cosmos saturates with Purpose.So break out of the way you think about your tools, or even what you qualify as \u201ctools.\u201dEverything\u2019s technology;Everything can be remixed;Nothing new exists except new combinations;And among the precious few things we can say with certainty is this: The future is exapted.All of it lives already in some latent form. If, as the Chinese say, our duty is to \u201clet a hundred flowers bloom,\u201d then all 100 of them are now folded in their buds awaiting that white ray of inspiration to invite them open.Take a look around you. Take a look within you. (Who looks?) Everything you notice is an instrument for forces you can\u2019t comprehend, achieving something that will be opaque to you forever\u2026but perhaps your inquiry will coax one petal from its grip. If you approach your life with ample curiosity and don\u2019t believe the word \u201cjust\u201d (as in \u201conly\u201d) when it rises in you, you will find a hidden life and purpose \u2014 sometimes many \u2014 in the boring and forgotten things.Take every work of art and turn it upside down. Play every instrument the wrong way. Lovemaking \u2014 like its maker, evolution \u2014 thrives on inefficiency and bad ideas. Make love to life by wondering if maybe you already have the tools you need to venture to that far horizon.The only poverty we have, collectively, is of imagination.

For developers, the idea is often called \u201cforking\u201d (like \u201ca fork in the road\u201d, not \u201cwhat you use to eat a salad\u201d). Forking is a familiar term for people who know version control and other heavy-duty systems for keeping track of code.Outside of the tech space, regular people who use business software often refer to these kinds of features as \u201cTrack Changes\u201d or viewing revisions.Neither of these terms worked for explaining the process of building upon other people\u2019s work in Gomix. We needed a word that clearly communicated a few key principles:You start with something that works, not a pile of parts that you have to assemble yourself.You build on the creative work of others, in collaboration with others, because nobody can do it all alone.The process of building on other people\u2019s work should be clearly understandable and based on simple concepts that can be visually represented.Gomix provides sparks \u2014 seeds or notions or starting points you can copy, manipulate and transform into the apps of your dreams. Any time spent worry about overhead or complicated concepts can distract from that vision in your mind.That\u2019s why the word \u201cremix\u201d is so important.Pirijan, one of the Gomix team members who leads our design efforts, talks about why \u201cforking\u201d was never the right name for an act of creation:\u201cWith forking, the assumption is you\u2019ll take a project, make improvements to it, and submit those improvements back to the author to make the original better. That approach is great for building libraries, but not for self expression and making personal tools, which is much more of what we wanted.\u201dThe inspiration for using \u201cremix\u201d to refer to the process of taking an app and personalizing it came from the world of music. Pirijan explains,\u201cWhen you remix a song, you\u2019re taking a version of that track, adding your own stuff onto it, and now it\u2019s a fully original song. That was much closer to what we wanted to inspire people to do\u201dUltimately, that\u2019s exactly the realm we wanted to ground Gomix in \u2014 the world of creativity and inspiration, where the ideas we\u2019re expressing take precedence over the tools used to build them.If you\u2019re looking for inspiration, check out our community, where the sparks of your future ideas might be living this very moment!

This might sound like a difficult balance to maintain, but according to Salt, they didn\u2019t give their academic endeavors too much attention. \u201cWe were big time screw-ups,\u201d she admitted to The Guardian in a 2017 interview. \u201cWe never went to class. We\u2019d just hang around in the lunch room playing cards, and we formed this amazing friendship.\u201dThe YouTube version of Super Nature\u2019s \u201cThe Show Stoppa\u201d.Their supervisor at Sears happened to be Hurby \u201cLuv Bug\u201d Azor, Salt-N-Pepa\u2019s future manager, producer, and songwriter, who also ended up dating Salt for several years. Azor himself was navigating the dual worlds of employee and scholar at the time, working a day job at Sears while he studied sound engineering. When one of his professors assigned a school project that involved recording a song, he decided to use it as an opportunity to work with Salt and Pepa.With no artist identity or name recognition to speak of, the two aspiring MCs dubbed themselves Super Nature and decided to record a response record to Doug E. Fresh and Slick Rick\u2019s hit \u201cThe Show\u201d. Titled \u201cThe Show Stoppa (Is Stupid Fresh)\u201d, they made the demo version in Azor\u2019s attic and a professional version at Power Play Studios with Azor and Marley Marl providing the final mix. Though a bit rough around the edges at times, it\u2019s a bold and clever comeback song that shows the potential Salt-N-Pepa had from the get go.\u201cWe never went to class. We\u2019d just hang around in the lunch room playing cards, and we formed this amazing friendship.\u201d \u2014 SaltOnce the Power Play Studios version of \u201cThe Show Stoppa\u201d was complete, Marley Marl ended up breaking the track on his WBLS radio show. Driving around together a short time later, Salt-N-Pepa heard their record on the radio. The thrill was almost too much to bear. \u201cPep, being the crazy person that she is\u2026She stopped the car in the middle of the boulevard, she jumped out of the car, and she started screaming, \u2018They\u2019re playing my song!

That\u2019s me on the radio!\u2019\u201d Salt told Rolling Stone in a 2017 interview.The Spotify version of \u2018Hot, Cool & Viscious\u2019.They may have felt like superstars after getting their song co-signed by Marley Marl, but the group didn\u2019t take their early success for granted. Determined to improve their sound and grow their fan base, they changed their name from Super Nature to Salt-N-Pepa and performed in front of modest crowds in any venue they could find. \u201cSchools in the middle of the night on lunchroom tables,\u201d Pepa said in a 1988 issue of Spin when asked about their earliest shows. \u201cThank god we never got booed.\u201dAs Salt-N-Pepa worked on their live show, they also released the single \u201cI\u2019ll Take Your Man\u201d and started recording songs for their first full-length album Hot, Cool & Vicious on the record label Next Plateau. The LP dropped in 1986 to modest success, but \u201cI\u2019ll Take Your Man\u201d and three other subsequent singles failed to generate the kind of buzz they were hoping for, and sales for their debut eventually stagnated.\u201cSchools in the middle of the night on lunchroom tables. Thank god we never got booed.\u201d \u2014 PepaIn an effort to re-ignite interest in the record, the group decided to release new single that featured a remix of \u201cTramp\u201d on the A-side. Once the remix was complete, they found themselves in a bit of predicament. \u201cWe needed a B-side, and the B-side was a rush,\u201d Salt told Rolling Stone. \u201cIt was like, \u2018All right guys, we need a B-side, let\u2019s throw something together.\u2019\u201dThe official music video for \u201cTramp\u201d.Knowing that they required something with more pop sensibility to round out their latest single, Hurby Azor gathered the group together for a studio session. As was the case in the creation of many early rap records, the setup for recording the vocals for \u201cPush It\u201d was pretty bare bones. \u201cIt was in Brooklyn, Fresh Gordon\u2019s vocal room was a bathroom, a little tiny bathroom with a microphone,\u201d Salt told Rolling Stone. \u201cIt was very hot and sweaty in there.\u201dThough the decision to record in a bathroom wasn\u2019t always a first choice for pioneering rappers, apparently Azor and Gordon liked the acoustics provided by the bathroom tiles. Whether the reason for recording there was the acoustics or mere necessity, the group got to work \u2014 with Azor providing the lyrics.\u201c\u2018Push It\u2019 to me was very pop. And back then, you were called \u201csell-out\u201d to be pop. So \u2018Tramp\u2019 to me was a more street-credit kind of record than \u2018Push It.\u2019\u201d \u2014 PepaMuch like the \u201cPush It\u201d vocals, the song\u2019s now-famous instrumentation seem to have started with modest beginnings. According to a 1994 feature in New York Magazine, the \u201cPush It\u201d beat first took form when Fresh Gordon played out a riff on a synthesizer that he didn\u2019t have a very high opinion of. But Azor saw that the synth sequence had hit potential and asked him to use it in the song. \u201cFresh Gordon, to his credit, that he\u2019s never officially gotten on the record \u2026 started playing that famous synthesizer line,\u201d Salt told Rolling Stone. \u201cAnd the song really built from there.\u201dThe original 12\" version of \u201cPush It\u201d.Salt-N-Pepa noticed that Azor\u2019s idea for the B-side didn\u2019t follow a conventional song structure, but they weren\u2019t overly concerned because they felt like \u201cTramp\u201d was going to be the breakout cut from the release. \u201cIt was very unusual, because when you listen to \u2018Push It\u2019 there aren\u2019t that many lyrics,\u201d Salt told Rolling Stone. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly music-driven, so it was something different than what we were familiar with. So we just went along and trusted him, as we do, but we didn\u2019t really care for it.\u201dIn addition to not understanding the song in a musical sense, the group also had reservations because they thought it could damage their street cred with its pop sensibilities. \u201c\u2018Push It\u2019 to me was very pop,\u201d Pepa told Rolling Stone. \u201cAnd back then, you were called \u201csell-out\u201d to be pop. So \u2018Tramp\u2019 to me was a more street-credit kind of record than \u2018Push It.\u2019\u201d\u201cIt was in Brooklyn, Fresh Gordon\u2019s vocal room was a bathroom, a little tiny bathroom with a microphone. It was very hot and sweaty in there.\u201d \u2014 Salt\u201cTramp\u201d never quite took off the way the group envisioned. Neither did \u201cPush It\u201d, until the late San Francisco DJ Cameron Paul started playing it at his club gigs and it started to catch on. \u201cWe really owe the success of that record to him,\u201d Salt told Rolling Stone.Salt-N-PepaThe group has shown gratitude towards Paul in many interviews, but there are some apparent discrepancies in how Salt-N-Pepa and Cameron Paul recall his role in the song\u2019s success. Salt-N-Pepa credited Fresh Gordon for developing the famous synth line for \u201cPush It\u201d. But according to an interview with to Cameron Paul, he created a significant amount of the elements from the famous version of \u201cPush It\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s really the only version that\u2019s ever been released, except the original 12\" version which no one ever got,\u201d Paul said in an undated interview for Jarrell \u201cJ-Mas\u201d Mason\u2019s The Time Machine radio show (around the 6:34 mark).When Paul first played \u201cPush It\u201d at gigs he heard a great deal of potential, but he thought that it needed some work to make it an actual hit. So he brought it into his studio and started fiddling with the elements of the original. \u201cI started playing with my keyboards and I just wanted to do a remix for my remix record label Mixx It,\u201d he told The Time Machine. \u201cI came up with bassline and then I start playing around with a melody line on another keyboard, on my Emax I think it was.\u201d\u201cThey didn\u2019t even know \u2018Push It\u2019 existed practically, the record label. And now all of a sudden they\u2019re hearing all this stuff coming from the Bay Area about \u2018Push It\u2019.\u201d \u2014 Cameron PaulAfter he mixed the final version down, he provided KMEL \u2014 the radio station where he had his own show at the time \u2014 with a special radio edit. Once people heard the edit, it caught on like wildfire. \u201cIt just started getting monster requests,\u201d he told The Time Machine. \u201cSo they added that version to their playlist.\u201dThe Mixx-It version of \u201cPush It\u201d.According to Paul, Salt-N-Pepa\u2019s label Next Plateau was stunned when they found out about the Bay Area success of a B-side attached to a year-old album. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even know \u2018Push It\u2019 existed practically, the record label,\u201d Paul told The Time Machine. \u201cAnd now all of a sudden they\u2019re hearing all this stuff coming from the Bay Area about \u2018Push It\u2019. So the program director told them they were playing my remix.\u201dPaul agreed to sell his remix to Next Plateau and the label wasted little time in capitalizing on the growing popularity of the song. \u201cThey released it on 12\" and on the album,\u201d Paul told The Time Machine. \u201cAnd that was the version that they did the video to and that\u2019s what happened. It ended up going platinum.\u201d\u201cWe like to say that song is possessed because it\u2019ll never go away. It has a life of its own.\u201d \u2014 PepaHaving not had the opportunity to interview either party directly, and going strictly off of archived research, it seems like Salt-N-Pepa has somewhat undersold Paul\u2019s involvement in the record while he may have oversold it a bit. If you listen to the original version provided here vs. the video version, it is clear Paul did a great deal to enhance the song musically and make it more club friendly. In other words, he did much more than \u201cturned it over and started playing it,\u201d as Salt told Rolling Stone.The GEICO \u201cPush It\u201d commercial.That said, you can also hear many of the song\u2019s famous synth elements at various points in the original. Paul stated in The Time Machine interview that the original version had \u201cno music, no bass to speak of \u2014 bass line.\u201d The original is certainly much more sparse, but saying it had no music is inaccurate. Adding further intrigue to the story of \u201cPush It\u201d is the fact that the Mixx-It version on YouTube included above has additional elements that were cut out of the remix that Next Plateau later re-released. Perhaps the version they re-released was Cameron Paul radio edit he spoke of?Like the production credits for many famous songs, it seems like Hurby Azor, Fresh Gordon, and Cameron Paul all deserve credit for coming up with the \u201cPush It\u201d beat we know and love today. What percentage of the credit each person should be awarded is a slightly more opaque issue. Sadly, Cameron Paul passed away in March of 2018, making it impossible to further discuss his version of the story.\u201cSalt and I didn\u2019t get it at that time. And we still don\u2019t get it sometimes. We\u2019d be like, \u2018Why\u2019s this song so big?\u2019\u201d \u2014 PepaAfter purchasing Cameron Paul\u2019s remix, Next Plateau released the new version of \u201cPush It\u201d as an A-side and re-issued Hot, Cool & Vicious with the amended version.

That last part is tricky, as it requires both skill in 3D modeling, and the ability to accurately imagine the spatial relationships between multiple moving parts. For that reason, it\u2019s a good idea to start by borrowing mechanisms from existing models, and Grafter is designed to make that easier than ever.Grafter is a software system that allows users to remix 3D-printed machines. (\ud83d\udcf7: Hasso Plattner Institute)As it stands now, borrowing those existing mechanisms is a complex process. You have to find a suitable model created in the same CAD (computer-aided design) software that you\u2019re using, and then you have to tweak it to interface with the rest of your design. Grafter promises to streamline that process by automating the extraction and placement of the part groups that make up a mechanism. You could, for instance, combine the crank of a siren, the gearset of a record player, and a test tube holder to create a hand-operated centrifuge.Grafter is currently in development as a Rhinoceros 3D add-on module at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam, Germany. As shown in the their video, the software allows you to take an existing model, select groups of parts, and then reuse them in your own model. Details are still limited, but Grafter appears to work with STL files, which means you won\u2019t be constrained by the original designer\u2019s software choice.", "responses": 0, "tags": ["3D Printing", "Software", "Technology"]}, {"title": "HR Remixed: Video Human Resources", "post_link": "https://medium.com/@AguDeMarco/hr-remixed-video-human-resources-f0ccedd8de5c?source=search_post", "author_name": "Agu De Marco", "author_link": "https://medium.com/@AguDeMarco", "publish_date": "2014-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2018-05-18", "readtime": "2.06", "claps": 7, "voters": 4, "content": "HR Remixed: Video Human ResourcesHow Video can Effectively Transform your HR DepartmentAgu De MarcoFollowJun 11, 2014 \u00b7 3 min readCompanies are always looking for fresh, new talent that can boost their business, and with social media, there are new ways to seek out and entice that talent.

They are innovative and always leveraging new technologies \u2014 but your internal communications are stuck in the 90s. How can your company satisfy their need for pioneering tech?Give your Human Resources Department the Power of VideoFor many companies, video technology has become a go-to for conducting internal communications thanks to the significant advancement of video tools making it easier to create and deliver video content. Ignite Technologies and Ragan Communications shows us in a recent survey that 71% of the 713 managers, VPs, and company owners questioned are currently using videos to converse with their employees internally. 72% plan to continue increasing their use of video in the workplace.So what exactly are they using video technologies for? The biggest opportunities these companies surveyed felt that video provides is a way to communicate with remote employees and a way to increase alignment with company goals.Already 38% of businesses are using internal videos to conduct their HR services, and this will certainly grow. According to a recent survey, 43% of millennials and 30% of non-millennials do not even read their employee handbooks. And why would they? Employees are more likely to be engaged with training and education material presented in video form. Online videos for internal use, allow employees to easily access the information remotely and can receive training at any time or location. Easing the burden of trying to find an efficient way to put employees through training at the same place and time, and also lessens their reliance on employees to act as trainers.As we become increasingly global and open to exploring new ways of working, such as telecommuting, flexi-time, home offices and more, defining your organization\u2019s internal communication strategy is important. Video is one of the most valuable and engaging tools for companies to use to communicate within their organizations.What Exactly Do I Mean?As a video guy, I\u2019ve seen videos made for many reasons \u2014 just for fun, teaching, etc. The HR ones, however, have really stuck out.Here is a nice simple way to explain dress code:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiqwU7GU3VY&feature=youtu.beOr when needing to explain malware to new employees, a video is a fast and easy way, rather than planning many training sessions:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TMuGYOMXkE&feature=youtu.beInter-office events and/or trainings are great over video because people can get all information fast and visually:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQObxuyb9Bo&feature=youtu.beNext time your company is making an announcement, consider making a video instead!This blog is by Agu De Marco, Co-Founder of Wideo, a DIY animated video production platform.", "responses": 0, "tags": []}, {"title": "Smirnoff\u2019s Lebanon Remixed is Recording The G\u00e4rten\u2019s Crowd THIS Saturday", "post_link": "https://ginosblog.com/smirnoffs-lebanon-remixed-is-recording-the-g%C3%A4rten-s-crowd-this-saturday-e4f38af9b303?source=search_post", "author_name": "Gino Raidy", "author_link": "https://ginosblog.com/@ginoraidy", "publish_date": "2018-04-20", "last_modified_date": "2018-04-22", "readtime": "1.31", "claps": 92, "voters": 3, "content": "Smirnoff\u2019s Lebanon Remixed is Recording The G\u00e4rten\u2019s Crowd THIS SaturdayGino RaidyFollowApr 20, 2018 \u00b7 2 min readI\u2019ve been clubbing for years and it\u2019s been exciting seeing the scene transform from the VIP/VVIP/VVVIP days, to what it is today: a place where many communities and subcultures meet to dance, talk and enjoy their weekends.What\u2019s even more exciting for me, is how amazing our local, homegrown talents are, and how their sound and style is replacing the mainstream music many folks have gotten used to for far too long.That\u2019s why I loved the new \u201cLebanon Remixed\u201d project by Smirnoff.

Von jedem der Paare hat eines ein Mensch gemalt, das andere die Software der T\u00fcbinger errechnet. Menschen k\u00f6nnen bei diesem Quiz nicht besonders gut die Werke der Software von denen der Menschen unterscheiden. Die bislang knapp 44.000 Teilnehmer haben (Stand 22.2.2016) im Schnitt nur 6 von 10 Paaren richtig Mensch und Maschine zugeordnet.Wie viele von den zehn Bilderpaaren haben Menschen korrekt der Software und dem menschlichen Maler zugeordnet? Quelle: http://turing.deepart.io:3838/Ich habe den Quiz mit einem provozierenden Kommentar weiterempfohlen: \u201eWas Software heute alles tut: Bilder malen.\u201c Daraus entspann sich eine interessante Diskussion dar\u00fcber, ob Software wirklich malt und nicht doch etwas ganz anderes tut als Menschen, die Bilder machen.Das Argument gegen die Formulierung \u201eSoftware malt\u201c ist auf den ersten Blick einleuchtend: Ein Kopist ist kein Maler. Software ahmt nur nach, wendet die Techniken der analysierten Gem\u00e4lde nach. So einfach ist der Vergleich aber nicht. Die Software funktioniert so: Sie analysiert Kunstwerke. Sie nimmt dann ein Foto als Input entgegen und wendet die aus Kunstwerken gelernten Muster an und errechnet aus Malstil und Foto ein Bild. Das ist mehr als blo\u00dfes Kopieren, es ist vielleicht weniger als Malen in einem bestimmten Sinn. Vielleicht ist es Remixen?Mein Argument ist: Meister nachahmen und deren Techniken anwenden \u2014 das beschreibt auch die Vorgehensweise vieler menschlicher Maler ziemlich gut.Ob Nachahmung Malerei im Sinne von Sch\u00f6pfung ist, debattierte man lange, bevor Software Malstile erkannte und kopierte. In diesem Aufsatz \u00fcber Kopie als k\u00fcnstlerische Praxis und ihre Bedeutung f\u00fcr die Erforschung der fl\u00e4mischen Buchmalerei aus dem 16. Jahrhundert sieht man das an einigen ganz konkreten Beispielen: Die Illustrationen franz\u00f6sischer und fl\u00e4mischer Handschriften lassen sich kaum zweifelsfrei namentlich bekannten K\u00fcnstlern zuordnen. Die Maler haben massig Motive kopiert und \u00fcber die Verbreitung dieser wiederkehrenden Motive kann man r\u00fcckblickend die Werke einzelnen Werkst\u00e4tten oder Malern zuordnen.Ein anderes Beispiel aus der niederl\u00e4ndischen Renaissance: Pieter Bruegel dem \u00c4lteren werden nur gut 40 Gem\u00e4lde eindeutig zugeschrieben. Es gibt viele andere, bei denen die Urheberschaft kaum zu kl\u00e4ren ist. Einer seiner S\u00f6hne, Pieter Bruegel der J\u00fcngere (aka \u201eH\u00f6llenbruegel\u201c), kopierte Werke des Vaters. Oder er lie\u00df kopieren in seiner Werkstatt. Hat der andere Sohn Jan (aka \u201eSamtbruegel\u201c) aber auch gemacht.Das Fazit dieser Beobachtungen hat schon der Kunsthistoriker Max Jakob Friedl\u00e4nder gezogen, 1946 in \u201eVon Kunst und Kennerschaft\u201c (zitiert nach): Es gibt keine absolut originale Produktion, bilanziert er. Denn:\u201eSelbst der gro\u00dfe und selbstst\u00e4ndige Maler hat nicht nur die Natur, sondern auch Kunstwerke gesehen, Gem\u00e4lde anderer Meister und seine eigenen. Er fu\u00dft auf einer Kunsttradition. In irgendeinem Grad ist jeder Maler Nachahmer und Kopist, so schon, indem er nach eigenen Naturstudien, Zeichnungen, Entw\u00fcrfen ein Gem\u00e4lde ausf\u00fchrt.\u201cZur\u00fcck zur Software. Wenn wir schon bei den unzweifelhaft gro\u00dfen Meistern anerkennen, dass Kopieren zu Ihrer Kunst geh\u00f6rt, kann das wohl kaum das einzige Kriterium sein, um das Schaffen einer Software von dem eines Menschen zu unterscheiden.Die Rolle des k\u00fcnstlichen neuronalen Netzes der T\u00fcbinger Forscher kann man vielleicht mit einem Gedankenspiel pr\u00e4ziser fassen. Stellen wir uns vor, die Software h\u00e4tte f\u00fcr Rembrandt gearbeitet. Von den damals nicht vorhandenen Computern abgesehen, ist das gar nicht so abwegig. Rembrandt hatte Mitarbeiter, in seine Malerwerkstatt. Er malte nicht alles in allen ihm zugeschriebenen Gem\u00e4lden selbst. Bekannt sind zum Beispiel die H\u00e4nde des Pfarrers Johannes Wtenbogaert: Die hat ein Mitarbeiter gemalt. Der Mitarbeiter hat sie in Rembrandt Stil gemalt. Er hat unter Anleitung des Meisters zu dem Werk beigetragen \u2014 einen K\u00fcnstler w\u00fcrden wir ihn vielleicht nicht nennen. Aber dass er malte, sehe ich als unstrittig an. Wenn ein k\u00fcnstliches neuronales Netz wie das der T\u00fcbinger diesen Job erledigen w\u00fcrden, w\u00fcrde sich an der Bewertung dieses Beitrags nichts \u00e4ndern: Rembrandt ist der Maler, auch wenn die H\u00e4nde eine Software aus seiner Werkstatt in kollaborative Fortentwicklung gemalt hat. Wenn wir eine Software haben, die wie der H\u00f6llenbruegel kopiert und die eigene K\u00f6nnerschaft dadurch entwickelt, wird eine andere Stufe erreicht sein.Mein Fazit daraus: Es bringt wenig Erkenntnisgewinn, T\u00e4tigkeiten und Werke danach zu kategorisieren, ob Software oder ein Mensch sie aus\u00fcbt oder geschaffen hat. Man muss sich anschauen, was genau getan wird. So formuliert klingt das banal. Versuchen wir es einmal anders: Der Chefredakteur des britischen Nachrichtenportals The Register Andrew Orlowski hat in einer lesenswerten Polemik diese These formuliert: \u201eWhen the professional classes hollow themselves out, [\u2026], then they can\u2019t really blame automation. They\u2019ve automated themselves.\u201c Eines seiner Beispiele:\u201eEditors look at what hashtags are trending. They instruct that material is generated to feed that demand. The material is published in such a way to lure for Google News or Facebook algorithms. Behind the scenes, robots place the ads that accompany the material. More robots then click the ads \u2026 around half of the ads served are never seen. It\u2019s not really a \u00bbwriter-reader\u00ab relationship any more. It\u2019s a robot-robot relationship.

I thought we\u2019d kick it off with an interesting piece of news \u2014 Netflix is testing having users choose multiple narratives for its TV shows. I think this is an important piece of news.Technology has affected art in predictable ways \u2014 it has made it easy to create, consume and distribute. Think about how easily art like music, photo and books can be created, remixed, consumed and distributed thanks to the likes of YouTube, Facebook, iTunes, Kindle, etc.As technologist Kevin Kelly predicted in his book \u201cThe Inevitable\u201d, an important part of the creative process is the ability to \u201cremix\u201d content. Musicians do this on YouTube all the time, Instagram\u2019s filters are arguably a remix tool and most bloggers does this with content from books and other blogs. This process hasn\u2019t been easy to do with video because video technology hasn\u2019t lent itself to be flexible in the same way. So, Netflix\u2019s move could be the beginning of a very interesting journey.The fight for video supremacy. As far as internet video goes, there are, very roughly, 2 categories of video giants \u2014 - User generated video: YouTube and Facebook- Original content: Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, et alThis is a rough categorization because YouTube has sought to move beyond user generated video for a few years now (it phased out the \u201cBroadcast Yourself\u201d tagline around 2010). And, Facebook has been investing in video in a big way \u2014 announcing an experiment this week to add original shows to a \u201cspotlight module.\u201d What makes this all interesting is that Twitter has been going all in on video of late. And, AOL announced this week it would join the video fun, too.All this focus on video makes sense. Everybody wants a share of TV budgets and the pie is large enough to have multiple winners.How would AOL compete, you might ask? It\u2019s a fair question. My sense is that Verizon (which owns AOL) will use the new US administration\u2019s move to relax net neutrality to provide video content to Verizon for free. If this works, we might see an acquisition of a video player by AT&T in the future. I\u2019d be surprised if either telco manages to gain significant share, however.The Snap IPO \u2014 asking a better question. There\u2019s a lot been written about the Snap IPO of late. They\u2019ve largely been similar in tone to this article on Forbes \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t confuse popular with profitable.\u201d I think these reactionary points of view one week into the IPO are generally shortsighted.The question to ask where Snapchat is concerned is not \u2014 \u201cHow will Snap make money given its current business model?\u201d A better question is \u2014 \u201cWill Snapchat be able to grow its base of user attention?\u201d The price of a stock is largely determined by the discounted value of future cash flows. It is nearly impossible to predict the future \u2014 and this is especially the case with consumer technology companies. As far as advertising businesses go, however, money follows attention. If Snap can grow user attention, they\u2019ll do fine. This is very hard when Facebook is powerful competitor meets copycat.But, buying Snap\u2019s stock is about the option value. The bear case for Snap is straightforward \u2014 Facebook didn\u2019t have to contend with a Facebook sized behemoth when it went public. Twitter did, and that hasn\u2019t gone well so far. However, the bull case is that it is only a matter of time before all this copying catches up with Facebook. While Facebook has the insane advantage of porting Snap\u2019s features into one of four powerful apps (Main app, Messenger, Instagram, Whatsapp), there are costs to blind copying that show up in the form of a disjointed user experience in the long run. We\u2019ll have to wait and see how this plays out.Einstein, Watson and AI. There were many cute headlines like \u201cEinstein, meet Watson\u201d this week with the partnership between Salesforce\u2019s Einstein and IBM\u2019s Watson. It isn\u2019t immediately obvious why this matters. They said \u2014 \u201cBy combining local shopping patterns, weather and retail industry data from Watson with customer-specific shopping data and preferences from Salesforce Einstein, a retailer will be able to automatically send highly personalized and localized email campaigns to shoppers.\u201dIt looks like IBM\u2019s \u201cWeather.com\u201d properties were a big selling point for Salesforce.com. And, there\u2019s certainly something to be said for the effect of weather on sales and marketing decisions (SFDC\u2019s bread and butter). For IBM, the biggest win here seems to be offering consulting services to customers who are implementing salesforce tools \u2014 an industry estimated to be >100B.I also see this as a move by two tech giants who want to up their focus on artificial intelligence.Related, Ben Evans\u2019 post on \u201cvoice and the uncanny valley of AI\u201d is a must read. TLDR \u2014 - Voice seems suited for unrestricted and general purpose interfaces given the lack of friction involved. However, voice only works well (currently) for narrow domains (music, turning on the lights)- The tech giants are investing heavily into voice as a source of input as the industry is looking for the next big thing. While it is clear that voice is a big thing, it still doesn\u2019t seem to be that next big thing.Uber, culture and Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture. Uber\u2019s had a rough few weeks. The news this week is that Travis is looking for a COO. A COO isn\u2019t going to do much by herself (yes, herself) \u2014 we all know that. An organization\u2019s culture is a collection of norms and processes that describe how the organization behaves when no one is watching. A company\u2019s culture is a result of 3 things \u2014 1. The Leader\u2019s personal culture and, to a lesser extent, the culture of the executive team2. Who they hire, fire and promote3. How decisions are madeThese aren\u2019t easy to change as organizations scale. But, the awesome Ben Horowitz took a historical detour to the Haitian slave revolution led by Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture to tell us there is still hope. Ben lays out 4 ideas \u2014 1. Keep what works (e.g. Steve Jobs keeping Apple\u2019s culture of innovative devices instead of simply copying Microsoft)2. Create shocking rules (e.g. \u201cDesks as doors\u201d at Amazon and \u201cMove fast, break things\u201d at Facebook make people question why these rules exist)3. Incorporate people from other cultures and insert them at higher levels within the organization (e.g. Google hiring Diane Greene to create Google\u2019s Enterprise product culture)4. Make decisions that demonstrate priorities (e.g. Netflix going all in on streaming)The Haitian revolution story is amazing. Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture did all of this and for good reason \u2014 slave culture had never led to a successful revolution. Ben\u2019s video is a great way to spend 30 minutes if you are interested in learning more.And, keeping companies aside for moment, this matters as much for our personal lives just as much. Our norms and processes define our culture. These norms and processes are more powerful than any strategy we lay out (\u201cI will exercise 5 times a week this new year).In the long run, culture is strategy.Prefer receiving this via a weekend email?

But at what cost?by Niela OrrWhen the second season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt returns to Netflix this week, viewers will be reacquainted with its earworm of a theme song. You know the one: With a hefty dose of Auto-Tune, knockout catchphrases like \u201cfemales are strong as hell,\u201d and jaunty, eye-popping visual effects that match the personality of its titular star, the song crescendos as the shell-shocked optimist Kimmy Schmidt is led out of her underground bunker captivity by a SWAT team. It\u2019s no surprise that a remix of this quirky song went viral itself, garnering more than four million hits. The virality of the song hinges on the emotional delivery of Mike Britt, the actor who plays the neighbor to the show\u2019s cult-leader kidnapper and the women he held captive, an obvious nod to the Ariel Castro case that unfolded in May 2013. Playing alongside video of Britt\u2019s character singing is a split-screen montage of white people in archival footage performing classical music, clapping, and simply looking.In an interview with Wired, one of the remixers, Evan Gregory, dished that he and his team had searched news sites for soundbites they use to \u201csongify\u201d the news, which is a word he and his siblings, known collectively as The Gregory Brothers, coined to describe their brand of remixing. \u201cSeventy percent of our job is scouring websites like the Huffington Post and the Drudge Report, which is really a fate I wouldn\u2019t wish on my worst enemy,\u201d he said. Auto-Tune, the de rigueur audio effect of internet remixers, is used heavily in \u201csongified\u201d news because it mechanizes the human voice, thereby turning vocal tinges of fear and other heavy emotions into cheer. This whole process essentially turns segments of the 11 o\u2019clock news into viral jams, stripping away tragedy to create fun pop.What he didn\u2019t say is that Britt\u2019s portrayal is refracted through viral news reports of Antoine Dodson, Sweet Brown, and Charles Ramsey. These videos are several years old and have been discussed at length in the pop culture sphere, but because new videos, like those featuring Michelle Clark, Michelle Dobyne, and Hazel London continuously make headlines, the original trio are still potent cultural references, even now. Dodson\u2019s known for giving an interview after he helped thwart an attacker who tried to rape his sister, Sweet Brown for a statement she gave soon after her apartment complex caught fire, and Ramsey for the interview he gave to a scrum of reporters moments after rescuing Castro survivors Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus, and Michelle Knight. The way Britt\u2019s character is presented (poor, dressed casually, talking off-the-cuff) parodies the viral stars when they were first caught on camera by a news crew. And the Gregory Brothers\u2019 remixes provide a particularly disorienting filter of the white gaze, in that they give a pleasing, innocuous-seeming lift to grave accounts of violence and danger. Think of the Gregorys\u2019 remixes as modern send-ups of blues tunes transformed into dancing ditties, although the songified blues use real-life trauma and lyrics comprised of formal testimony.Antoine Dodson Crazy Laugh Action / Via youtube.comAntoine Dodson was the first news interviewee to have his face splashed all over the internet when his video went viral in July 2010. He was interviewed by a Huntsville, Alabama, station about the attack on his sister, when a man climbed into her second-floor window and tried to rape her. The lyrics to the song double as his statement to reporter Elizabeth Gentle (compiled from the original news report).Well, obviously, we have a rapist in Lincoln Park. He\u2019s climbing in your windows, he\u2019s snatching your people up, trying to rape \u2019em. So you need to hide ya kids, hide ya wife, and hide ya husbands cause they raping everybody out here\u2026We got ya T-shirt. You done left fingerprints and all. You are so dumb. You are really dumb, for real\u2026You don\u2019t have to come and confess that you did it. We\u2019re looking for you. We gon\u2019 find you, I\u2019m lettin you know now. So you can run and tell that. Homeboy.The Gregory Brothers have Auto-Tuned Dodson and Ramsey to great success; the song made out of Dodson\u2019s interview, \u201cBed Intruder,\u201d charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and subsequently went platinum. And Brown, Ramsey, and Dodson became internet stars alongside grumpy cats, Norwegian comedians, and laughing babies: Ramsey and Brown appeared on national morning shows and TV commercials; Dodson became a Halloween costume. Combined, their videos have been viewed hundreds of millions of times on YouTube. But, while the babies have a chance to grow up and become notable for something else, and the \u201cDouble Rainbow\u201d guy is also known as an MMA fighter, in the pop culture realm, Dodson and company are locked in the frames of their original traumatic interviews and the numerous Auto-Tuned pop and hip-hop remixes that have come after. Giving an interview to a news station is customary after tragedy; what\u2019s less common is that people become permanently enshrined for their trauma, unless of course, they\u2019re black. The ways trauma is repackaged quickly after interviews are recorded is a result of our fast-moving media cycle. And it\u2019s true that black internet stars have talked to news reporters in memorable ways that make them subject to public fascination. But it\u2019s also true that black viral interviewees hardly had any time to grieve before their feelings were repurposed for the zeitgeist, which is unseemly given how, seen through the mainstream white gaze, black pain has been romanticized (the \u201crace\u201d movies of the early 20th century) or made comical (minstrel shows).(L-R) Michael Gregory, Evan Gregory, Sarah Fullen Gregory, and Andrew Rose Gregory of The Gregory Brothers appear on stage at the 19th Annual Webby Awards on May 18, 2015 in New York City. Brian Ach / Getty ImagesSo it\u2019s a little odd that these viral interviewees are called minstrels themselves. Dodson, Brown, and Ramsey have been criticized at length for their statements to news reporters. Writer Fidel Martinez claimed that the videos \u201care essentially a modern day minstrel show,\u201d and Aisha Harris, writing for Slate, suggested that the popularity of the videos might be due to \u201ca persistent, if unconscious, desire to see black people perform.\u201d Indeed, when Hazel London laments the transformation of the La Bella Noche club into the OK Corral, she\u2019s either called ghetto or uproariously funny; Charles Ramsey\u2019s turn as hero is hampered by claims that his appearance and language make him a coon or minstrel; and Sweet Brown is either a hilarious lady or a mammy figure incarnate.Black viral interviewees hardly had any time to grieve before their feelings were repurposed for the zeitgeist.Those original impromptu interviews that ended up across the internet represent the ways black people can be randomly captured in a spectrum of cell phone videos, street cams, and news crews in order to be consumed for entertainment. Much like how rampant use of the word \u201cbasic\u201d is an expression of class anxiety, some critical responses to these viral videos are expressions of some black people\u2019s camera anxiety, or fear of surveillance. Tech theorist and inventor Steve Mann defines surveillance as \u201corganizations observing people.\u201d Because the viral news interviewees are taped and originally shared by news organizations, they fall under Mann\u2019s definition of surveillance and it goes without saying that those being surveilled have less power than those behind the camera. He\u2019s even coined a new term, \u201csousveillance,\u201d to describe what happens when people who are themselves surveilled aim their recording devices at organizations who wield more power.Simone Browne engages Mann\u2019s concepts of surveillance at length in her book Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness. She asserts that blacks have always been under the white gaze. \u201cIn the time of slavery that citizenry (the watchers) was deputized through white supremacy to apprehend any fugitive who escaped from bondage (the watched), making for a cumulative white gaze that functioned as a totalizing surveillance,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe violence of this cumulative gaze continues in the postslavery era.\u201dBrown, Dodson, and Ramsey show that even when you speak for yourself, you have to be careful who you\u2019re speaking to.In this moment of the \u201cpostslavery era,\u201d where viral videos are now the norm, it feels necessary to always be prepared to speak on camera, as this blog entry by a business software company, and this one, also by a business blogger, warn.Beneath their cheery veneer, the remix videos are implicitly a PSA against being unprepared when someone\u2019s camera captures and then places you under that \u201ccumulative gaze.\u201d Even though camera anxiety has manifested via fear of viral videos, it\u2019s not a new phenomenon; the tradition of drylongso, or ordinary, black testimony, shows that surveillance and the manipulation of our images have always been persistent problems for American black people. Brown, Dodson, and Ramsey show that even when you speak for yourself, you have to be careful who you\u2019re speaking to.In his 1903 opus The Souls of Black Folk, African American philosopher W.E.B. Du Bois describes a phenomenon called double-consciousness.It is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one\u2019s self through the eyes of others, of measuring one\u2019s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his two-ness \u2014 an American, a Negro, two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.Under double-consciousness, black people struggle with two separate perceptions: how whites see them, and how they see themselves. Writing for the Huffington Post, Rev. Charles E. Williams II placed the perception of the Sweet Brown and Charles Ramsey videos in a tradition of double-consciousness. He wrote, \u201cSo yes the response that trivialize[s] the contribution and especially the heroic effort of Mr. Ramsey is racist. However, if you are like myself you laugh not in ridicule or disgust but laugh because they have learned not to slip into their other character and speak just as colloquially as Brown and Ramsey, which is to say without reserve.\u201dThe term viral, in one reading of these responses, has a double meaning. It suggests black pathology, or black people\u2019s innate dysfunction. What it means to actually know these people, after or in spite of seeing them online, is still obscured, even for black viewers, because the videos take on lives of their own. It\u2019s difficult to find the original interviews on YouTube, since they\u2019ve been copied and manipulated countless times by remixers. Consider this flip: The line \u201cI was attacked by some idiot out here in the projects,\u201d spoken by attack survivor Kelly Dodson, is a bright, Auto-Tuned adlib on the \u201cBed Intruder\u201d song that builds to the song\u2019s bridge, as Antoine Dodson\u2019s phrase \u201cso dumb\u201d is repeated several times. The editing reduces her comment to a simple, trite soundbite divorced from the details that ground the viewer in her in reality: the trash can the intruder used to hoist himself up to her room, the shattered glass on her bedroom floor, the baby she gestured toward, who had been sleeping next to her when the man broke in. We just hear \u201cidiot in the projects,\u201d and then \u201cso dumb,\u201d which is maybe a connection we\u2019re supposed to make.\u201cWe are a nation primarily because we think we are a nation.\u201dAlthough they\u2019ve been framed within double-consciousness, Dodson, Brown, and Ramsey have never been placed in the drylongso tradition, of black people speaking directly and without the reserve that Williams mentions. Drylongso means \u201cordinary,\u201d according to John Langston Gwaltney, the anthropologist who edited the book Drylongso: A Self Portrait of Black America. The term is referenced in blues songs by Robert Johnson, Skip James, and King Solomon Hill, among others. In his book on blues speech, Steven Calt briefly traces the etymology of drylongso from meaning \u201cfor no good reason\u201d in blues songs, \u201cfate\u201d in \u201930s Harlem, and \u201cordinary\u201d in present-day speak. In Drylongso, Gwaltney interviewed 47 everyday black Americans and compiled their often candid, humorous, and critical testimonies of life in America into this anthology. The viral interviewees are a part of this tradition, though at a considerable distance that technology has made plain.Drylongso follows in the footsteps of novelist and pioneering black anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston\u2019s ethos, that it\u2019s important for black people to collect each other\u2019s\u2019 stories. The book, Gwaltney writes, \u201cstems from my long-held view that traditional Euro-American anthropology has generally failed to produce ethnographers who are capable of assessing black American culture in terms other than romantic, and from my belief in the theory-building and analytic capacities of my people.\u201d It\u2019s compiled of first-person testimonies of black people that range in age from teenagers to the elderly. The respondents wax poetic on life in America, black nationalism, racism, sex, intraracial dynamics, and rich quotidian experiences that demonstrate what the anthropologist calls \u201ccore black culture.\u201d Core black culture, in his view, is made up of everyday black Americans who are neither rich or bourgeois, financially or in spirit. Hannah Nelson (not her real name), a 61-year-old piano teacher, sums up Gwaltney\u2019s project: \u201cOur speech is most directly personal, and every black person assumes that every other black person has a right to a personal opinion.\u201d Nelson\u2019s entire testimony is rife with these philosophical musings that come to define the idea of black culture. \u201cWe are a nation,\u201d she tells Gwaltney, \u201cprimarily because we think we are a nation.\u201dSweet Brown Warren Wilding / Via youtube.comGwaltney conducted his interviews in the mid-1970s, in his old neighborhood in New Jersey. Many of his interviewees organized informal gatherings in their homes, and Gwaltney would talk with them there. \u201cI wanted both the contexts and venues of interviews and folk seminars to be as informal and removed from officialdom as possible,\u201d he writes in the introduction. He wanted participants to feel free to speak honestly, so he changed the names of all of the people he talked with. Although he disdained \u201cofficialdom,\u201d Gwaltney also wanted to avoid man-on-the-street interviews, writing that the street corner is \u201cno place to consort with the soul of a great and subtle people living under conquest conditions.\u201d He flat out denounces those kind of interviews elsewhere in the book, saying that Drylongso is not another collection of \u201cstreet-corner exotica.\u201d The viral news interviews of the 2010s don\u2019t exactly fit Gwaltney\u2019s standards because most of them are collected on the street, but he admits in the book that from his POV in anthropology, he\u2019s not the only authority on the matter. Although the viral news reports might be \u201cstreet-corner exotica,\u201d his own interviews are not without issues.\u201cI think this anthropology is just another way to call me a nigger,\u201d a man named Othman Sullivan told Gwaltney. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you all day long, Lankie, but don\u2019t interview me,\u201d Lucy Ann Melton responded in kind. The difference between talking and being interviewed is a distinction that proves critical for both Melton and someone like Sweet Brown 40 years later. Whether or not the white gaze is filtered by the exoticizing eye of anthropology, the \u201cofficialdom\u201d of news stations, or the fun pastiche of the Gregory Brothers, it ends up acting as a form of surveillance. Explaining why he didn\u2019t include talking heads in his documentary Dreams Are Colder Than Death, which focuses on black life in America 50 years after the March on Washington, the filmmaker Arthur Jafa said that \u201cthe camera functions as a surrogate for the white gaze and [black people] put on these survival modalities.\u201dThe viral interviews are not the only contemporary cultural products that can be put in the drylongso tradition. Rooted in a similar theme, the protagonist of Cauleen Smith\u2019s film Drylongso is a young black woman who takes Polaroids of black men on the streets of Oakland. And director Kahlil Joseph\u2019s short m.A.A.d., which is inspired by and scored to music from Kendrick Lamar\u2019s album Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City, utilizes images of everyday black Americans in Compton to powerful effect. The closing montage, set to Lamar\u2019s song \u201cSing About Me,\u201d in which the rapper speaks from the perspective of two Compton associates, features portraits of black people at convenience stores, parking lots, and beauty parlors.WATTSTAX, Richard Pryor, 1973 Everett CollectionAnother visual counterpart for Gwaltney\u2019s Drylongso is Mel Stuart\u2019s landmark concert film Wattstax. Wattstax begins with Richard Pryor shrouded in darkness, and then The Dramatics\u2019 \u201cWhatcha See Is Whatcha Get,\u201d plays during the film\u2019s title sequence. Wattstax is dynamic for how much screen time ordinary black people from Watts get to talk about subjects as vast as natural hair, the government\u2019s treatment of blacks, dating, and when they first realized they were black. Pryor plays a kind of chorus who anchors the film, maintaining humor throughout. Pryor\u2019s presence is significant because both he and the concert scenes balance the film\u2019s heaviness, which is a model of showing black humor in the face of trauma. Stuart, though white, doesn\u2019t omit the references to historical pain and erasure by playing up the music, so the film remains a testament to balance in the documentary form. There are jokes and drama intensified by the camera\u2019s presence; uplifting gospel contrasted with gutbucket funk; the noise of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum cut with moments of silence created by people in deep thought.It seems no coincidence that Stuart chose to play \u201cWhatcha See Is Whatcha Get\u201d over images of black people doing mundane things; the choice may be a racist articulation of the film\u2019s theme, that what you see in these people is what you get, that they are easy to understand because their words and presentations are so basic, that they represent a kind of authenticity. I see that, and also read the lyrics \u201cwhat you see is what you get,\u201d originally a man\u2019s romantic plea, as a theory of our viewing consumption of viral interviews. What we see in Dodson, Brown, and Ramsey (mammy, ghetto, hilarious, minstrel, etc.) reflects what we want to get from them, and the lasting messages we take away from their interviews.Returning to Hannah Nelson\u2019s claim, that \u201cwe are a nation primarily because we think we are a nation,\u201d is crucial to understand a constant in black culture: the white gaze. Black nationalism, not race, seems to be contingent upon shared experiences or at least a collective perspective, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had a unified view since the civil rights movement, if then. However, the repetition of respectability in the critiques of the viral videos, or that black people should be aware of how they present to the world at all times, is proof that perception continues to be an issue many black people navigate. Perhaps the long-standing suspicion of the white gaze and its surveillance is one last remnant of Gwaltney\u2019s core black culture, even in the digital age when the vast number of different voices online show a mix of black points of view. In this way, it\u2019s easy to read the finger-wagging of respectability-minded black people as also a beckoning toward close-held knowledge. They are watching you. Black conservatism in this light could possibly have a dual purpose: to scold, yes, but also to hold.With our fingers on the share and retweet buttons, we become complicit in the surveillance of these black people.The comments made by Elizabeth Gentle, from a follow-up interview with Dodson days after the initial video, address some of the responses the station received for airing the clip. \u201cNow some have contacted our newsroom saying that interviews with people like Antoine reflect poorly on the community. To that, I say censoring people like Antoine is far worse.\u201d For sure, censoring Dodson is terrible, but what about the ways the news report videos are distributed? That may be far worse. News cameras aren\u2019t the primary tools of surveillance. With our fingers on the share and retweet buttons, we become complicit in the surveillance of these black people, by spreading their manipulated images around. Forget going viral, these videos are metastasizing.No one knows the ups-and-downs of internet stardom quite like Antoine Dodson, whose life has been a whirlwind of celebrity and notoriety following his initial fame. A recent video from Dodson\u2019s Instagram page shows him coping with his post-fame life as a school worker, still dogged by his claim to fame: \u201cI made it to 800 followers, yay woohoo. I\u2019m a fucking celebrity,\u201d he said, mean-mugging the camera. The way he delivers that line makes you think that \u201cfucking celebrity\u201d is a special designation made for him, Ramsey and Brown \u2014 meaning one who is still visible but mired in some of the same class-based circumstances that made them famous. After Dodson performed \u201cBed Intruder\u201d with Michael Gregory at the 2010 BET Hip Hop Awards, comedian Mike Epps joked, \u201cI know that was messed up, but they was able to buy they mama a house and get them out the projects with that song right there. I don\u2019t know how long they gon\u2019 live there\u2026\u201d In 2014, Dodson boxed the alleged \u201cbed intruder\u201d in a match hosted by Kato Kaelin, an event that seemed to confirm Epps\u2019s theory that Dodson\u2019s trip out of the hood would be short-lived.Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is about a character, who, much like Antoine Dodson, transitions from her old community into a new one. The line \u201cUnbreakable! They alive dammit\u201d stands out so much in the Gregorys\u2019 remix because it seems to call back to the other videos they\u2019ve flipped; the infallible spirit of black survivors seems to be the main theme of their songs. In the Gregorys, Kimmy Schmidt\u2019s producers hired the right remixers because their brand is synonymous with that kind of triumphant flip. They\u2019ve even taken one of the oldest viral videos and spun it slightly differently.Leprechaun sketch in Mobile, Alabama. Botmib / Via youtube.comThe \u201cCrichton Leprechaun\u201d meme is one of the first viral sensations of the YouTube era, and caused a stir when it debuted in March 2006. The meme is a news report of black residents in the Crichton section of Mobile, Alabama, discussing a mythic leprechaun many residents say is hiding in a tree. It\u2019s been viewed over 25 million times, no doubt helped by the \u201camateur sketch\u201d of the leprechaun, which is hilariously a nondescript, badly drawn face under a leprechaun\u2019s belted hat. The video is funny largely because the black people of Crichton speak in their own voices about the nebulous, elusive figure. Some say it\u2019s a leprechaun, while others think it\u2019s a crackhead. The shape-shifting \u201cleprechaun\u201d is oddly enough a metaphor for the imprecise, always-shifting ways the videos of Dodson, Brown, and Ramsey, and the others, continue to be viewed years later.The Crichton meme is a viral video of black people that stings less, because the power of storytelling, though still contained by the news station, is also in the Crichton residents\u2019 hands. With their flip phones aimed at the tree and the news equipment, you see sousveillance in action. It\u2019s black people making their own myths, and reveling in the joy of a spectacle they created. If you watch the Gregorys\u2019 Crichton remix, you don\u2019t quite get that. The song, \u201cI Want the Gold,\u201d is typical songified fare: There\u2019s repetition of key lines like \u201cthe leprechaun could be a crackhead,\u201d and is free of the glee of the original, accompanied by a guitar riff and a real-life interpretation of the leprechaun, which kills the fun of imagining what the thing is. At the end of the video, the Gregorys hawk their Songify app, crooning \u201cYou can songify yourself on the Songify app.\u201d While deputizing us to do their work, the Gregorys are almost always dressed as reporters and anchormen. Their authority is made plain: They don\u2019t want you to forget that their power lies on the other side of the camera. \u2022The Gregory Brothers \u201cI Want the Gold\u201d.

It sucks you, word by word, sentence by sentence. You are informed, thrilled, and engrossed. Before you know it, hours have have passed, the sun has dropped past the horizon, and your head has barely lifted from the page or device.But writing a well-written story is not easy. It can be a brutal, hair-pulling experience. Writing well \u2014 except for the inordinately talented natural writer (they make it look so easy)\u2014 is often an exasperating experience.That\u2019s part of the attraction for the session, \u201cRemixing research: How to translate research into multimedia stories,\u201d held at the MIT Media Lab on Saturday, Oct. 24.The goal was to help people translate often complicated research or work into comprehensible, interesting work, using multimedia. The event was aimed at researchers, but many others from different disciplines showed up. About 50 people attended. (btw: This same story, with a very different contextual structure, using FOLD. Check it out.)In a few short hours, five speakers (transparency alert: I was one) sketched out ways writers can use video, audio, data, film and a new contextual platform called FOLD to create interesting work.It was a whirlwind tour of a variety of media and how it can best be used to create interesting yet informative stories. (Here\u2019s another take on the session by Eric Convey of the Boston Business Journal.)Here\u2019s some highlights:alexis hope talked about a new platform called FOLD that makes it easy to tell complex stories. Hope, who is creative director of FOLD, said the idea was to create a platform so that anyone could write their own explainer. The system uses a vertical spine for the main story, while context cards are placed on a horizontal axis. The cards can contain text, video, images, maps, even tweets. It\u2019s an intriguingly new way of storytelling and a prime example of the new style of \u201catomizing\u201d stories by breaking them into their component pieces so they can be reassembled in new and creative ways.@GideonGil, a managing editor with @statnews, talked about how the new vertical will try to cover complicated health and medical science for a broad audience \u2014 not an easy chore. One way is through the use of metaphors. He showed a short, effective video in which a scientist compared making changes in genes to repairing typos in a story. The Stat site, which will employ heavy use of multimedia, launches in a week or two.Wendi C. Thomas on Twitter@gideongil of @statnews kicks off #remixingresearch workshop at @medialab #fold pic.twitter.com/VKJuOKSS0mt.coJames Maxwell Larkin, a producer at Radio Open Source,talked about the advantages of podcasting as a medium. It turns out that people can get much more wrapped up in a long podcast than in some other mediums, he said. Perhaps it\u2019s because they enjoy listing to an interesting program on their long commute. Or maybe it feels like you are \u201cin\u201d on the conversation. There is a certain intimacy as well.Phil Gara, a documentary film maker and graduate of the MIT Sloan School, talked about how the power of film \u2014 and how (relatively) inexpensive it has become. There is a power in film that resonates with people. And while quality filmmaking is a plus, the content is what makes a good film, He listed some tips for people: Make sure the audio is good. Poor audio is a sure sign of an amateur production. Bad audio is a bigger turnoff to people than even bad video.Matt Carroll talked about nonlinear storytelling and the atomization of news. For instance, an example of nonlinear storytelling is a data story done by myself, Alvin Chang, Andrew Ba Tran, and Catherine Cloutier called \u201cDreamtown\u201d for the The Boston Globe which allowed people to use an interactive site to find good towns to live in.Matt Carroll runs the Future of News initiative at the MIT Media Lab.

No, they don\u2019t think so. The life of internet in consumer space is very short, it has already seen bubbles come and go. Technology, businesses, and users cause bubbles.My early involvement in social networks and thankfully the \u201cbig data\u201d revealed to me.Users are not loyalThey get bored very easilyThey are always hunting for the newYou the makers have significant biasesMakers are not always building something Magical. They are remixing.Those who built, build it before it became a term in the business booksThose who understood, Remixed it very well. Many of the remixes in consumer internet were not always by design, it was by chance, by user adoption and by pure remixing into something new. No business book predicted, no consumer survey revealed or no TED talks were given on a new Tik Tok.TikTok surpassed Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat & YouTube in downloads last monthAccording to data from app intelligence firm Sensor Tower, TikTok\u2019s installs were higher than those of Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube in the U.S. last month.We will tik tok later.For me theInternet of today is classifiedsThe Internet disrupted classifieds. Rules and Rulers of the game were changed.US Online and Traditional Media Advertising Outlook, 2018\u20132022Early internet was underestimated as nonseriousGoogle ads, the most significant online classified system changed the gameNow nonserious and ignored publishers created the new industryFacebook was a college notice board which became consumer classifieds. It did this only with interactive classifieds system and running your publishing network for your network of family and friends.They are many more such opportunities to classified \u2014 The new game is in serving media, games and interactivity.Why did early social networks fail? Probably they were trying to solve more significant problems. Connecting the entire world through focussing too much on Seven Degrees of Separation and finding similar purposes. Sending a purposeful message in a bottle. They also saw what LinkedIn was doing and they got sidetracked by it. They wanted to become LinkedIn for real friends.Friends just wanted to sit together and trash talk. Yes, the unplanned side effect will be profound moments and changing the world. The people who were changing the world went slow and steady at non-silicon-valley speed and built Open Source. They got backdoor entry into your browsers and phones.Startups of today have a great opportunity today in breaking the Internet. If Amazon and Uber are both to be looked at, they are breaking your business. One by covering all the use case under e-commerce and one by covering one use case. Look carefully Uber is also building more use cases, it would be a big loss to take FOCUS too literally. That's for readers and highlight analysis, not for doers.Just for controversy, I also hold other views. I can hold multiple views. That\u2019s completely okay.Startups have never been focussed. They search for shiny new objects They search for problems to solve. Initial startups solve the problem. They Come and Go. The billion-dollar success that you see today, is a good implementor of tried and tested.To give a wild comment \u2014To celebrate Tesla & Elon Musk, I wouldn\u2019t forget the work of others who have participated in the game much before. If you heard of Simulation Theory today, that\u2019s not my problem.I want that Shiney New ObjectThe Social Media Shiny Object SyndromeNot just from the user side but also from the business side. Facebook acquired WhatsApp at billions. This was shocking to the Wastern side of the planet, not too the eastern side of the planet. Facebook was also good at identifying Instagram\u2019s potential.A less talked about a point.Messenger and Photos have covered the language and participation barrier of the Internet.Remember\u2026To take that photo you are not searching for a good camera, its already there with you. You are not searching for an object to click. It's anything in front of you. You are not panicking for photo transfers, its already been uploaded.To get that joke in Hindi you are not going anywhere. It\u2019s coming to your handphone. Most probably you will react by a like or emoticon.Tik Tok has provided a new remixing tool. Now the user gratification is not that you liked my content. The user gratification is \u201cI made something and got likes on it\u201d.The new generation of users coming on to the internet are not going to follow their elders or senior internet. Your current products are already outdated for them. Only new recent introduction to them regarding hardware was Amazon Eco and going from touch to commands. No wonder, initially they are just commanding it for playing pop music.Yet another worry for the current internet biggies. Damn, they never stop chasing the new.Understanding User FatigueBored Out of Their MindsThe young users are not finding the right engaging stimulus in the standard school system in content. They find the nonuseful stimulus online to keep their minds engages. Both the incidents of boredom but of different kinds.While Facebook & Mr. Mark Z is criticized for many things. I find him cool for these 2 things.Making Hoodies cool in boardroomsNot underestimating the competition and new developments for users.He knows what is user fatigue, how users get bored quickly, how they need constant stimulus on any internet property. Good or bad, I shall not comment.The Internet itself is seeing big boring mouse and keyboard internet, it adjusted for the small screen, the poor thing has to gear up for Voice \u2014 Amazon EcoYoungsters too are already fatigued by consumption. They are probably getting a stimulus of interactivity and doing their own thing. Just like your grandparents felt when they moved from Shops to Malls, just like your parents felt when switching to Amazon and just like how these youngsters will feel by getting new options for their fingers, clicks, and sense of producing something.Facebook is already tik toking. Wait for sometime.School education apps have lot to learn from properties like Facebook & Tik Tok.Product Development & StartupsIf you are starting up.Don\u2019t underestimate tried and tested ideas \u2014 Always remember remixing of classifiedsAvoid user fatigues \u2014 bugs, longer steps, less documentation and ignoring if someone else is doing it better. The list is very long.After the product stabilization, you cannot avoid Shiney new objects.

I have always suggested Thimble as an easier place to localize curriculum.The directions would be:Hit the remix button.Localize the content.Hit publish.Then the curriculum could be reviewed. If it met localization and accessibility standards the zip could be downloaded and the curriculum uploaded to Git.Though this would require making sure localization of Thimble is complete but that has to happen (and may have happened) already.Thimble allows markdown\u2026but I agree with you.

These videos are several years old and have been discussed at length in the pop culture sphere, but because new videos, like those featuring Michelle Clark, Michelle Dobyne, and Hazel London continuously make headlines, the original trio are still potent cultural references, even now. Dodson\u2019s known for giving an interview after he helped thwart an attacker who tried to rape his sister, Sweet Brown for a statement she gave soon after her apartment complex caught fire, and Ramsey for the interview he gave to a scrum of reporters moments after rescuing Castro survivors Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus, and Michelle Knight. The way Britt\u2019s character is presented (poor, dressed casually, talking off-the-cuff) parodies the viral stars when they were first caught on camera by a news crew. And the Gregory Brothers\u2019 remixes provide a particularly disorienting filter of the white gaze, in that they give a pleasing, innocuous-seeming lift to grave accounts of violence and danger. Think of the Gregorys\u2019 remixes as modern send-ups of blues tunes transformed into dancing ditties, although the songified blues use real-life trauma and lyrics comprised of formal testimony\u2026Giving an interview to a news station is customary after tragedy; what\u2019s less common is that people become permanently enshrined for their trauma, unless of course, they\u2019re black. The ways trauma is repackaged quickly after interviews are recorded is a result of our fast-moving media cycle. And it\u2019s true that black internet stars have talked to news reporters in memorable ways that make them subject to public fascination. But it\u2019s also true that black viral interviewees hardly had any time to grieve before their feelings were repurposed for the zeitgeist, which is unseemly given how, seen through the mainstream white gaze, black pain has been romanticized (the \u201crace\u201d movies of the early 20th century) or made comical (minstrel shows)\u2026Returning to Hannah Nelson\u2019s claim, that \u201cwe are a nation primarily because we think we are a nation,\u201d is crucial to understand a constant in black culture: the white gaze. Black nationalism, not race, seems to be contingent upon shared experiences or at least a collective perspective, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had a unified view since the civil rights movement, if then. However, the repetition of respectability in the critiques of the viral videos, or that black people should be aware of how they present to the world at all times, is proof that perception continues to be an issue many black people navigate.\u201dBlack Trauma Remixed For Your ClicksWhen the second season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt returns to Netflix this week, viewers will be reacquainted with its\u2026www.buzzfeed.comThis surveillance? So real. Sometimes I will say something witty, or do something unusual, out of the evidently false assumption that I am part of whatever is going on, and the friends I am with \u2014 good friends who know me well \u2014 will stop and stare for a moment and suddenly have re-oriented themselves as my audience and when they laugh it is to each other and it\u2019s a dizzying separation.And I think this exists at an interpersonal level too, where we momentarily marginalize each other as \u2018the forgetful one\u2019 or \u2018the childhish one\u2019 or \u2018the fashionable one\u2019 or whatever and spin narratives of each other around these characterizations, narratives that the subject doesn\u2019t really get the chance to contribute to. We are wrapped up in our own realities and sometimes that spills out into making someone else feel like a character in our story.But I can\u2019t help feeling that I experience this unusually often, relative to my non-black friends, or else wouldn\u2019t someone else also be recognizing and objecting to this?
